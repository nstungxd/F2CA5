<h2>PHP-MySQLi Generator Instructions</h2
>
<p>These scripts for code generation should be used on development servers only, 
unless you add sufficient login security to them, etc. </p>
<p>Open the file connectgenerator.php and fill in your database connection 
variables. Upload connectgenerator.php, showtables.php, showfields.php, and 
createcode.php to a private folder on your website, that is not publicly 
accessible. I suggest using a folder name that is a random string of letters and 
numbers. Then load showtables.php in your browser, and follow the instructions 
shown with it.</p>
<p>To model a database in MS Access and then export it to MySQL, I recommend
<a href="http://www.bullzip.com/products/a2m/info.php">Bullzip's Access to MySQL</a> 
program. It is free, but I recommend giving them a donation.</p>
<p>Use the RawPHP code generator at your own risk. Use the scripts it generates 
at your own risk. The generated scripts do not include user security, so you 
will have to add your own.</p>
<p>You will still have to do a lot of hand coding to customize the generated 
scripts for your application. The code generator simply speeds up development by 
automating some of the repetitive tasks.<br></p>
<p>Most of the MySQLi code for list/add/edit/delete comes from
<a href="http://www.killersites.com/community/index.php?/topic/3064-basic-php-system-view-edit-add-delete-records-with-mysqli/" target="_blank">
http://www.killersites.com/community/index.php?/topic/3064-basic-php-system-view-edit-add-delete-records-with-mysqli/</a> 
and was modified by Lil Peck (RawPHP.com) - LilPeck@gmail.com. Other parts of 
this php code generator comes from various sites I found with google, and 
especially from PHP.net.</p>
