,8,Spectacular. Exceeded Our Expectations  Wowed Our Guests And Provided An Exceptional 5-Star Experience. I Cannot Praise The Staff And Service Enough Particulary The Banqueting Team That Looked After Us  Jeroen And Michael Voigt.,,,,,
,9,Brilliant,,,,,
,10,A Drastic Improvement On Our Very First Stay  Which Has So Far Held Its Case To Be An Anomaly. The Arch Provided Absolutely Exceptional Service On This Occasion  And We Would Not Hesitate To Book Your Hotel Again On Our Next Visit To The City. The Room Was Very Well Kept  Comfortable  And Quiet. Our Breakfast In The Hunter 486 Brasserie Was Of Utmost Quality. It's Only A Shame We Forgot To Make Use Of Our Complimentary Cocktails!,,,,,
,14,We Had An Enjoyable Experience In This Simply Elegant Hotel  Beautifully Designed  With Friendly Staff.  I Was Just Annoyed By The Fact That Every Time A Room Door Opens And Shuts I Could Hear It Very Clearly In My Room (We Stayed At Room 115).,,,,,
,17,It 'S A Very Nice Calm Luxeries Hotel,,,,,
,23,Great Hotel  Location Not Great  Very Helpful Reservations And Chap In Bar (New Hungarian Guy) Most Friendly Staff And Made Good Cocktails,,,,,
,33,The Rooms Were Decent But Noisy. Food Was Good But A Tad Overpriced For What It Was.,,,,,
,46,Very Good Room And Facilities. Only Minor Problems Were The Shower Door Leaked  Not Sure If Sky + Was Meant To Be Enabled And That The Do Not Disturb Panel Kept Changing From Dnd To Service Room! Fortunately This Was Only A Problem On Day One. Otherwise A Great Stay  The Gift On Our Anniversary Was Appreciated And We Were Sad To Be Leaving To Go Back Home.,,,,,
,68,Very Professional And Nice Staff.,,,,,
,69,Excellent. The Service From The Staff Was Outstanding. I Would Like To Commend The Staff At The Front Desk (Especially The Lady Who Checked In For Me On The Morning Of 22 Sep) And The Restaurant (Another Lady Allowed Me To Order Room Service From The Dine-In Restaurant Menu) For Going Beyond The Run-Of-The-Mill Call Of Duty To Ensure I Had The Best Stay Possible.  The Express Checkout Form  And The Complimentary Minibar Drinks Were A Nice Touch. Although I Did Not Make Much Use Of The Minibar  It Exemplified The Hotel's Focus On Service And Good Customer Experience.   Not Only Do I Look Forward To Returning  I've Also Recommended The Arch To My Colleagues For Future Stays In London.,,,,,
,87,Attention To Detail Suberb  Nothing Too Much Trouble - Great Customer Experiance,,,,,
,99,We Had A Lovely Stay At The Arch. Fantastic Location And Very Helpful Staff. Rooms Were Very Comfortable With Everything We Needed. Would Definitely Consider Coming Back  Price Is The Only Limiting Factor!!,,,,,
,100,Had A Very Relaxing And Lovely Stay Was. Impressed The First Stay And My Second Stay So Hopefully A Third Time And More. Most Of Your Staffs Are Very Friendly And Meets To Needs Easily Especially Front Desk Housekeeping And Conceirge. Your Rooms Are Very Neat And Clean Which Is What I Love So Much.  However My Only Complaint Is That The Restaurant Staffs And Those Who Serve Foods (Ie Room Service) Needs Work More On Their Customer Service. A Staff Actually Told Me His Job Is Only To Drop My Food And Can't Go To The Learnt Of Finding Out My Question On The Breakfast He Served As I Thought He Didn't Even Come Back With An Answer Or To Even Pick Up His The Payment Booklet He Left Behind His Answer Came With A Very Rude Look  Thus The Above Was Not Just Him All Who Served My Room Service Food Always Put On And Unfriedly Face I Figured Is Either They Are Angry At Their Job Or Angry They Have To Come Up To The First Floor.  Asides The Above Complaint My Stay Has Always Been Nice And I Won't Let Some Anry Faces Before My Meal Time Stop Me From The Comfort Ofyour Hotel Except Your Service Gets Bad. Thank You  ,,,,,
,120,I Want To Inform You With Wht Happend To Me. I Don't Expect Any Action From Your Side. I Booked A Deluxe Room And When I Chicked In You Reception Team Checked Me In A Room 215 Which They Clam It's A Delux And With All The Meaning It's Not. I Called Them And Said This Is Not The Room We Saw In Your Site Pictures It's Totally A Different Room And Simply They Sid Give Us 5 Min. After5 Minutes They Called And Said They Will Move Us To A Deluxe Room 308. All That Doesn't Matter What Matter For Me They Did It In Purpose And Tried To Fool Me. They Didn't Explain Any Thing Just Changed The Room And That's It.,,,,,
,132,Good Luxurious Hotel  Good Room Tucked Away In The Basement. Staff Is Very Invisible.,,,,,
,142,Very Good. Upgraded Without Asking. Very Quiet Room And Soft Drinks Complementary. Air Conditioning System May Be Too Complex For Use,,,,,
,143,Hotel Was A Nice Place.  Clean  Modern  Very Well Located And Reasonably Priced.  Meals Were Excellent.  Bar Was A Little Quiet.   Enjoyed My Stay Immensely.,,,,,
,144,Delightful  I Would Suggest That You Get A Quality Irish Premium Malt In The Bar.,,,,,
,145,Amazing,,,,,
,170,Lovely Hotel,,,,,
,180,Love The Place  Would Be Outstanding If The Staff Could Recall Names/Faces  But Appreciated Difficult In Busy Places And Team Members Do Depart. The Slight Reduction On Rate Was Appreciated  And Whenevr I'm In Town  The Arch Is My Place To Stay,,,,,
,181,Great Room  With High Quality On Furnitures And Details. Delicious Breakfast And 24 Hour Roomservice.,,,,,
,230,Awesome Stay  And Loved The Infused Water And Nespresso Coffee In The Room.  Just Stunning..... ;-),,,,,
,240,Faultless- But More Importantly Your Staff And The Ambience In The Hotel Made Us Feel Welcome  Comfortable  And A True Guest Rather Than Just One Of Many....,,,,,
,245,Comfortable  Luxurious  Warm  Welcoming,,,,,
,501,My Husband And I Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay At The Arch London. Lovely Hotel And Perfect Location.,,,,,
,502,Lovely Hotel - Intimate And Cosy With Good Facilities And Great Service,,,,,
,503,Great Experience,,,,,
,504,Excellent Location With Attentive Staff.,,,,,
,519,Wonderful Visit!,,,,,
,520,Very Pleasant Stay  Very Freindly Staff.,,,,,
,566,Wonderful Food  Sumptuous Room  Friendly And Solicitous Staff,,,,,
,567,A Lovely Small Hotel With A Execellent Location  Very Serviceminded And Nice Staff Who Greet You Everytime You Enter The Hotel  Which Make You Feel Welcoed  We Had A Suite  Abbey  Wich Was Very Nice And Lots Of Space,,,,,
,592,Sophisticated  Quiet But Right In The Center,,,,,
,593,I Love This Hotel! The Location Is Awesome...The Staff Efficient And Friendly...The Amenities Are Great. Can;T Wait To Return!,,,,,
,594,Friendly Staff  Great Location And Great Value For Money,,,,,
,595,Clean Rooms  Professional Staff  Nice Ambiance.,,,,,
,596,As Good As It Gets Away From Home.,,,,,
,597,Always First Class Service,,,,,
,632,I Had A Larger Room The Last Time; Found The Room Too Small For A 6 Day Stay This Time Esp Since I Was With My Wife; Your Manager Could Not Find Us A Larger Room Even For More $!!  The Room We Got Was Also Odd In That It Faced The Roof And Had Odd Bay Windows Which Were Frosted Ie Restricted Light And View (Albeit Not A Good View).  Not A Great Experience For A Returning Guest.,,,,,
,635,Lovely Room; Comfortable Bed.  Wifi Easily Available Was Great; Television In Room Complicated; Didn't Even Work The First Day.  Television In Bathroom Not Sync'd With Television In Bedroom For Easily Following Shows/News.,,,,,
,644,Very Satisfactory,,,,,
,645,The Best Hotel In Town!,,,,,
,646,Good,,,,,
,659,A Lovely Hotel In A Great Location With Excellent Service,,,,,
,660,We Had A Nice Time. The Rooms Were Spacious  The Staff Great  Continental Breakfast Perfect For Us - But We Also Thought That The Beds Were Not Comfortable. The Couple We Were Traveling With - Loved The Mattress  But For Us - It Was Uncomfortable. Perhaps Because We Weigh More - I Don't Know. I Didn't Think Our View Was That Great And I Would Have Liked A Quieter Street. I Realize Your Street Is Pretty Quiet And I Don't Know If There Is Such A Thing In London. This Was Our First Visit To London. Again  Wonderful Staff And Beautiful Well Equipped Room. Thanks,,,,,
,665,Excellent Location  Attentive Staff  Good Facilities. We Were Disappointed With Room 017 Becasue It Was Dark And We Had No Outlook  Considering We Were There For 5 Nights. We Wish We Had Asked For A Change Of Room Which Was Our Fault.,,,,,
,669,Itis A Fabulous Hotel And Fits With Our Requirements. My Only Criticism Was That We Were Not Informed Of The Roadworks Outside Which Started At 8.00Am  Had We Known We Would Have Insisted On A Room At The Rear Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,688,We Very Much Enjoyed Our Stay As Usual.   Lovely Well Presented Rooms And A Very Well Serviced Restaurant And Bar Area.    Most Of The Staff Very Friendly And Helpful.   One Small Request  Would Like More English Tea Bags In My Room (I Drink Gallons Of Tea!!).  Thank You.,,,,,
,694,Excellent,,,,,
,706,Fantastic Stay As Always!  The Staff Is First Class With A Warm Welcoming Attitude.,,,,,
,709,Very High Standard And Excellent Staff Attitude Creating A Real Feel Good Atmosphere.,,,,,
,710,The Staff's Behaviour Is Professional  Warm And Customer Minded.  Accomododations Are In Line And Sometimes Higher With My Expectations,,,,,
,711,Extremely Good Hotel And Not Too Expensive. Staff Are Very Good And Nothing Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,712,A Very Enjoyable Short Break With Great Accommodation And A Very Pleasant Atmosphere In The Hotel,,,,,
,731,The Hotel Was Very Attractive And Location Was Excellent For Us. Our Room Was Large And Well Appointed. All Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,741,Very Good Except For The Food & Beverage Staff. While They Tried Hard  They Were Painfully Slow And Inefficient.,,,,,
,749,A  Very Pleasant Stay. Very Friendly Staff From Danielo The Friendly Greeter Giovanni At Breakfast Paloma At Dinner To The Friendly And Helpful Concierge Staff With A Special Mention To Thalia.,,,,,
,756,Very Good. Friendly Staff  Well Equipped Room  Nice Design  Good Bed  Excellent Breakfast (Continental)  Central Location  Quiet.,,,,,
,757,An Excellent Experience In Every Way,,,,,
,758,A Most Comfortable Atmosphere And Great Staff.,,,,,
,760,Outstanding Service From Front Desk Staff And Concierge  Theodore.  Very Happy With Accommodation And Location. Room Service Was Prompt And Food Excellent. A New Wait Staff In Dining Room At Breakfast On Saturday Was Untrained And Service Very Disorganized...Therefore Did Not Eat There Again.,,,,,
,769,Overall Experience Was Good  However When Shown Our Room 012  There Was Found A Letter To A Male Quest  Also We Were Promised Our Luggage Would Be Put Into Our Room Which Did Not Happen. I Fail To Understand How A Twin Room Booking Only Warranted A Reservation For Only 1 Breakfast. Positives Were The Room Was Splendid  And The Bed Like Sleeping On A Cloud,,,,,
,772,Pleasurable  Relaxing,,,,,
,773,Excellent Stay...Although Very Expensive At The Time We Booked.  Staff Were Exceptionally Friendly. Gym Facility Excellent As Well.,,,,,
,776,Superb,,,,,
,777,Great Location  Helpful  Friendly Staff. We Had A Wonderful Stay And Is Our Choose Of Hotel In London In The Future.,,,,,
,778,Comfortably Elegant & Convenient,,,,,
,784,It Is A High Quality Small Hotel.  I Wish That I Could Stay Longer.,,,,,
,786,Overall The Experience Was Good. Cheerful Decor And Good Amenities. Efficient Check-In/Check-Out (I Stayed At The Arch Twice Within One Week). Some Minor Inconveniences: 1) The First Time I Checked In  My Room Was Not Cleaned Up (Used Expresso Cups On Table And Laundry Bags On Floor) So I Had To Change Rooms 2) The Second Time I Ordered Breakfast/Room Service  Fruit Salad Was Not Included In My Breakfast Tray Despite Advertising That It Would Be. Other Comments: There Is Quite Some Variation In The Rooms Size. Rooms Towards The Ends Of The Hall (E.G. X16) Tend To Look And Feel Much Larger  With A More Comfortable Layout  Compared To The Room In The Middle (E.G. X07). It Would Be Nice To Be Alerted To This If There Is Room Availability.,,,,,
,787,Nice!,,,,,
,811,Everyone   From The Front Desk To The Housekeeping Staff   Was Most Pleasant And Helpful. Always Had A Smile And 'Hello'. Suggestions Of Where To Go And How To Get There.,,,,,
,814,Very Pleasant And Comfortable,,,,,
,815,Very Good Stuff Good Service Great Location,,,,,
,816,The Nicest Room We Have Stayed In So Far And You Make Us So Welcome. We Love It,,,,,
,817,Junior Suite Was Lovely  Spacious And Well Appointed.  Extra Large Bathroom With The Best Shower Ever (Suite 16)  Only Complaint Was That The Room Being On The Ground Floor Was Not That Private And A Bit Noisy (Street) Also  We Prefer A Room With More Natural Light.,,,,,
,818,Excellent  No Concerns,,,,,
,970,Wonderful Small Hotel  Feel Like Home,,,,,
,971,Very Enjoyable  Staff Were Very Friendly And Attentive And Rooms Were Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,972,We Really Enjoyed Our Three Nights At The Arch.  The Location Is Excellent  And The Quality Of The Rooms And Amenities For The Price (Well It Is London) Is Very Good.,,,,,
,973,Wonderful Except For The Guests Above Who Always Woke Us Early In The Morning Because They Were Very Noisy.  The Room Was Very Small But Lovely.   I Prefer A Little More Space.   Thanks.,,,,,
,974,Very Nice!,,,,,
,975,I Had An Enjoyable Stay And Will Recommend To Others.,,,,,
,976,I Am A Travel Agent And I Absouletly Loved The Arch!   I Will Be Definitely Selling Your Hotel To Clients And I Will Be Back Myself.,,,,,
,978,Wonderful Experience  Great Hotel,,,,,
,979,Attention To Detail Was Second To None.  Loved The Closing Of The Curtains And Bedside Bottle Of Water Each Evening When We Returned To Our Room.  The Room Was So Quiet And The Bed Was Amazingly Comfortable.,,,,,
,980,Fantastic,,,,,
,982,Hotel Very Comfortable. Staff Great. Beds Comfy  Coffee And Tea Fab. Restaurant Not Very Good  Need A New Chef? Also  And Reason Why I Probably Wont Be Back...The Noise Insulation Inside The Hotel Is...Awful. The Problem  The Corridors ..You Can Hear Every Person Walking By Or Cleaning..Creaking Floors And Vibration. Worse...Upstairs Noise. I Lost Hours Of Sleep  And I Mean Hours  Because The People Staying Upstairs Were Partying  And Then Pounding From The Bed Upstairs. I Don't Think I Need To Say More. Awful Sleep. ,,,,,
,983,Overall  We Had An Enjoyable Stay.  The Room Was Small But Comfortable  And The Facilities And Cleanliness Excellent.  Best Of All  It Was Quiet At Night.  My Only Negative Comment Was That The Bathtub Did Not Drain Well.  When Showering  We Stood In A Few Inches Of Water.  We Should Have Brought It To The Front Desk's Attention  But Were Too Busy During Out Stay.  Would Recommend To Others  Particularly Given Location.,,,,,
,984,Very Enjoyable Stay,,,,,
,985,Excellent Location  Close To What We Were In London For  Close To The Hustle And Bustle Of The City But Lovely Quiet Location. Excellent Rooms  Very Well Appointed And Excellent In Room Facilities. Better Quality Toilet Roll Would Be Nice! The Only Draw Back Was That The Staff Because Of Their Nationalities Were Difficult To Understand.,,,,,
,986,Excellent For Both Business And Pleasure.  All The Staff Are Amazing!,,,,,
,990,Very Enjoyable And Comfortable.  A Lovely Home Away From Home.,,,,,
,995,Loved It. Rooms Were Exactly As Depicted Online. Staff Was Very Friendly And Helpful. Only Compliant Would Be That We Asked For A Recommendation For A Japanesse Restaurant And The Front Desk Staff Sent Us To A Chinese Restaurant. We Had To Search For Another Taxi And Start Our Restaurant Search Again.  Japanese Food And Chinese Food Are Different.,,,,,
,998,I Was Extremely Happy With Everything About My Stay Except For The Noisy Squeeky/Loose Floorboards -Which Are Only Annoying When Trying To Sleep.  The Staff  Free Wifi  Breakfast Minibar  Coffee And Sky Tv Were Really Great Touches.  The Location Is Perfect Too!,,,,,
,999,Professional And Friendly Staff Make The Difference From Other Hotels.,,,,,
,1000,I Enjoyed My Stay Very Much,,,,,
,1001,Our Stay At The Arch Was Fantastic From The Moment We Arrived And The Hotel Surpassed All Expectations.  The Staff Went Out Of Their Way To Make Our Stay Comfotable And Even Though We Only Stayed For 1 Night  It Was A Very Relaxing Break.  We Will Definitely Return. ,,,,,
,1002,The Latest Visit Was Not As Good As Previous Visits. We Were Placed In A Smaller Room At The Front Of The Hotel And Various Extras Were Forgotten.Eg) We Ordered A Morning Newspaper That Never Arrived  The Safe In The Room Was Broken.,,,,,
,1004,Great Room  Attentive And Friendly Staff.,,,,,
,1008,Pleasent.,,,,,
,1009,Very Welcoming ,,,,,
,1011,Excellent  As Usual!  Only Wish That The Restaurant Was More Efficient On Checking Up On The Table And Bringing Drink Replenishment Faster.  Also Really Miss The Crisps!  Wish There Were Some Nicer Snacks When Having A Drink.  Other Than That  An Amazing Hotel! :),,,,,
,1014,A Very Good Human Five Stars Hotel. The Only Thing That You Can Improve Is Concerning The Bathroom  The Water Had Difficulty To Go By In The Bath.,,,,,
,1019,It Was Very Good.   I Ate Twice In The Restaurant.  Once On A Weekday After The Busy Morning Period And The Service Was Good.  I Ate Also On The Sunday After The Busy Period And The Service Was A Bit Lacking.  I Waited A Good Period To Order And Then My Food Came Before I Had Any Coffee Or Tea Or Juice.   The Bill Was Also Erroneous.   The Seating Personnel Was Very Good.

Otherwise I Very Much Enjoyed My Stay.

A Couple Other Comments - It Would Be Useful To Have The Address And Phone Number Of The Hotel In Something That Is Email Friendly.  When On A Handheld Device It Is Not Easy To Read The Number Or Address Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,1020,In General  It Was A Good Experience. The Front Desk And Concierge's Services Were Remarkable. The Only Little Problem Was The Room''s Dimension. The Extra Bed  As A Matter Of Fact  Im My Opinion  Doesn't Fit  In The Room. I've Been Very Satisfied With The Breakfast And The Brasserie's Food  Mostly With The Employees Who Work There : They Are Very Polite And Smart. Congratulations.,,,,,
,1021,We Really Enjoyed The Stay  We Have Stayed In Many London Hotels Regularly And Never Normally Return With The Odd Exception  Your Hotel Is Now On Our List As One Of Those Exceptions.,,,,,
,1022,We Loved The Hotel  We Stay Regularly In London And Do Not Normally Stay At The Same Hotel Again With The Odd Exception  Your Hotel Is Now On Our List Of Exceptions!,,,,,
,1023,As Usual Very Enjoyable.,,,,,

7,Do You Have Any Other Comments Regarding Your Arrival And/Or Any Pre Arrival Contact?,,,,,,
,Total Responses:,172,,,,,
,Not Answered:,0,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,
,1,Last-Minute Booking (From Day Before) Seemed To Lack Some Preparation  Specifically Regarding Details Of The Booking I.E. Complimentary Cocktails  Stylish Welcome Gift  Room Upgrade,,,,,
,5,Seamless  Effortless And Accommodating.,,,,,
,6,The Woman At The Front Desk Was Not Very Friendly. Everyone Else Was Very  Very Nice Though!,,,,,
,13,I Dont Know His Name But The Man Who Was On The Front Door In The Mornings Was Very Friendly And Always Said Hello.,,,,,
,14,I Had Booked My Room Online With An Option To Upgrade For 80 Pounds If Rooms Are Available. I Was Told The Hotel Was Fully Booked But I'm Not Sure All Executive Rooms Were Booked.,,,,,
,15,My Tv Didn't Work The Whole Time I Was There,,,,,
,16,No,,,,,
,17,No,,,,,
,18,Staff Tried Their Best To Find A Room For Me As I Wanted To Check In Early After A Long Flight. Really Appreciated That.,,,,,
,19,Su  The Porter Was Lovely And We Had A Great Chat With Him Whilst He Showed Us The Way To Our Room.,,,,,
,20,The One Thing That Made The Stay From Being Good Was The Quality Of The Mattress. If You Checked In Room 319  The Mattress Has Lost It's Hold. It Slumps Down On The Left And The Right  Whilst A Good Mattress Shouldn't Do This. It Requires Replacing. Definitely Very Different From What I Remembered From My Last Stay.,,,,,
,21,There Was Confusion And A Delayed Check-In Due To Someone Having Smoked In The Room. It Was Handled Well But Did Cause A Long Delay In Finally Getting To The Room.,,,,,
,22,Tv Remote Was Not In The Room (Every Time I Stay At The Arch There Is Always S.Th. Wrong With The Tv); No Adapter In The Room Even Though I Had Requested One,,,,,
,23,Was Not Told About Valet Parking Despite Asking About Parking,,,,,
,40,As A Honored Member Of Slh  I Should Have Received A Welcome Drink And Automatic Upgrade. I Was Initially Told An Upgrade Was Not Possible  But When I Checked The Arch's Own Website Found This Not To Be The Case.  Could Have Been A Mistake Or Unwillingness To Upgrade.  On A Positive Note  Theo The Concierge Was Extremely Helpful Pre Arrival With Arranging A Haircut Appt.,,,,,
,41,Even Though We Had Booked The Previous Day So That We Would Be Able To Immediately Check Into Our Room To Rest When We Arrived In The Morning  Our Room Was Not Ready.  They Did Waive The Charges For The Day Previous Day That We Had Reserved  Of Course. Also  We Didn't Like The Video Installation Playing In The Lobby Of The Plastic Gloves On A Fence And So On.  Aside From That  The Hotel And The Staff Were Perfect!  The Restaurant And Bar Are Wonderful And Beautiful.,,,,,
,42,Since We Do Come On Business Every Month  I Really Would Recommend That Our Rooms Are Ready On Arrival Or At Least 1 Room For The Girls And 1 For The Boys So We Can Shower And Change Before We Start Working  I Also Recommend That We Are Allowed A Later Check-Out So We Can Work Later Into The Day And Shower Before We Fly Home.,,,,,
,46,All The Staff Were Friendly And Helpful  But The Doormen Were Particularly Good So A Special Thanks To Them,,,,,
,47,Excellent Service From All Staff Members  Very Efficient.,,,,,
,48,Excellent Staff Welcome,,,,,
,49,I Absolutely Love This Hotel. My Room Was Beautiful As Well As Comfortable But I Stayed On The Lower Level And The Foot Traffic From The Lobby Above Was Very Heavy And Loud.  The Staff Was Very Friendly And Helpful And I Would Love To Stay Here In The Future.,,,,,
,50,I Stay At The Arch A Lot. However  When I Call To Reserve  There Always Seems To Be Quite Some Difficulty In Finding My Contact Details From Previous Stays And Details Of Summit's Corporate Rate.  This Does Make The Reservation Process Longer And More Frustrating Than It Need Be.,,,,,
,51,It Was Strange To Be Sat Down Whilst Checking In But Pleasent,,,,,
,52,It Was Very Helpful To Have Pre-Arrival Communications By Email With The Hotel Staff.,,,,,
,53,Jeorome Was Very Very Helpful In Organising Events For Me Over The Weekend. Generally The Staff Was Very Accommodating To Our Large Group. Thank You!!! We Will Be Back :),,,,,
,54,My Wife's Birthday  We Received An Upgrade  And Chocolates In The Room  Which Was Excellent  And Got Her Birthday Treat Off To A Great Start!  Thanks To All.,,,,,
,55,No Mention Of 150-Pounds Incedental Expenses Charge (How Much  Whether It Was Per Night E.T.C.). Whilst Some Sort Of Charge Was Expected  This Was Only From Experiance  Not Through Any Correspodence From The Hotel Nor Was This Information Provided At Booking.,,,,,
,56,None  My Stay Was Amazing,,,,,
,57,Pre Arrival Mail Exchange: I Received Quickly Your Answer Which I Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,58,Room Was A Bit Cold  As Was The Gym.,,,,,
,59,Staff Were Extremely Helpful With Recommendations For Dinner And Other Reservations,,,,,
,60,Thank You For A Wonderful Stay.  We Loved The Hotel  Staff  Location And Having Delicious Food As Room Service!,,,,,
,61,Very Thoughtful And Friendly Staff  With Excellent Attention To Detail!,,,,,
,62,We Paid The Room Charge Upfront In Cash But The Receptionist Request An Additional 100 Deposit Per Day To Cover Any Futhur Charges Throughout Our Stay. We Felt This Was Unnecessary.,,,,,
,120,The Worst Check In Ever. No Introduction For The Hotel Facilities And Services . Exactly What Happend Is Giving Them My Name And Review My Package And Through Me In The Room.,,,,,
,121,We Arrived At 3Pm And The Room Wasn T Ready Yet. The Girl At The Reception Was Highly Unpleaseant And Didn T Apologized For The Delay.....Not Accettable,,,,,
,122,We Were Unable To Check Into Our Rooms Until Around 4-5Pm Due To Housekeeping Not Cleaning The Room.  Having Just Arrived On A Nine-Hour Flight  We Were Tired And Anxious To Check In Our Hotel Room.  This Delay Did Not Give Us A Good First Impression Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,123,Almost All Your Personnal Is Professionnal But There Is One Girl  Do Not Remember Her Name ( Italian ) That Has No Idea How To Speaks To Guest.,,,,,
,124,Before My Arrival I Had Some Questions So I Emailed And Did Not Receive Prompt Replies If At All.,,,,,
,125,Check In Is Informal And I Waited On The Small Sofa Until The Staff Was Ready To Serve Me.  I Think They Should Have Asked Me The Purpose Of My Visit And If I Needed Any Information Or Help Planning For My Visit.  I Think That A Good Check In At A Luxury Property Involves Solving (Or Hopefully) Preventing Problems.  The Bellman David Was Outstanding!  He Helped With My Bags  But Gave The Perfect Tour Of The Room And All Its Features.  He Was The Star Of The Show And Also Sold Me On Checking Out The Bar.,,,,,
,126,Doorman Very Helpful And Accommodating,,,,,
,127,Everyone Is Lovely. The Nepresso Machines In The Room Are Fantastic  Especially If Arriving From Overseas! I Will Definitely Stay Again.,,,,,
,128,Great To Facilitate Early Check In,,,,,
,129,I Had Requested Online When I Booked To Have A Top Floor Room And Early Check In If Possible. When I Arrived Neither Of Those Was Available  I Was Told I Could Have A Ground Floor Room And A 3:00 Check In. I Was Disappointed  And Went Out To Walk Around To Wait For 3:00. When I Returned At 3:00 I Was Met At The Desk By A Different Person Who Told Me I Could In Fact Have A Top Floor Room  And Very Efficiently Checked Us In. The Experience With The Second Person Was Very Different Than With The First. (The First Was A Young Female  The Second A Slightly Older Man.),,,,,
,130,I Have Found That Not All The Staff Are Fully Knowledgable.  They Are Lovely  But Seems It Can Take More Time Than Needed To Get A Question Answered.,,,,,
,131,I Would Have Appreciated Someone At The Desk Spoke A Little French. I Have Been In Several Hotels In London Even A Lower Class  Yet The Receptionist Spoke French.,,,,,
,132,It Was Very Professional. Maybe A Bot Too Much. We Are Not Robots. I Missed A Personal Touch  A Warm Atmosphere. (But I Guess This Is Very Personal. It Is A Not A Negative Comment.),,,,,
,133,It Would Have Been Great To Have A Shower (Maybe In The Gym?) We Arrived Early After A Long Haul Flight  And Had To Get Straight To Work  Before We Were Able To Check In. Hotels We Stayed At Previously  Had Showers For This Purpose.,,,,,
,134,Last Time When I Stayed  And Was Checking Out   I Found Out That Some Of The Bar's Checks And Invoices Were Added To My Room  Which I Never Signed  And So Didn't Order And Have It. The Staff Then Clarified And Did Not Include In My Bill  But Was Suprised Myself That It Was Added To My Room,,,,,
,135,My Room Was Not Ready When I Arrived And The Staff Was Helpful In Accommodating Me.,,,,,
,136,We Arrived At 6Pm And Our Room Was Not Ready. This Was Confusing To Us  As By That Time Our Room Should Definitely Be Ready. We Were Offered A Drink At The Bar  But Really I Don't Think That Is Enough Compensation For Not Having A Room Ready At 6Pm. Staff Were Friendly  But We Were A Bit Disappointed By This.,,,,,
,137,We Had Booked A Twin-Bedded Room But Got A Kingsize Bed. Although My Complaint At My Arrival  We Got No Offer To Change The Room.,,,,,
,138,When I Arrived I Had A Very Heavy Bag And There Was No One At The Door To Help  Which Was A Shame As At Every Other Occasion The Doorman Was Fantastic.,,,,,
,198,Check Inn Process Takes Too Long Esp. For Almost Weekly Customers  Eg Taking Credit Card Authorizations All The Time,,,,,
,199,I Have Stayed At The Arch Many Times And Always Requested A Specific Room In Advance.  The Answer Has Always Been: 'No Problem  We Will Set That Room Aside For You.'  This Time  However  I Was Told Repeatedly That Room Requests Could Not Be Guaranteed And Would Be Determined Upon Arrival.  When I Did Arrive  The Personnel At The Front Desk Could Not Accommodate My Request And Showed No Urgency Whatsoever In Securing Something Similar.  I Waited For Nearly Two Hours And Was Finally Given A Room That Didn't Come Close To Meeting What I Had Specified.  To Make Matters Worse  Due To Faulty Electronics In That Room  I Still Had To Be Switched Several Hours Later.  It Was An Extremely Disappointing And Frustrating Experience  Especially Given How Well I've Been Treated By The Arch In The Past.  It Wasn't Until I Could Finally Speak To A Manager That Things Improved.,,,,,
,200,Mukesh Sharma Did Not Understand My Booking Request  Only Did One Booking Instead Of Two (For Myself And A Collegaue) And Apparntly You Are Not Using The Information In The System Which Makes Bookings As Well As Checkin In Time Consuming And Inefficient.,,,,,
,201,Some Of The Female Front Desk Staff Were Not Very Forward Thinking And Were Not Able To Understand Nor Implement Simply Requests. Same For The Consierge. One Person Who Has Provided Service Over And Beyond And Made Our Stay Enjoyable Was Duty Manager Maris Tues. For Sure He Was More Then Helpful!,,,,,
,202,Yes- I Have Stayed At Your Hotel 15 Times In The Past  Yet - Their Is Always Confusion About My Contact Information And I Have To Provide It Everytime And It Never Gets Stored Correctly On My Profile In Your Systems. I Prefer A Room Facing The Street And Everytime They Assure Me That Has Been Stored In My Profile But It Isn't And Ai Get A Room Facing The Courtyard Where The Noisy Air Conditioner Is Located. There Should Be Easier Ways To Book Rooms For Frequent Travelers.,,,,,
,203,I Booked A Superior Room With My Friend And On Arrival Was Taken To A Basement Floor Room  Which Looked Out At Eye Level At A Car Park And Garages. It Was Extremely Small With A Terrible Outlook. I  Refused To Stay In This Room And Was Amazed That This Would Be Considered Superior  It Was Awful With Cars Parking And Residential Entrances Not Quiet At All. After 15 Minutes We Were Found A Room On The 2Nd Floor That Was Much Better. Staff Were Helpful.,,,,,
,204,Sloooooooow Check In,,,,,
,207,All Went Very Smoothly,,,,,
,208,Always Consistent And High Quality Service From Every Employee Encountered - From Booking Until Checkout. Impressed By Personalised Service At Check Out And Remembering Previous Stays And That I Had A Problem With The Internet - A Rare Thing!,,,,,
,209,As Soon As I Got Out Of The Taxi  Someone Was There To Greet Me. I Was So Impressed By The Building And The Entrance. I Felt Comfortable. Loved The Artwork In The Hall,,,,,
,210,Best Stay I Have Had In London I. Some Time Xx,,,,,
,211,Everything Was Great!,,,,,
,212,Excellent Service On Check-In And Were Very Happy To Be Given An Early Check-In After A Very Long Flight From Sydney!,,,,,
,213,Fast And Efficient - Warm And Friendly Service.,,,,,
,214,Great Stay  Omar The Concierge Was Brilliant Securing Us A Table At The Ledbury Which We Had Failed To Do Before Our Arrival. We Asked For A V Quiet Room And Our Room Definitely Met This Requirement.,,,,,
,215,I Am Very Grateful To Yoru Staff For An Early Check In After My Flight From Australia,,,,,
,216,I Emailed The Hotel 2 Days Before Our Arrival To Reconfirm Our Arrival Time & Special Requests. Our 2 Rooms Were Ready But Were Not Actually Connecting Rooms As Had Been Described In Our Booking Through Slh & In Several Phone & Email Exchanges With The Hotel. Our Inquiry About A Stroller Which Was Supposed To Have Been Followed Up By The Concierge Was Never Followed Up. A Separate Room Which I Had Booked Separately For Our Family Member Was Not In Order As I Had Requested - We Had Requested Twin Beds & A Crib  Neither Of Which Were There; They Had To Change Rooms. We Booked Through Slh But Received No Upgrade Or Special Arrival Welcome.,,,,,
,217,I Stayed At The Arch Three Times Between June 14 And July 15.  I Love The Area Of The Hotel But Would Highly Recommend That The Staff Guide Guests To Walk Along Seymour Street Instead Of Walking Along Oxford Street (Which Is What Any Google Map Will Tell You To Do If You Are Looking For Directions) As It Is A Far Less Busy/Stinky (!) Street With Some Great Shops  And Takes You Right To Charlotte Street In Soho.  I Unfortunately Only Discovered That Fact On My Last Day In London.  Wish I Had Known That From The Time I Arrived.,,,,,
,218,I Travelled By Car And Upon Arrival My Car Was Taken To The Nearby Car Park And My Luggage Taken Care Of Which Made Me Relax Immediately,,,,,
,219,It Has Been A True Pleasure For Our Family To Stay At The Arch.  We Have Extended Family That Agrees! The Entire Staff Is Wonderful And Efficient On Every Level.  We Look Forward To Staying Again.,,,,,
,220,It Is Always A Pleasure To Stay At The Arch. The Room Upgrade Was A Nice Touch   Especially After A Long Flight. Was Very Pleased That The Room Was Ready Immediately Upon Checking In The Morning.,,,,,
,221,Love Your Team. I Spend On Average 40 Nights At Your Hotel Each Year And I Expect To Keep Coming Back. Definitely My Preferred London Destination.,,,,,
,222,Lovely Polite Staff  Very Clean And Tidy Room And Super Comfortable (And Quiet) Bed :),,,,,
,223,My Stay Was Truly Fantastic. On Check You Remembered The Reason For Stay (Wifes 40Th) Which Was Great. During The Stay I Had A Serious Reaction To Something I'd Eaten / Drank In The Evening. This Caused My Body To Go Into Shock And Ended Up With A Blackout In The Bathroom Resulting A Gashed Head. Your Staff Where Fantastic Support For My Wife And Also Ensured The Ambulance Got There Quickly. I Can't Thank You Enough. I'm Really Looking Forward To Our Next Stay There. Phil.,,,,,
,224,My Wife Was Very Pleased With The Champagne I Ordered And Very Touched With The Excellent Raspberry Petit Fours And Happy Birthday Written On The Plate In Chocolate - Thank-You For Doing This!,,,,,
,225,Need To Compliment Your Staff Members:  Theo  Maurice  The Two Door Man (Not Recall Their Names One Asian  The Other One Black) And The Staff At The Restaurant.  All Of Them Were More Than Attentive  Great Attitude And For Sure Made My Experience Great. Kudos To Them!,,,,,
,226,No,,,,,
,227,No,,,,,
,228,No,,,,,
,229,No Additional Comments.,,,,,
,230,No  Nothing.,,,,,
,231,Not Pertaining To This Particular Visit  However I Have Tried Subsequently To Book 5 Separate Dates Between Now And Year End At Our Corporate Rate (210-Pounds & Vat) Only To Be Told That The Only Rooms Available Are Well Over 300-Pounds. This Means I Have Had To Go Elsewhere For All Of The Future Dates Unfortunately!,,,,,
,232,Only Criticism Would Be Some Creaky Floorboards In The Corridor Outside Our Room  No.508. Other Than That We Had A Lovely Stay. Also  The Food Was Very Good.,,,,,
,233,Our Stay With You Was A Pleasure. I Arrived At Around 11:00 & Was Able To Book In Early. The Staff Were Friendly & Helpful. The Room Was Beautiful & The Breakfast Was Excellent!,,,,,
,234,Over The Last 2 Years I Have Traveled To London 8 Times And This Has Been My Best Experience So Far. I Loved The Friendliness And Professionality Of The Staff!!,,,,,
,235,Pre Checked In As Arriving At 10Am And Paid For Night Before. Was Handled Well And Room Ready.,,,,,
,236,Really Great Experience.  Feels Like My London Home!  Todd,,,,,
,237,Some Of The More Eurpoean Staff Have An Emotionally Hard Side. They Seem Tense Or Worried About Their Job?,,,,,
,238,Staff Were Courteous And Accommodating - Keen To Assist  But Not Too Overwhelming.,,,,,
,239,Thank You For Having A Room Ready For Me After The Overnight Flight From Usa!,,,,,
,240,The Free Upgrade To Our Room  Bearing In Mind It Was Rebecca's Birthday Was Hugely Appreciated.  I Just Wish I'd Taken The Name Of The Male Receptionist As He Was Fantastic And Deserves To Be Recognised To The General Manager.,,,,,
,241,The Personal Touch Of A Box Of Chocolates And Handwritten Note Was Very Kind And Greatly Appreciated - Thank You!,,,,,
,242,The Quality Of Service Was Great And Overall  The Staff Was Very Reactive And Efficient.,,,,,
,243,The Welcome Was Very Warm And Friendly With A Quick Checkin. Free Wifi And Mini Bar Drinks Were Also A Lovely Touch.,,,,,
,244,Unfortunately We Were Very Tired When We Arrived At The Hotel  And All We Wanted Was A Lite Bite To Eat And To Go Straight To Sleep.  We Were In Room 005 And After Being Asleep For A Couple Of Hours  The Noises Began Around Midnight. It Sounded Like Trolleys Wheeling  Doors Banging And Quick Footsteps. On And Off Throughout The Night This Noise Woke Us Up. Being So Tired We Didn't Even Think To Call Anyone  We Just Wanted It To Stop  It Only Lasted 10 Minutes At A Time. But It Was Enough To Seriously Disturb Our Sleep And Effect Our Overall Impression Of The Hotel.  We Probably Would Stay Again  But We Would Not Accept A Room Int He Basement. Everything Else About Our Stay Was Perfect  This Really Was The Only Issue.,,,,,
,245,Very Efficient  Helpful Re Luggage  Welcoming Re Drinks  Informal Yet Polite Re Showing To Room,,,,,
,246,Very Friendly  Professional Service,,,,,
,247,We Absolutely Loved Our Stay At Your Warm  Friendly And Service Oriented Hotel. We Rented Two Rooms And Both Were Beautifully Decorated And Well Maintained. The Friendly Service From Your Staff Was Refreshing And Their Attention To Detail Was Amazing. Everyone Was Pleasant And More Than Willing To Share A Laugh Or Inquire As To How They Could Make Our Visit To London Even Better. It Was An Amazing Vacation And One That We Will Share Again Sometime In The Future At The Arch. Thank You For Everything.,,,,,
,248,We Dealt With Michele Ho For Our Corporate Event And Her Level Of Professionalism And Welcome Was The Best I Have Ever Received.,,,,,
,249,We Had One Room Booked For A Colleague Who Didn't End Up Making The Trip And The No-Show Fee Was A Bit On The Pricey Side... Understandable That You Charge Something  But The Full Cost Of One Night Seemed A Bit Steep.,,,,,
,250,We Loved The Hotel.,,,,,
,629,Booking In Process Could Be Improved The Reception Area Around The Desk Is Rather Cramped And Could Be Better Organised.  The Layout Of Chairs At The Desk And No Demarcation Between The Individual Workstations Can Lead To Confusion Over Who Is Being Served  Who Is Waiting And Which Staff Are Free.,,,,,
,630,Helpful Staff When I Phoned Re Car Parking.,,,,,
,631,Took A Little Longer Than Normal To Check In As Allocated Room Wasn't Ready.  But Not A Problem At All.  The Room I Had (008) Was Excellent.,,,,,
,632,Warmth And Friendliness Was Not Consistent Across All Staff,,,,,
,652,Room Was Not Ready Yet,,,,,
,656,A Little Gem In The Heart Of Bustling London Town. I Constantly Recommend You To Our Senior Management People Based In The Us.,,,,,
,657,Always Enjoy My Stay And Thank You For The Fruit Platter.,,,,,
,658,Bit Fed Up With Getting A Survey Every Time I Stay,,,,,
,659,Booking Was Easy  When I Had A Question  I Emailed And Received Almost An Immediate Response. Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,660,Easy And Smooth.,,,,,
,661,Enjoyed It.,,,,,
,662,Excellent All Around.,,,,,
,663,Front Desk Did Not Have The Rate Quoted In My Confirmation  But Resolved Quickly.,,,,,
,664,Generally V Good But Someone Gave Erroneous Info Re Breakfast Times To Our Friends Who Were Staying There For First Time Also As A Regular Would Prefer If Possible To Know Room We Were Staying In Not Next To Lift Next Time Please  Reuben Berg,,,,,
,665,I Had Made Telephone Contact Previously To Change My Booking Status. I Had Also Made A Point That We Did Not Have To Be On The Ground Floor Or Have Adjoining Rooms.,,,,,
,666,I Like The Arch. My Firm Have Used It For Business Events When We Need To Stay Over  For Business Lunches  Drinks And Coffees. Keep Up The Good Work!,,,,,
,667,I'm Just Getting Over An Illness And Walking With The Help Of Crutches And In Need Of A High Chair To Sit At A Table. Your Staff Could Not Have Been More Helpful. In Particular Your Duty Manager Alex Was Outstanding.,,,,,
,668,Last Minute Booking.  Hotel Was Full. Reservations / Reception Contacted Me The Moment A Room Became Avaialble.  All Very Good,,,,,
,669,No,,,,,
,670,One Of The Best Hotels We Have Ever Stayed At - The Staff Were Very Friendly From Front Desk To The Restaurant - Overall A Wonderful Experience - Next Time London We Will Be Staying At The Arch Hotel.,,,,,
,671,Our Stay At The Hotel Was Faultless And Would And Have Recommended The Hotel.,,,,,
,672,Perfect And Completely Stress-Free,,,,,
,673,Quick  Efficient And Courteous,,,,,
,674,Staff Is Amazing!,,,,,
,675,Thanks Again Yet Another Successful Stay At The Arch.  Thanks For Making Our Family Celebration Really Special.  This Our  Go To Place When Staying In London  The Hotel Has The Quality We Want But Also A Home From Home Feel.  Well Done To The Arch Staff For Giving Such Good Service.,,,,,
,676,The Concierge  Theo  Was Extremely Helpful And Responded Very Quickly To Email Inquiries. The Front Desk  When Contacted By Phone  Were Very Courteous And Efficient.,,,,,
,677,The Electronic Key Card We Were Given Did Not Open The Door And We Had To Wait For A Replacement. This Was Provided Within 5-10 Minutes So Not A Big Deal But It's A Bit Tedious To Arrive At The Door Of The Room And Not Be Able To Get In.,,,,,
,678,The Front Desk Staff Were All Extremely Helpful.  My Husband And I Travel Frequently And Were Impressed By Their Professionalism.  The Gentleman Who Helped Us To Our Room Was Also Very Efficient And Helpful With Our Numerous Questions.,,,,,
,679,The Hotel Is Very Comfortable And When You Travel For Business You Feel At Home . The Staff Is Wonderful And Very Helpful And The Hotel Is Spotless. Rooms Are Lovely.,,,,,
,680,The Location In Quiet Yet Convenient To Getting Around Town.  The Bed Was Extremely Comfortable  The Food Was Very Good And Staff Was Always Willing To Assist.,,,,,
,681,Theo  Made Arrival And Check In Easy And Quick  After A Long Transatlantic Flight.,,,,,
,682,There Was Some Confusion About The Dates Of Our Stay But The Staff Handled The Situation Well And Made Us Comfortable Immediately.,,,,,
,683,Very Much Appreciated Being Contacted To Discuss The Room Selection.,,,,,
,684,We Arrived Very Early In The Morning And The Staff Was Very Accomodating,,,,,
,685,We Initially Booked A Twin Room Deluxe For 4 Days Through Olotels. We Were Given Room 217 Which Is Not Twin And Not Deluxe. However  Since We Arrived Early And Were Allowed To Check In Early  We Did Not Complain.  When We Tried To Extend Our Stay For Another 7 Days At The Front Desk  We Were Told No Rooms Were Available In Our Price Range. However  They Were Available Through The Booking Engine  So We Were Compelled To Book Again Through Olotels. We Would Have Moved To Another Hotel  But Stayed For 2 Reasons: 1) The Upcoming Medical Procesure Which Would Have Made A Move Difficult 2) The Excellent Level Of Service By Most Of The Staff ,,,,,
,740,I Detected A Slight Aloofness/Abruptness On The Part Of The Receptionist But Nothing Serious. Probably My English Sensitivity And Certainly Nothing To Be Concerned About.,,,,,
,741,Susanna D. Was Very Helpful With Our Booking And Arrival Concerns.,,,,,
,748,Could Not Get The Room I Had Requested,,,,,
,749,Everything Was Excellent!!!!,,,,,
,750,Excellent,,,,,
,751,No It Is Excellant,,,,,
,752,No  Excellent As Usual,,,,,
,753,Our Room No Was 518  The People In The Opposite Room 517 Where Noisy To Say The Least. They Came In At 5.30 Am And Immediately Started Playing Music Very Loudly. I Complained To Reception And The Music Ceased Only To Start Again At 6.00Am. Obviously We Had No Sleep From 5.30 And Were No Happy At All. I Realise That The Hotel Staff Can Only Ask The People To Be Quieter  However I Do Think That These People Should Be Prevented From Stopping At The Arch Again.,,,,,
,754,Sometimes Takes Too Long To Find Out Whether Room Is Ready. Sometimes Have To Wait Too Long For Room. Staff  However  Invariably Polite And Attentive.,,,,,
,755,We Really Liked The Staff And The Room.,,,,,
,783,Slight Aloofness Or Abruptness Detected On The Part Of The Receptionist But Nothing Serious - Probably My English Sensitivity!,,,,,
,784,The Room Decoration Is Nice.  The Common Reception Room And Martini Room Are Welcoming. The Reception Staff Were A Bit Cold  As If They Have Seen Too Much  Perhaps.  Other Staff  Eg Door Man  Waiting Staff Were Much Warmer,,,,,
,801,I Have Stayed At Your Hotel 15 Times. The Beds In The Rooms Are Way Too Soft For My Taste  I Always Request A Room On The Street Side  But Never Seem To Get It Unless I Ask And Get Upgraded. The Air Conditioning Did Not Work. The Air Conditioning Unit Outside My Room Hummed All Night Long And Could Not Sleep Well. This Last Stay Was Aslo Egregiously Expensive For The Room I Had  Just A Standard Room For 400 Pounds - At That Price Its A Terrible Value For The Reasons I Raise Above. Will Not Stay Again If I Have Another Experience Like This And Many People At The Firm I Work For Stay Here As Well After My Referral - Will Probably Stop Referring Folks To The Hotel As Well. Quality Is Diminishing And Perks For Frequent Guests Such As Myself Non-Existent - Such As Room Preference  Ease Of Reservations  Speedy Checkout And Checkin  And Storage Of My Data In A Profile - Have To Start Over With Providing My Data Everytime I Stay.,,,,,
,802,I Would Have Appreciated Someone At The Desk Spoke A Little French. Actually I've Been In Other Hotels In London Ranked Lower And There Was Always Someone At The Reception Who Spoke French.,,,,,
,803,The Staff Was Mostly Professional And Friendly. However  They Failed To Address A Specific Request That Was Part Of The Reservation Arrangements -- Switching To A Double Bed Room For The Last Day Of My Stay. I Should Not Be Made To Feel As If I Made An Error In My Travel Arrangements Especially When The Confirmation Details And Itinerary Specified The Request For A Double Room. I Was Given The Same Room Where I Had Stay For The Majority Of My Visit  But With The King Bed Pulled Apart To Feature Two Single Beds. This Worked Out Fine  But They Were Not The Double Beds I Had Reserved And Paid For.  Also  Given The Location Of My Room  There Was Quite A Lot Of Noise From The Events In The Library. The Most Disturbing Part Was When They Were Breaking Down From The Event Around 2Am. It Was Very Disturbing And Upsetting To Be Woken At 2Am By Scraping  Banging And Such. When I Had Called The Front Desk  I Was Told The Staff Is Breaking Down The Room And Setting Up For The Next Day And They Did Not Seem To Understand How Disturbing It Was To The Guests.   Overall  The Issues Were Resolved. However They Certainly Made My Stay At The Arch To Be Less Delightful And Pleasant.  ,,,,,
,805,Always A Pleasure Staying At The Arch Whenever I'm In London,,,,,
,806,I Loved The Hotel Room Service Food Best In London,,,,,
,807,I Really Appreciate Your Great Service Both On Arrival And During 3-Night-Stay.,,,,,
,808,I Recieved A Very Friendly Welcome By Staff As It Was My Birthday And Had A Room Upgrade. My Friends Really Enjoyed Their Stay Too And Are Considering Booking The Arch In The Very Near Future.,,,,,
,809,The Extra Amount Charge In The Pre Authorization Over The Daly Rate Seems Too Hight.,,,,,
,810,We Arrived After A Very Long (24 Hour) Journey  The Staff Gave Us A Warm Welcome And Were Efficient On Checkin.,,,,,
,811,When We Asked For Twin Beds As We Are Seniors They Immediately Emailed Us To Grant Our Request.  It Made For A More Restful Sleep.,,,,,
,973,Overall It Was Enjoyable.,,,,,
,975,I Would Love To See Cookies By The Coffee Table.,,,,,
,979,Everyone Was Very Courteous,,,,,
,985,Felt To Front Desk Staff Were A Little Bit Stand Off'ish,,,,,
,990,It Was A Cold Evening  Door Staff Greeted Me In Formal Coats But Would Have Been Nice To See A Badge/Scarf  To Indicate They Are Part Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,998,I Was Greeted As Soon As I Stepped Out Of The Cab And The Concierge Were Very Friendly And Welcoming. I Couldn't Have Been More Pleased.,,,,,
,999,Same As Previous Comment,,,,,
,1004,It Was Good That The Staff Had Known That We Had Stayed Before At The Hotel,,,,,
,1008,No,,,,,
,1014,Just See The Comments Concerning The Bath,,,,,
,1022,We Booked 2 Rooms  One For Friends Who Have Had A Difficult Time Recently And Their Room Was Upgraded  It Was Amazing And They Were Blown Away And Will Also Be Staying Again.,,,,,

,8,The Juniper Suite Was Stunning With The Outside Terrace.,,,,,
,13,Providing Coplimentary Soft Drinks Is Excellent  Well Done!,,,,,
,14,Beautiful Design For Rooms. Very Relaxing And Joyful Colors.  The Products In The Shower Were Very Standard And Not Impressive.,,,,,
,15,My Tv Didn't Work The Whole Time I Was There,,,,,
,16,Bathrobes A Bit Old And Torn At Some Parts,,,,,
,17,The Internet Was Too Slow,,,,,
,18,Think I Stayed In 212. The Area Below The Minibar (Where The Glasses Were Located) Was Extremely Dusty. Bathtub Had A Strong Odor Of Detergent When I Walked In. Got The Impression It Was A Rushed Clean Up Job.,,,,,
,19,The Air Con In Room 311 Was A Bit Noisy And Might Need Checking,,,,,
,20,As Previously  I Had A Problem With The Bed And Also The Lighting In Te Room Is Pretty Dim To Do Any Work.,,,,,
,24,Room 101 Water Leaking Out Of Shower Service Notification Button Kept Changing - Error In System For Turndown Service It Would Be Nice To Have A Small White Mat With The Slippers Next To The Bed,,,,,
,26,208. Not Enough Lighting. Sheets Had A Breakfast Tea Stain On Them Near Foot. Not Sure The Sheets Were Ever Changed I Was There The 7 Nights. Brilliant Malin And Goetz Toiletries Filled Up Twice A Day - Fabulous. Room Service Was Good Except One Day I Asked For Oj  Tea With Soya And No Pastires And Berries Only. What Came Was Coffee  No Oj And Pastries. The Soya Came Not Cow Milk Which Was Good. Overall Staff Are V Pleasant.,,,,,
,29,Very Small Room  Expected A Much Bigger Room When Having An Executive Room. Closet Space Was Not Enough Even Though Room Information Stated Large Space. Placement Of Full Size Mirror Was Not Good At All.,,,,,
,30,I Thought It Was Small And Overpriced.,,,,,
,34,Room Was Too Small,,,,,
,40,The First Room I Was In Had A Hole In The Wall  Which I Brought To The Attention Of The Staff. The Final Room Was Excellent But I Could Not Get The Temperature To 22C. It Was Always Either To Hot Or Cold.,,,,,
,41,It Was Very Small For And 'Upgraded' Room  But It Was Lovely,,,,,
,46,The Only Problem With Room 101 Was The Shower Door Leaking And The Do Not Disturb/Service Room Panel Unexpectedly Changing From Dnd To Service,,,,,
,47,No Remote For The Tv,,,,,
,48,Superb Quality And Comfort,,,,,
,49,I Wish That The Internet Connection Required A Password.  I Don't Feel Comfortable Using An Unsecured Network.,,,,,
,51,Loved Tv In The Bath,,,,,
,52,Our Room Was Very Nicely Appointed And We Very Much Enjoyed The Design/Interior Decor Of The Hotel And Our Room.,,,,,
,55,Room 218 Temperature Control Was Too Noisy To Keep On For Any Significant Time  Included Intermitant High-Pitched Whistling Sound.  I-Pod Docks Are Not Compatible With New (5Th) Gereration I-Pods. From Bath  One Can See Underside Of Sink Along With Its Workings  An Unsightly View In Otherwise Very Nice Bathroom,,,,,
,57,Room Service : Discrete And Professional,,,,,
,58,Ac Could Be Easier To Use  Had To Find The Right Setting Before It Worked Properly,,,,,
,59,216 Had A Wonderful Nights Sleep And Extremely Impressed With Room. Liked The Bathroom Night Light,,,,,
,60,We Were Very Kindly Given An Upgrade So The Room Hadn't Been Warmed Yet.. We Found It A Bit Tricky To Get It To Warm Up But Once We'd Got It To Work It Was Fine!,,,,,
,61,Thank You For The Upgrade!,,,,,
,63,That Was Genuinely The Most Comfortable Bed I've Slept In And I'd Love To Know What Make It Was!,,,,,
,65,The Room Was Quite Hot Even Though I Reduced The Temperature To 16 Degrees. Maybe I Did It Wrong. I Turned It Off In The End. It Was Not A Major Issue..,,,,,
,68,Table Height Not Good For Working.,,,,,
,69,Room Was Clean  But Not Exceptionally So -- Bathroom Mirror Was Not Wiped  So I Could See Finger-Printed Words On The Mirror When The Bathroom Fogged Up. Also I Didn't Finish The Plate Of Fruits During My Stay  And The Strawberry Turned Mouldy Which Made A Mess Of The Plate. Would Recommend Clearing The Fruit Plate Before They Go Bad!,,,,,
,70,I Liked The Bathroom  But There Wasn't A Water Hose Next To The Toilet Seat Unlike Other Hotels Which Are The Same Level As Arch Hotel,,,,,
,71,On Previous Stays This Year There Were A Different Brand Of Bathroon Products That Were Much Better Than Those Currently Being Used.,,,,,
,73,When You Turn On The 'Do Not Disturb/Sleeping' Button  The Red Light Is Very Intense. As It Often Visible From The Bed  It Can Disturb When You Want To Fall Asleep,,,,,
,75,Loved The Bed! The Shampoo Smelled Very Nice But Was Not The Best For My Hair. Liked The Broad Range Of Tv Channels. The Room Was Very Warm When We Arrived - Much Appreciated Given The Cold Temperatures Outside!,,,,,
,78,The Mattress Cover Needed A Wash  The Paint Was Peeling On The Bathroom Door And There Was Rust/Mold In The Corners Of The Shower. Also The Bathroom Mirror Had Been Hit On The Wall So That It Was Chipped. Not A Big Deal But These Sorts Of Details Should Be Monitored.,,,,,
,81,The Room Was Clean When We Arrived But When The Maids Came In Whilst We Were There They Didn't Do Anything To Tidy/Clean The Kitchen. Also The Fruit In Our Fruit Bowl Was Mouldy,,,,,
,86,Dvd Was On Channel 26  Not On 25 As Written,,,,,
,90,We Loved The Room  But The Bathroom (317) Could Need Some Minor Repairs. Some Damages To The Paint By The Sink  And The Small Mirror Over The Sink Had Nearly Fallen Off. The Bottom Of The Bathroom Door Was Also Missing Some Paint Probably Due To Moist From The Shower.,,,,,
,94,This Was The Most Beautiful  Comfortable  And Pleasant Hotel Room I Have Ever Stayed In For Business In London.  Thank You !,,,,,
,100,Room 509: The Television Keeps Coming On And Off  They Worked On It Twice But It Never Stoped. So I Didn't Get To Enjoy The Sky.  Also I Tried To Make Tea And On Looking Inside The Kettle I Saw A String Of Blonde Hair Inside So I Didn't Have The Courage To Make Tea Any Longer. Alos The Tea Cups Smell Like They Are Not Washed With Detergents After Use Like Its Just Rinsed Because I Saw A Tea Line In One Of The Cups. Thank You.,,,,,
,101,Everything Was Perfect  Except A Piece Of Floor Outside The Bathroom Peeled (Room 105).,,,,,
,108,Shower Didn't Drain Properly. Room 317,,,,,
,111,Personal Preference Is For A Slightly Harder Bed  So Gave A Score Of 2 Rather Than 1 - But It Was Very Comfortable Nonetheless!,,,,,
,117,Could Hear Noise/Footsteps From Upstairs Room. Needs Better Insulating.,,,,,
,119,The Inside Window Was Somehow Broken As The Upper Part Could Stay In Place And Therefore Allowed Bit Of Noise To Come From The Street. This Was Mentionned On Check Out  Hope It Helped Fixing It,,,,,
,121,The Room Was Ok  The Complementary Service With Nespresso And Skyhd Is Excellent. By The Way The Hot Water Was Off For A Day And The Electricity Went Off For More Than 4 Hours In An Evening.... Those Are Problems That Let Me Ask Myself If The Next Time I Will Visit London I Will Be Your Costumer Again. Besides These Bad Luck Events And Some Of Your Staff Unpolite Behaviors The Arch Is A Great Choice,,,,,
,124,I Am Not A Luddite But The Radio Was Impossible To Use  Seriously Unusable Due To The Complicated Set Up. And The Vcr Was Equally Frustrating To Operate. We Complained About The Lack Of Temperature Control And Despite One Attempt By The Front Desk It Never Worked Properly And The Room Was Constantly Too Hot Or Too Cold. Very Uncomfortable.,,,,,
,125,The Bathroom Was Great And The Tub With Tv Was A Nice Touch.  Though There Was A Problem With The Remote Control.,,,,,
,127,The Pillows Were Incredibly Hard And Uncomfortable. No Other Options In The Closet.,,,,,
,129,We Stayed In One Room For Four Nights  Left For A Night  Then Returned To Another Room For One Night. The First Room For Four Nights We Had No Trouble With Air Temperature. The Second Room For The One Night (502) The Air Conditioning And Fan Did Not Work  They Would Turn On For A Minute Then Turn Off. We Did Not Sleep Well That Night. We Mentioned This On Check Out And They Asked If We Had Called Down  Which We Did Not Since It Was Middle Of The Night And We Were Just Trying To Sleep. Also  The Beds Were Very Comfortable  But The One In 505 Has A Big Lump In The Middle Which Made It Difficult To Sleep Close To My Partner. It Was Still Quite Comfortable.,,,,,
,130,306 It Is A Bit Small For A Superior Room  But Has A Very Warm And Lovely Decor.  The Bath Is Really Fantastic And Perfect For A Soak After A Long Day.,,,,,
,131,The Matelais Was Excellent,,,,,
,132,007; I Am Surprised That Is Approved By A Fire Inpection. The Doors To The Room Are All Alike. (Hall Way Doors And Room Doors) It Would Help I Guess To Give The Hallway Doors A Different Colour/Type Of Wood. If There Is A Fire Ont He Stairs Towards The Room We Are Trapped. Window Can Not Open. The Noise From Above Is Abnormal. Instead Of Not Having Guests Running Round The Hallway Noisyly  We Had Stumble Noise From Above And Undifined Areas. It Is One Of The Reasons To Maybe Not Come Back.,,,,,
,136,No Powerpoint In The Bathroom For The Hairdryer  Only For A Shaver? Also Are Extractor Fans Not Used In Bathrooms In The Uk? Bathroom Got Very Foggy And Hot After A Shower And Made It Hard To Stay In There.,,,,,
,145,Bed Side Phone Needed To Be Clean.,,,,,
,146,The Medrace Of The Bed In Room 217 Was Kind Of Worn Down. A New And Harder Medrace Would Be Much Better!,,,,,
,160,Very Nice Decor In The Style Of The Rest Of The Hotel,,,,,
,161,I Booked Through Tablethotels And Was Assigned A Room That Was Basement Level Upon Arrival. Given That I Was Held In London Unable To Return To Nyc Due To The Hurricane And Was Anxious About Things Back Home  I Found This To Be Quite Depressing  So I Called The Front Desk And Asked To Move To Brighter Surroundings. My Request Was Graciously Obliged  Although I Did Have To Pay A Fair Bit More. So That Episode Did Set Things Off To A Bit Of A Bad Start.,,,,,
,162,Neither The Room Or The Bathroom Bin Had Been Emptied Prior To Our Arrival.,,,,,
,180,Noticed On Several Visits Now  The Place Is Pretty Immaculate  Bathroom Bottom Of The Shower Door  The Seals Are All Black Seen It On My Last Three Visits  I'm Not Picky I'm Sure It Leaves A Door Open For Others To Moan,,,,,
,184,The Bed War Terrible  You Can See The Waves Formed By The Previous People That Slept In It...,,,,,
,186,Changing Temperatures Caused A Whining Noise In 218,,,,,
,192,I Do Not Believe The Room We Had  Room 005  Should Be Used At All  Especially Regarding The Price And Being In The 'Deluxe' Category. I Am Sure The Other Rooms Are Better And That Room With That Tiny Window Is Not Worthy Your Hotel.,,,,,
,193,The Lights Were Rather Dim  Especially Near Mirrors (Hard To Put On Makeup Or Fix Hair). Also  Would Have Enjoyed A Lighter Layer - Like A Sheet - On The Bed. The Duvet  Whilst Comfortable Was Quite Warm.,,,,,
,198,Two Times Now The Toilet Was Not Very Well Cleaned. The Hotel Overall Is Too Heated - Too Warm,,,,,
,199,The Room Was Nice Once I Was Switched By The Manager  As Explained In My Previous Comment.,,,,,
,201,Again When Needing A Password To Use Some Channels  Why Not Simply Note On The Remote The Code 0000? Again When Calling Front Desk  They Did Not Know And Send A Technician. At Least Inform Front Desk Personal,,,,,
,202,The Beds Are So Soft That It Is Unbearable To Sleep On In Some Of Your Rooms. The Air Conditioning Was Not Working During My Last Stay - Kept Shutting Off Even Though My Window Was Closed.,,,,,
,204,Madras Was Broken So I Injured My Foot As A Consequence And Put Some Blood On My Socks And Your Sheets.   Sky Box Not Working Properly But Tv In Bathroom Worked Fine. Just Annoying Having To See Tv There,,,,,
,206,206 Too Small  Too Noisy And Too Hot. Unable To Have Air Con On Due To Increased Noise So 3 Nights Of Broken Sleep. Asked To Change Room But Nothing Was Available,,,,,
,207,Very Comfortable Bed-All Very Clean And Very Well Maintained. Beautiful Room.,,,,,
,209,Internet Perfect,,,,,
,210,Fab,,,,,
,216,Our Rooms  201 & 202  Were Called 'Connecting' In Our Booking With Slh & In Our Phone/Email Exchanges Directly With The Hotel  But They Were Not Actually Connecting. The Hotel Should Be Honest With The Description - The Rooms Are Facing Each Other & Have A Lockable Common Outer Door  But They Are Not Connected. This Is Not The Same When You Have A Small Child Sleeping In The Other Room On His Own.,,,,,
,218,Full Length Mirror Inside The Wardrobe - Could Not Open Door Fully Due To Bed In The Way,,,,,
,221,Very Cozy,,,,,
,223,The Maid Service On Saturday Came Very Late 5Pm  Not An Issue But Would Have Preferred To Return To The Room Attended To.,,,,,
,224,There Was A Hair Left On The Television In The Bathroom And We Unplugged The Sky Hd Box Overnight As The Hard Drive Was Whirring Away  But Very Small Niggles!,,,,,
,225,A Couple Of Time It Seem That Someone Was In The Room Because They Left A Key Card As If They Forgot About It  Maybe The Were Planning To Come Back  But The Room Was Not Done.  I Did Bring This To The Staff Attention And They Took Care Of This Immediately.,,,,,
,226,Bathroom Products Were Designed For Men.,,,,,
,229,Bed Was Not Comfortable And Sky Tv Was Not Easy To Turn On/Off.,,,,,
,230,106  I Booked A Deluxe Room With The Travel Agent.  Mainly Due To The Size Being Minimum Of 25Sqm.  The Room I Stayed In Felt Smaller Than That.  When I Queried This  I Was Told The Next Room Up Was The Suite.  This Seems A Bit Contradicting To Your Website.  Bit Confusing!?,,,,,
,231,My Sky Tv Did Not Work And A Workman Had To Be Called To Install A New Box. The Room Temp Was Set To Extremely Cold (16 Degrees!) And It Wasnt Obvious How To Turn From Chilling To Heating  Again Someone Had To Come Up To Assist.,,,,,
,239,The Water Temperature In The Shower Fluctuated,,,,,
,240,205- The Bed Was Far Too Comfortable...In A Positive Way...As Once We Arrived We Ended Up Having An Afternoon Nap!!!!,,,,,
,242,Too Bad There Was No Bathtub !,,,,,
,243,Lovely Room,,,,,
,245,Lovely Treat Sitting In Heated Courtyard - Sullivan,,,,,
,248,Sky Was Not Working  However It Was Eventually Sorted Out.,,,,,
,249,Rm 501 - The Telephone Speaker Option Didn't Seem To Work And There Were Also No Directions On How To Get An Outside Line... Had To Call The Operator / Front Desk For That,,,,,
,250,No,,,,,
,501,Room 505. I Thought That The Lighting In The Desk/Closet  Area Could Have Been Brighter. Overhead And Desk Lamp Were Insufficient Especially As We Used This Area For Dressing. Perhaps A Dimmer Switch For That Space?,,,,,
,503,Better Products Emergency,,,,,
,504,118 Although The Bathroom Products Were Of Good Quality There Was Only 1 Of Each Products And These Did Not Seem Full  Certainly Not Enough For 2 People  There Was Also No Bubble Bath - Can't Have A Bath Without It. Also No Cotton Wool Pads. All Seemed Rather Stingy. The First Night No Water Was Provided Either,,,,,
,515,Just Love Staying At Your Hotel  Just Right For Me Thank You,,,,,
,517,Bed Is Good  Pillows A Little Soft. The Internet Could Be Faster?,,,,,
,518,At Times When Watching Tv It Requested To Enter A Pin Number. This Was Annoying At Times And Happened Mostly On Sky Movie Channels.,,,,,
,519,A Bit More Light In The Bathroom Would Be Helpful!,,,,,
,520,I Forgot My Suite Number. I Like The Room  But It Was Quite Small.,,,,,
,521,It Was Noisy.  There Was A Low Banging Sound Throughout The Night  Like The Sound Of Shutters Slamming.  It Seemed To Come From The Adjacent Room Immediately Behind Our Bed.,,,,,
,524,Room 011: Excellent Room  Except For Noise When Somebody Passed In The Corridor Outside (Especially Disturbing Early Morning),,,,,
,526,Could Not Open The Closet Doors Completely Because Of The Bed. The Telephone System Is Awful And Very Annoying,,,,,
,529,Shortage Of Hangers By Rectified As Soon As Raised With Staff,,,,,
,535,Closet And Bathroom Were Great And Liked The Spacious Foyer Into Our Room But The Bedroom Felt Small And Confining.,,,,,
,539,I Did Not Like To Be Put Into A Room In The Basement  Without Knowing This In Advance. I Would Not Have Booked The Hotel  If I Would Have Known That My Room Will Be In The Basement  Even Though The Hotel Is Very Nice.,,,,,
,540,Tv Remote Did Not Turn On,,,,,
,555,Room 510 The Air Conditioning Was Not Working But Having Contacted Reception This Was Rectified.,,,,,
,559,Room #306: We Were Not Able To Get An Upgrade During This Stay  But Perhaps In Our Next Stay. The Room  However  Was Lovely And The Bathroom Was Excellent. The Soft Drinks And Water That Was Accessible Through The In-Room Refrigerator Was A Lovely Touch --Very Helpful!,,,,,
,562,T.V Was Fine  Found Radio Difficult,,,,,
,565,Tubs Do Not Drain The Water Whilst Taking A Shower,,,,,
,566,Brighter Bathroom Lighting.  Not Certain Whether Largest Ceiling Fixture Was Light Not Functioning Or Not But Need Option Of Counter Area/Sink Brightness,,,,,
,567,If Was A Bit Hard To Switch On The Tv At The Bed As Well The Extra Bed Needed An Extra Mattress.,,,,,
,569,The Free Internet Is Huge - Absolutely Fantastic.  I Hate Paying 20Gbp For Internet And It's One Of The Reason I Switched To Your Hotel.  The Bathrooms Are Well Appointed And Although I Don't Take Advantage Of It  I Like That Most Of The Items In The Mini Bar Are Free.  Brilliant.  High Marks For The Coffee Maker As Well.  Using Your Ipod With The Radio Is A Bit Confusing  But That Is Trivial.,,,,,
,573,When I Was Watching The Tv The Station Kept On Freezing So I Could Not Watch My Preferred Chanel,,,,,
,576,Bed A Little To Soft...But Otherwise All Good!,,,,,
,577,I Really Do Look Forward To Your Bed :-) And Live Having The Coffee Machine,,,,,
,584,The Beds Are To Soft But Pillows To Firm But The Staff Change The Pillows So Not A Real Issue,,,,,
,592,Stayed In The Juniper Suite. A Perfect Room For My Staying! Loved The Little Outside Spot. Some Green Plants Where Would Do It Even More Attractive.,,,,,
,594,Pillow Was A Little Lumpy/Hard. Would Be Good To Have A Firm And A Softer Pillow Instead Of Two Firm Pillows,,,,,
,598,We Mentioned To The Staff When We Left That The Shower Screen Leaked I Was Not Able To Get The Bath Cushion To Stick - The Bath Was Too Long For Me!,,,,,
,599,We Did Have A Few Issues With The Air Conditioning Cutting Out  But On Both Occasions It Was Repaired Immediately.,,,,,
,613,There Was Too Much Noise From The Bathroom Near Us. We Heard The Shower At Every Time It Was In Use.,,,,,
,614,I Wish Hotels Would Not Us Only Comforters. It Gets Much Too Hot In The Room At Night And The Comforter Is Much Too Warm  But Then There Is Not Choice. A Sheet And Then A Blanket In The Cubbord Is Better.,,,,,
,617,Room 110 The Shower Fitting Wasnt Working. It Was Partially Detached Form The Wall. We Didnt Expect This In A  Luxury Hotel. The Fridge Light In The Lobby Was Very Bright And Impossible To Extinguish At Night. It Was Extremely Irritating As It Interfered With My Sleep,,,,,
,620,I Would Like Less Furniture And A Bigger Bed,,,,,
,626,Wasnt Able To Use Tv In Bathroom Easily,,,,,
,628,The Sheets Were Very Good!,,,,,
,630,117 The Total Frosting Of All The Windows Is A Bit Claustrophobic - Would Have Been Nice To See The Sky At Least Even If It Was Grey.,,,,,
,632,Room 117 Is Too Small And Has Poor Views/Light For A Longer Stay Corporate Guest.,,,,,
,633,305 - A Lovely Room! Thank You.,,,,,
,638,3Rd Floor.  Room Was Small For 2.,,,,,
,639,Loved The Long Bech Space In The Bathroom- Ideal For All The Cosmetics!,,,,,
,644,Pleasant,,,,,
,654,Would Like To See Some Other Rooms Within The Hotel,,,,,
,655,One Day  The Cleaning Lady Were Cleaning The Room Before We Had Pressed The Green Button.  We Had To Wait To Use The Bathroom After Breakfast Untill She Had Finished And This Was A Little  Uncomfortable For Us.   But This Is Just A Little 'Thing' Compared To All The Good Service We Had At Your Hotell.  We Really Enjoyed Our Stay.  We Did Not Work In The Room  Therefor I Have Not Ticket Out An Answer Here.,,,,,
,656,Didn't Have A Reservation At The Arch - We Hosted A Private Dinner Function In The Whitehall Room.,,,,,
,660,Just To Repeat That We Found The Bed Mattress Uncomfortable  But Again The Couple We Were Traveling With Thought It Was Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,662,Keep Air On. When We Would Return To The Room From A Long Day It Took Some Time To Cool It Again.,,,,,
,664,Room Temperature Was Set Too High When We Arrived  And Freezing Second Night - Not Good,,,,,
,666,I Find Getting The Radios To Work A Bit Fiddly...,,,,,
,667,I Used The Disabled Room Which Was Excellent. My Only Suggestion Is That Although The Toilet Had Rails Around It A Higher Toliet Seat Would Have Been Helpful,,,,,
,668,Room 008.  Very Good,,,,,
,669,No,,,,,
,670,Was Perfect In Every Way - No Complaints.,,,,,
,672,Loved The Nespresso Pixie And Tea Service,,,,,
,674,Room 508  The Room Was Perfect Extremely Comfortable With A Very Warm Decor.,,,,,
,675,It Was All Very Good,,,,,
,676,Loved The Decor. Bathroom Was Well Designed; Appreciated The Heated Towel Rack. The Nespresso Machine And Tea Were Much Appreciated. Loved The Peace And Quiet Surroundings Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,677,Didn't Use The Radio So Cannot Comment On That Question,,,,,
,678,We Were Impressed With The Cleanliness And Organization Of The Room.  The Maid Who Serviced Us Did An Excellent Job.  We Were Also Delighted To Have The 'Turn Down' Service  Which Is Something That Many Hotels No Longer Offer.  The Hair And Body Products Were Also Outstanding!  (In Fact  We Went Out In Search Of Them And Purchased Several More Bottles To Take Home.  We Would Recommend Selling Them At The Hotel  If Possible.),,,,,
,681,Quiet And Comfortable,,,,,
,684,The Bed In Room 315 Was Extremely Soft  And It Dipped In The Middle. After Three Uncomfortable Nights  It Finally Occurred To Us To Request A Bed Board. It Helped A Lot  But The Beds Should Be Firmer.,,,,,
,685,#217. The Reading Lights By The Bed Are A Brilliant Touch. Tv And Radio Are Great But Difficult To Use For Technophobes. However  Help Came Immediately When Called. Carlton Is A Gem. Nespresso Is Much Appreciated. More Desk Lighting Would Have Been Useful.,,,,,
,687,The Bedroom Was A Bit On The Small Side.,,,,,
,690,Room 115 The Room Was Very Pleasant Indeed. The Only Issue My Wife And I Had  And The Same Was True In The Library  Was With The Lighting Which Was Sometimes Too Subdued. If It Was Possible To Adjust  The Controls Weren't Obvious.,,,,,
,695,There Was No Heating In The Bathroom An We Were Freezing Each Time We Used It. In Fact My Wife Caught A Severe Cold During Our Stay. Plus  The Aircondition In The Room Got Out Of Order Too And We Recieved A Portable One.,,,,,
,701,I Stayed In 510. I Thought For A Deluxe Room  It Was A Bit Small.,,,,,
,704,Still Need Better/Firmer Pillows,,,,,
,708,Very Cozy Room With All The Right Touches.The Bed Was Very Comfortable For One Person.,,,,,
,711,A Little Bit Too Technical In Respect Of The Controls,,,,,
,714,Room 109 - Very Pleased With My Stay - Just One Small Criticism  On The Day We Were Leaving There Was No Hot Water To Have A Shower With So Had To Make Do With Tepid Water!  When I Mentioned This At Reception I Was Told That It Was A Busy Time Of Day And There Was A Lot Of Demand For Hot Water But I Didn't Think This Was A Suitable Answer.,,,,,
,716,The Standard Room And The Bed Are Good For One Person But A Little Too Small For Two.,,,,,
,719,We Stayed In Room 116  The Shower Screen And Bath Edging Looked Like It Needed Some Attention  As It Was Black In Places. This Did Not Detract From The Overall Condition Of The Bathroom  That We Found To Be Good.,,,,,
,727,The Bed Was Not Comfortable Based On The 2 Separate Beds Vs A King Solid Bed. Room 114,,,,,
,728,Some Issues To Get Access To Tv Sky. Required Assistance From Desk During Our Stay. Was Not Able To Access Mid-Week. It Was Fixed  But Not Clear What Had Happened.,,,,,
,731,Room 510  The Room Was Generally Clean But The Carpet Needs To Be Cleaned.,,,,,
,733,Best Shower Of Any Hotel I've Stayed In Anywhere In The World.  Don't Change It!,,,,,
,734,Only On One Occasion Did The Teapot Remain Uncleaned Following Use.,,,,,
,736,Excelent!!!!,,,,,
,738,Bathroom Was Too Hot And I Coulnd't Turn The Heat Down.,,,,,
,740,The Sky Tv  Was Not Intuitive (We Do Not Have One At Home) But The Instructions Were To Hand.,,,,,
,745,My Room Was Very Hot And Uncomfortable I Was Therefore Unable To Sleep Or Work In Theroom,,,,,
,746,We Did Not Use The Radio. The Internet Was A Pain To Use. We Ended Up Using My Mobile To Connect Our Computer To The Internet.,,,,,
,748,Coffee Machine Remains A Mystery,,,,,
,750,504- Loved Having Fresh Towels In The Room Every Time We Came Back To The Hotel. Also  The A-C Worked Great. We Are From The South In The U.S. And Use To A Cold Room To Sleep. Other Hotels In Italy And France Were Always Too Hot.,,,,,
,751,Loved Room 302 A Bit More Room For Our Suitcase!  Other Delux A Bit Small,,,,,
,752,Unusually My Wife Received An Adverse Reaction To The Use Of The Shower Gel As A Result Was Covered In A Rash - Only Developed On The Saturday - Red Rash And Continuous Itching - Eased By Monday,,,,,
,754,Radio Is Difficult To Work.,,,,,
,755,Had A Problem With Air Conditioner The 1St Night  But It Was Fixed For Us Promply.,,,,,
,756,Our Room Had A Wall-To-Wall Carpet. I See On The Photos That Some Guest Rooms (Only Suites?) Have Wooden Floors. Considering The General Standard Of The Hotel And The Price  I Think You Should Have Invested In Wooden Floors In Guest Rooms. That Is More Hygienic  And Better For People With Moderate Allergies. In Norway Most New Hotels Have Wooden Floors In The Guest Rooms.  I Was Not Able To Use The Internet Radio And The Television In The Bathroom. But Then I Didn't Ask For Help...,,,,,
,759,The Room Was A Little Small For The Price We Paid  And Somewhat Cramped With All The Furniture  But Well Equipped Nonetheless.,,,,,
,760,14.    Difficulty With Tv Remote..Had To Have Someone Come Twice..Staff Came Quickly And Fixed Problem. Instructions Given For Operating Thermostat Did Not Appear To Work Well..Constantly Having To Adjust It Hair Dryer Only Works At Bedroom Desk And Lighting Very Poor So Cannot See What You Are Doing.,,,,,
,764,511 Lovely Room,,,,,
,767,Tv In Bathroom Was Locked But The Engineer Appeared To Correct It Within 5 Minutes Of The Call. However The Towel Rail Was Cold And Could Not Be Corrected So The Staff Offered A Change Of Room Which We Declined.,,,,,
,768,I Was A Fleet Street Editor For Many Years And Have Stayed In Many Of The Best Hotels In London Over The Past 25 Years. My Wife  Janetta  And I Both Agreed That The Arch Was One Of The Finest Hotels We Have Ever Stayed In. The Staff Were Friendly And Efficient. The Hotel Is Very Comfortable And Welcoming. The Food Was Outstanding And The Bar Has A Good Atmosphere  Although I Prefer Bars You Can Lean On. I'm More Of A Traditionalist Where Hotels Are Concerned But I Have To Say That The Hotel Combines Comfort  Homeliness With A Very Relaxed  Attractive And Distinctive Style. My Wife And I Couldn't Fault It In Any Way And Are Pleased To Praise It In Every Way. As A Magazine Publisher And Editor-In-Chief Of Our Magazines I Will Take Every Opportunity To Promote The Excellence Of The Arch.,,,,,
,771,Room 319 The Coffe Machine Is Always A Mystery But We Did Get In Too Work. Had To Ask For Water. No Complimentary Chocolates This Time. Glass Top On Side Table Slides Around,,,,,
,772,Video Didn't Work  At Least Not For Me!,,,,,
,773,Suite 16.  Beautiful Room With Expansive Bathroom.  Best Rain Shower Ever!  Only Issue For Us That It Was Not As Bright A Room As We Like And There Was Some Street Noise At Night--Being On The Ground Floor.,,,,,
,774,Would Liked Lighter Bedding As It Got A Bit Warm With The Heavy Quilt,,,,,
,775,Room 209 It Seemed Cold Over By The Window But It Was Exceptionally Cold Outside Across 22 To 25 Feb! Although We Cannot Be 100% Sure  We Believe We Indicated 'Turndown' With New Water Etc On Sat 23 But This Was Not Done.,,,,,
,777,The First Room We Stayed Was Close To The Library And Was A Bit Noisy During The Night,,,,,
,779,Room 011. My Room Was Noisy And Was Changed The Following Day With Courtesy.,,,,,
,782,312 Two Suggestions:Bath Foam.A Smaller (Queen Size) Bad Will Make The Room Bigger ..,,,,,
,784,The Room Was Very Clean And Comfy.  There Was Only One Place Not As Clean  The Corner Of The Shower/ Bath Has Molds.,,,,,
,787,The Inside Bed Sheet Was Not Well Done After The One Night... Was All Crinkled :(,,,,,
,791,R.:302 Aircon Duct Pointed At One Side Of Bed  To Keep Ambient Temp Down  One Person Had To 'Suffer',,,,,
,797,We Had Two Issues Relating To The Safe Which On Our Last Day Caused Us Delay. The First Issue Should Have Been Addressed More Thoroughly,,,,,
,802,The Mattress Was Really Excellent!,,,,,
,803,The Room I Stayed In Had Very Spotty Cel Service Which Meant That I Had To Make All My Phone Calls From A Very Specific Location In The Room. Being That My Visit Was For Business Reasons  This Was Somewhat Inconvenient.  The Temp Control System Seemed Finicky - A Degree Change Seemed To Make The Room Either Too Hot Or Too Cold!,,,,,
,807,Regarding Tv  It Was A Bit Hard To Find How To Use.,,,,,
,810,One Of The Most  If Not The Most  Comfortable Hotel Beds I Have Slept In For A Long Time  It Was Tough Getting Out Of Bed In The Mornings!  Very Quick Internet Access  We Had No Trouble With Interruptions With The Internet  Unlike Our Experience In Some Other Hotels.,,,,,
,814,Room Was A Bit Smaller Than I Expected.,,,,,
,817,Beautiful Room.  See Previous Comments.,,,,,
,825,Our Bed Was Very Uncomfortable  It Was Uneven From Toe To Head Which Affected Your Sleep Quality. But That Will Be The Reason For Me To Look For Another Hotel.,,,,,
,830,The Pillows Were Not Comfortable - Even With A Change. Lovely Coffee And Tea In The Room.,,,,,
,832,Sky Didn't Have Enough Movie/ Entertainment Channels,,,,,
,970,It Was Not Easy To Find The Hairdryer  I Was Not Able To Find A German Tv Program  But Overall Easy To Turn On Sky Tv,,,,,
,972,103 (I Believe).  Room Size Was A Litle Tight.,,,,,
,973,A Little Too Small But Comfortable.   I Personally Prefer A Little Bigger Sitting Area.,,,,,
,976,Bed Was Extremly Comfy,,,,,
,979,304  Quality Throughout. Lovely Decor And Very Comfortable,,,,,
,982,Like That I Could Open Window,,,,,
,983,The Mattress Was A Bit Uncomfortable And My Wife Found She Was Rolling Towards The Center Where There Was A Depression In It.,,,,,
,985,Better Toilet Paper Would Be Nice,,,,,
,990,The Room Was A Little Smaller Than I Was Used To And I Normally Prefer To Be Away From The Lifts Due To Noise. ,,,,,
,991,Unfortunately You Don't Supply French And Italian Tv Channels,,,,,
,998,On Two Occasions  Housekeeping Had Not Fully Closed The Minibar Fridge - Not A Big Deal And Easily Done But The Back Of The Fridge Did Start Dripping Later In The Night Which Frightened Me Initially But A Quick Mop Up And It Did Not Persist.,,,,,
,999,Everything Still Looks New  Which For Me Is Important In Choosing A Room,,,,,
,1002,Television Had A Habit Of Switching On And Off When Using Sky Remote.
Sky Plus Was Available But Unable To Record At All,,,,,
,1007,Few Months Ago We Were Very Satisfied With Our Room Room 309. This Stay We Had The Room 514 Witch Is Smaller And Less Confortable. Next Time We Would Like To Have The Room 309 Again  Hopefully!,,,,,
,1008,My Bedroom Was O Too Cold O Too Warm,,,,,
,1009,Room 308 Bedroom Was Too Hot The As The Air Con Didn't Work Properly So We Had To Open The Windows Which Weren't Very Easy .  It Was Then Very Noisy With Street Noise And Traffic.,,,,,
,1014,A Little Bit Noisy Due To Th Floor The Difficulty For The Water To Pass In The Bath.,,,,,
,1018,Bedroom Was A Little On The Small Side And It Is Impossible To Do Any Work In There As The Desk Is Just Too Small. I Asked The Reception To Let Me Use The Club Lounge One Evening Which After A Little Persuasion They Let Me Do Without Charge.,,,,,
,1020,The Room 203 Is Too Small For Three People.,,,,,

,----------------------,,,,,,
,1,Very Nice Food  Where The Selection Was Consistent With The Majority Of Your Brasserie Menu.,,,,,
,6,The Host Was Awful. We Came In For Dinner At Around 7:45. There Were Several Open Tables  Yet He Told Us There Wasn't Any Room For Us To Eat. He Told Us To Sit At A Table In The Salon And Wait For A Table To Open Up. We Ordered Drinks In The Salon And It Took Him 20 Minutes To Bring Them Over. He Did Not Seat Us At A Table In The Dining Room For Another 30 Minutes. We Waited 50 Minutes For A Table When We Were Already Sitting At A Table! The Food Was Great  The Waiters Were Nice  But The Host Was One Of The Worst I've Ever Had In My Life.,,,,,
,16,Service A Bit Chaotic And Slow,,,,,
,19,The Room Service Took Almost 45 Min. To Arrive Even Though We Got Told Upon Ordering That It Will Be Max. 20 Minutes. When The Food Arrived It Was Cold Which Was A Bit Of A Shame. We Would Have Gone Straight To Bed If We Would Have Been Told That It Will Be Almost 45 Min For The Food To Arrive As We Ordered Rs After A Night Out.....,,,,,
,21,On Booking The Hotel  Your Reservations Team Sent Us The Set Menu Dining Option. Straight Away  We Booked A Table For 7:45Pm And Specifically Asked If We Could Choose Between The Set Menu And The A La Carte Menu On The Night Or If We Had To Do It In Advance. We Had An Email Back From Anita Janstone Saying We Could Choose On The Night. When We Asked For The Set Menu We Were First Told It Was Only Available To Top Table Guests (Which Is Not Very Professional When We Were Paying 250+ For The Room). We Asked Again And Were Then Told It Was Only Available For Dining Before 7Pm. In The End I Had To Actually Find The Email Correspondence From Anita On My Ipad And Show It To Your Team Before Anyone Believed Me And We Were Very Reluctantly And Begrudgingly Given The Set Menu. This Situation Was Handled Badly As It Should Have Been Recorded On Our Booking  And Even If Not  It Should Have Been A 'Customer Is Right' Scenario And They Should Have Given Me The Benefit Of The Doubt When I Said We Had Been Offered It. We Should Have Graciously Been Given The Set Menu  Rather Than Forced To Look Up The Email Correspondence To Prove The Point.  I Was Made To Feel Like I Had Lied Or Made It Up  When In Actual Fact It Had Been Specifically Offered To Me At The Time Of Booking. The Rest Of Evening Went Well  And In Fact The Rest Of The Service Was Also Very Good And The Food Was Excellent - But I Had To Rate The Service Poor On The Basis Of This Experience As If You Are Going To Have A Set Menu At All In The Restaurant  You Need To Ensure That Guests Who Choose It Are Not Made To Feel Inferior To Those Paying For A La Carte.   ,,,,,
,24,Maybe A Nice Promotional Flyer In The Room With A Special Offer For Inhouse Guests  Like Dine In The Hotel Restaurant And Save 25% As An Inhouse Guest.,,,,,
,32,Whilst We Very Much Enjoyed Our Stay  We Felt That The Level Of Service At Breakfast Time Was Lacking. As It Was My Birthday On Our Last Day Both My Husband And I Were Looking Forward To A Leisurely Breakfast  Sadly For Us It Ended Up Being Stressful Having To Ask Several Times For Tea And Toast And Then Wrong Cooked To Order Breakfast Being Given. Overall It Felt Like More Attention Was Being Payed To Businessmen Having Their Breakfast Meetings And Hotel Guests Being Ignored. Not The 5 Star Experience We Hoped For.,,,,,
,36,Unfortunately That Night My Partner Vomited  And I Was Very Unwell With An Upset Stomach The Next Day. We Do Not Know If It Was The Food But The Timing Seemed To Indicate That.,,,,,
,40,The Wait Staff Have Always Been Excellent.,,,,,
,41,We Love That The Bar Is Open Late  And The Staff Works Very Hard To Accomodate Special Requests.,,,,,
,42,I Loved The Pizza But I Would Suggest One Or Two More Items On The Menu And 1 Or 2 More Suited For A Vegetarian,,,,,
,46,Scores Above Reflect The Bar And Drinks As Opposed To Food Which We Did Not Have Time To Sample.,,,,,
,48,Excellent Staff,,,,,
,52,The Bar Menu Was Interesting And We Very Much Enjoyed Our Cocktails.  The Quality Of The Food At Our Diner Was Very Good As Well.,,,,,
,54,Great Burger.,,,,,
,62,The Food Could Have Been Warmer.,,,,,
,65,The Young Lady That Serves Us At Dinner Did Not Really Know The Menu Well. I Asked Her About The Steak Choices And She Simply Read The Menu Description To Me. Her Colleague Was Able To Explain So There Was No Real Issue.,,,,,
,81,One Of The Waitresses At Breakfast Was Quite Slow And Didn't Seem Too Fussed About Keeping People Waiting. She Didn't Seem As Busy As The Others As She Was Happily Telling Us That She's Studying Events Management. The Menu Was A Little Incoherent  There Was Foie Gras Terrine To Start And Then Fish And Chips For Main. Having Said That The Food  Cocktails  Evening Staff And Atmosphere Were Lovely,,,,,
,90,Ver Nice Hotel Restaurant  But A Bit To Loud Music In The Background,,,,,
,94,Excellent.,,,,,
,100,Like I Said In My Comments Earlier  The Staffs Who Serve The Room Service Foods Are Far From Being Polite Or Friendly.  Also I Believe The Menu Should Consider You Have Customers From All Parts Of The World Who Would Like To Take Something Different Like Chicken Curry With Rice  It Could Be Biryani Or Any Masala Dish For  Indians  Fried Rice For Those Who Love Chinese Food    Etc Carry Out A Research Considering Your Customers. And Lots More Chicken Dishes. Thank You,,,,,
,104,Very Nice Waiters And Good Diversified Music !,,,,,
,117,Only Ordered Drinks,,,,,
,125,Expensive  But Not Ridiculous.,,,,,
,128,Let Down By Staff And Service - Would Not Eat At The Brasserie If Staying Again,,,,,
,130,The Phone Should List The Room Service Direct Extension.  The Morning Order Takers Often Dont Seem To Understand Exactly What You Want And It Can Take A Bit Long For Breakfast.,,,,,
,131,No,,,,,
,135,They Messed Up My Order One Day But The People At The Front Desk Made Accommodations For Me To Rectify The Situation.,,,,,
,139,I Had Both Dinner And Afternoon Tea During My Stay. Whilst I Was Pleased With My Meal In The Evening  Both My Guest And I Were Very Disappointed With The Afternoon Tea - We Felt It Did Not Represent Value For Money At All. We Have Both Had Afternoon Teas Elsewhere In London That Were Far Better Value Money....And We Didn't Get Offered Any Tea!,,,,,
,143,The Young Lady Who Brought Up My Food (And Also Works In The Restaurant) Was Outstanding.  Prompt  Very Friendly And Accommodating.,,,,,
,157,Late A Night (Midnight)  It Took A Long Time For Our Call For Room Service To Be Answered,,,,,
,177,I Think We Were Unfortunate On Being There On A Quiet Friday Evening  It Lacked Atmosphere A Little.,,,,,
,182,Two Points: 1) Don't Say That You Don't Believe In Charging For Breakfast To Be Delivered  Then Add A Delivery Charge To The Evening Meal - Be Consistent 2) Adding An 'Optional' Service Charge By Default Is Simply Sneaky And Underhand,,,,,
,194,Breakfast Wasn't Exactly The Same. On The Second Day  I Was Surprise Not Having Toasts (But I Had Butter...),,,,,
,199,It Often Took Quite A While For The Server To Come Over After Being Seated (At Breakfast).,,,,,
,201,Apriciated The Complementary Morning Coffee. Bar Was Greatly Serviced And Cocktails Were Fantastic,,,,,
,207,Very Nice Food Very Well Presented And Staff Very Attentive. Paloma (Lady From Spain) Excellent Service And Made Me Feel Very Welcome As I Was Dining Alone. Very Efficient.,,,,,
,208,Great Cocktails - Unique Mixes.,,,,,
,211,You Could Probably Have A Wider Range Of Options In The Menu.,,,,,
,216,The Food Quality Is Excellent  But They Mixed Up Our Order One Night.,,,,,
,220,Room Service French Fries Were Lukewarm. It Didn't Bother Me But I Imagine Other Guests Might Not Be As Satisfied. Otherwise  I Was Impressed With How Fast My Meal Arrived.,,,,,
,223,Delivered What I Order. Forgot The Butter And Jam On One Morning. However A Quick Phone Call And They Arrived,,,,,
,224,We Only Had Breakfast,,,,,
,233,I Only Ordered A Sandwich So Can't Really Comment On The Temperature :-),,,,,
,235,More Extensive Menu And Fries With Club Sandwich Would Be Better Then Crisps.,,,,,
,239,One Could Tell From Overheard Staff Discussions That Service Protocol Was Still Being Worked Out.  Nonetheless  Very Friendly And Professional Service.,,,,,
,240,Arrived Exactly On Time  Very Friendly  And Most Importantly The Food Was Fantastic.,,,,,
,245,Very Accommodating   Even Off Menu,,,,,
,249,Fabulous Breakfast And The Canapes During Cocktail Hour Were Excellent!,,,,,
,503,Better Snack Menu,,,,,
,511,Overpriced For Quality And Service. Service Extremely Amateur If Friendly. If You Charge Top Price You Have To Deliver Top Quality And Service. I've Eaten There Many Times And Always The Same. Real Weakness In The Hotel. The Food Is Ok  Rarely Excellent  But Sometimes Good With Very Good Quality Ingredients (Love The Bread.) But Service Is Not Confident  Experienced Or Anticipating Customer Needs As Really Good Service Does. Why Don't You Hire People With Some Experience? The Last Time I Was There I Was Charged For A Glass Of Champagne To Replace One That Was Spilled. I've Never Been Charged In That Way Before In A Hotel. It Was Obvious The Server Wasn't Sure What To Do And Didn't Choose The Gracious Option. I Was With A Guest So Didn't Say Anything. That Is Inexperienced Service. Many Other Examples  But I Almost Always Have To Send Something Back  Ask For Something  Point Out The Problem And Then Have To Fix A Fiddly Thing Like The Salt Shaker (Which Is Filled With Kosher Salt Too Large For It And The Server Doesn't Have The Nonce To Find A Solution.) It's Really Work To Eat There And Train Your Staff At The Same Time  (Assuming Some Of It Sticks.) Why Am I Telling The Server The Basics Only To Be Met With A Blank Stare? Little Things Add Up To Send Me To Another Restaurant Rather Than The Convenient One As I've Come To Dread Going Through The Same Pantomime Every Time I Eat There. Thanks For Asking.  ,,,,,
,512,Very Friendly Staff - We Also Had Our Youngest Son With Us And The Warmth In The Reception Of Him Also Made An Impression On Us.,,,,,
,513,Breakfast Was Great Diner Less Good,,,,,
,519,Had One Night Of Slow Service In The Bar Area.,,,,,
,527,Food Itself Was Very Good Notwithstanding Limited Range,,,,,
,537,Excellent Wait Staff  Especially At Dinner. Beakfast Staff Less Impressive  But Okay.,,,,,
,552,Your Music Choice During The Diner :-(,,,,,
,557,We Have Told Everyone We Know How Lovely The Hotel And Our Stay Was   We Will Certainly Be Returning To The Arch   The Bed Was So Comfortable I Couldn't Believe It   We Stayed In Room 503,,,,,
,559,We Dined In Hunter 486 Twice And Both Experiences Were Quite Good.,,,,,
,561,Lovely Decor And Exceptional Friendly Staff.,,,,,
,565,Perhaps A Few More Menu Choices And Splenda As A A Sweetener Instead Of Saccharin. Breakfast Is Very Good,,,,,
,569,Breakfast Is On The Expensive Side  Especially If You Just Want A Continental Breakfast.  Coffee For 4.25 With No Refills Is On The Outrageous Side.  It's A Cultural Thing.  When You Order A Coffee And Pay 4.25Gbp  It Comes With Free Regular Coffee Refills In The Us.,,,,,
,575,Coffee Quite Often Cold Unless A Fresh Pot Was Requested,,,,,
,580,Breakfast In Bed - Who Can Complain! It Was Lovely .,,,,,
,584,The Restaurant Prices Are To Cheap For The Quality And This Could Be A Reason For Not Attracting Outside Visitors As You Assume If Its Cheap Its Not Great When Here It Is Great Food  But There Needs To Be More Verity On The Menu And That Needs To Change More Often With Maybe A Formula Lunch That Changes Or Is Themed Daily Thus Attracting Different Groups .,,,,,
,598,Breakfast Drinks And Food Were Warm Rather Than Hot,,,,,
,609,You Should Have A Breakfast Included Option In Your Rate Structure....,,,,,
,619,Nb Above Comments Apply To Dinner. Breakfast Was Good Though Service A Bit Hit And Miss,,,,,
,627,Service Although Charming Is A Little Slow.,,,,,
,629,On Arrival There Was No Meet And Greet And Allocation Of Tables This Meant People Wandering Around And Sitting At Random Tables Then Staff Did Not Know They Needed Service.  Because Of The Above Confusion Tables Were Not Always Cleared And Reset In A Timely Fashion.  9.50 For A Bowl Of Porridge Just One Example Of A Consistently Overpriced Breakfast Menu.,,,,,
,632,Serving Staff Seemed Inexperienced; Service Was Slow And Inconsistent Despite The Restaurant Being Not Full,,,,,
,635,Appreciated That They Made Some Changes To A Menu Item To Fit My Eating Patterns,,,,,
,638,Mixed Drinks Were Less Than Adequate,,,,,
,639,Bar Area Very Relaxing And Cosy- Appealing To Females If Travelling Alone,,,,,
,640,Just Used The Martini Lounge,,,,,
,654,Menu Selection Is Very Limited,,,,,
,663,Waited 25 Minutes For Coffee One Morning  Not Sure What The Problem Was But Usually Top Notch.,,,,,
,665,Excellent Service,,,,,
,667,Again Due To My Physical Problems Your Staff Who Brought My Food To My Room Were Very Helpful,,,,,
,670,None,,,,,
,675,Only Had Cocktails And Breakfast  Both Good But Quite Expensive.,,,,,
,676,Service Was Inconsistent. Coffee Needs To Be Changed.,,,,,
,682,Excellent  Accomodating Staff!,,,,,
,697,Staff Should Be More Willing To Offer Tap Water As An Option.  They Pushed The Bottled Water Even When Asking For Regular/Tap Water.  Seems Odd Given That Bottled Water Is Complimentary To Hotel Guests In Their Rooms.,,,,,
,701, I Had Breakfast Close To And A Little Past Closing Time  And Thought The Noise Of The Set-Up For Lunch Was A Bit Excessive.,,,,,
,715,Service Was A Little On The Slow Side,,,,,
,725,Only Sampled The Breakfast But This Was Delicious And The Service Was Excellent.,,,,,
,728,The Head Person In The Dining Room Was Truly Outstanding. (We Forget Her Name) We Told Her How Much We Appreciated Her Services And That It Had Contributed In Making Our Stay At Your Hotel Such An Enjoyable Experience. The Food Quality Was Excellent.,,,,,
,731,We Dined With You On Two Occasions. The First Experience Was Very Good. We Both Ordered The Chicken Dish Which Was Very Tasty  Though Somewhat Over Salted. For Our Second Meal We Both Had The Fish And Chips. That Meal Was Very Disappointing And Certainly Not Worth The Cost. The Fish Tasted More Like Frozen Fish Sticks Than Freshly Prepared Fish And The Chips Were Very Ordinary. That Was Our Last Dinner In London And We Wished We Had Selected A Different Restaurant. Staff Were Very Pleasant And Attentive On Both Occasions.,,,,,
,736,Excellent!!,,,,,
,737,Was Not Seated In The Appropriate Table For Breakfast By The Host And Did Not Explain What Is Included In My Meal Plan.,,,,,
,740,We Had The Table Overlooking The Mews On Several Occasions - Excellent. We Felt Really Well Looked After. The Omelette Was Especially Good.,,,,,
,745,Breakfast Service Was Slow And Not Well Organized,,,,,
,748,Breakfast Is Expensive,,,,,
,750,Enjoyed Breakfast Every Day. Think We Had Dinner Twice And Really Enjoyed It. I Was In London 17 Years Ago  And The Food Was Terrible. Now All The Food We Had Was Excellent!,,,,,
,751,Service Is Very Slightly Slow For Food Not Of Great Significance,,,,,
,752,Service Was Disappointing At Dinner - Both Nights - Apparently New Staff (Didn't Recognise Any From Previous) And Limited Numbers  The Restaurant And Bar Where Full And Appeared To Have Been Taken By Surprise. I Booked Dinner For Both Nights For 7.30 P.M. On My Arrival - Friday Ok - Saturday Had Not A Booking Recorded  We Had To Re-Adjust And Take An Earlier Time - And Miss Our Pre-Dinner Drink!!!! The Breakfast Staff And Arrangements Were Fine And Very Helpful But Where Is John? (The Yorkshireman),,,,,
,756,Had Only One Dinner On Arrival.,,,,,
,759,Although We Did Not Dine Here On Our Stay We Had Used The Restaurant Previously (About 3 Months Ago),,,,,
,760,See Previous Comments. Ordered Pancakes...What Came Was 2 Pancakes The Size Of A Cup Rim...Really Not Acceptable Portion For The Money,,,,,
,766,Disappointing That The Dinner Menu Did Not Change From Night To Night.  I Would Not Want To Stay With You For A Week And Eat In Every Day!,,,,,
,768,Did Not Have Room Service,,,,,
,772,Music Sometimes Too Loud,,,,,
,773,Just For One Breakfast.,,,,,
,778,Great Wait Staff In The Restaurant Every Day & Martino At The Bar Was Fantastic,,,,,
,781,Staff Were Exceptionally Friendly And Efficient,,,,,
,802,Breakfast Very Good,,,,,
,803,More Menu Item Choices Would Be Nice,,,,,
,807,I Experienced Breakfast At Your Hotel Dining And Had Egg Benedict And English Tea. That Was Less Than I Had Expected. Egg Was Great  However  Bread Was Not Soft (A Bit Too Hard).,,,,,
,810,We Were Tired And Famished On Arrival And Decided To Order Room Service.  We Asked The Person Taking The Order How Long It Would Take For The Food To Be Delivered  And She Advised It Would Be About 20 Minutes.  I Waited For 30 Minutes And Followed Up.  The Lady Who Picked Up The Call Said She Would Check  But Then Nothing Happened.  No One Came Back To Us.  I Waited For Another 10-15 Minutes And Called Again.  This Time A Man Picked Up And He Said It Would Be 'Soon'.  Another 10-15 Minutes Passed And Still No Food.  I Rang Again.  The Food Arrived After Another 15 Minutes.  The Person Who Delivered The Meal Apologised And Said The Order Was Overlooked And Was Not Put Through.  He Told Us They Would Not Charge For The Meal.  Whilst I Understand That Orders Do Get Overlooked At Times When The Kitchen Is Busy  I Do Not Understand What The Staff Actually Did When I Rang On The 3 Occasions.  I Received No Feedback  And It Was Apparent That When They Said They Would Check  Or That The Food Was Nearly Ready  They Did Not Check Nor Were They Aware No One Had The Order.  It Was Only When I Rang The Third Time That Someone Realised The Food Had In Fact Not Been Prepared.  We Stayed At The Hotel For More Than A Week  And Did Not Want To Repeat Our Experience  So We Did Not Dine At The Restaurant Or Order Room Service Again.  ,,,,,
,813,I Felt That Teh Cost Was Higher Than Equivalent Hotels In The Neighbourhood,,,,,
,814,Waiter Very Friendly And Helpful,,,,,
,817,It Was Just One Breakfast  The First Day.,,,,,
,973,Prompt And Courteous.,,,,,
,990,At Other Hotels I Have Often Come Across The "Knock And Leave" Service Which I Do Prefer For Breakfast Orders.,,,,,
,994,Club Sandwich Nowhere Near As Nice When Ordered As Room Service Compared To When Eaten In Bar,,,,,
,998,No  It Was Yummy And On Time.,,,,,
,1000,Would Prefer More Menu Choices,,,,,

,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,
,1,Service Was Slightly Below Expectation On This Occasion  But All Of The Other Qualities Of The Hotel Merit Another Stay In The Future. I'm Sure This Was Only A One-Off.  It Would Also Be Nice To Have The Choice  When Hiring A Car  To Use A Limousine / Executive Service. These Were Commended In Your Brochure (In Room)  But Our Long Journey To Brighton Was Less Comfortable Than Hoped.,,,,,
,15,Had A Working Tv,,,,,
,17,No,,,,,
,18,Cleaner Rooms..Once Housekeeping Ran Out Of Time And Decided To Just Deposit All My Bath Towels On The Chair Next To The Study Desk... Did Not Like That.   Better Bed Linen? It's A Bit Rough On The Skin.,,,,,
,24,Water + Towel In The Lobby In The Morning When Returning From Outside Run,,,,,
,28,An Enjoyable And Comfortable Stay. The Only Minor Complaint I Have Is With Breakfast. I Had Paid Breakfast Within My Room Rate. On The First Morning I Was Not Informed There Would Be A Small Additional Cost When Ordering The Cooked Breakfast. I Was Also Surprised To Be Charged 5-Pounds For Porridge On Day 2. I Would Have Anticipated No Additional Charges On Breakfast Unless I Was Ordering Something Out Of The Ordinary.,,,,,
,29,For A 5-Star Hotel All Details Should Be Perfect. There Were Quite A Few Details That Fell Below. E.G. Placement Of Mirrors And Outlets  Length Of Shower Cord Etc.,,,,,
,30,Better Value For The Cost Of The Room.,,,,,
,32,Better Skill Mix/More Staff During Dining,,,,,
,40,In The Future  For Slh Members You Should Offer The Welcome Drink And Upgrade  If It Is Not Available  Just Say So  But I Feel Like I Always Have To Tell The Staff.,,,,,
,42,Early Check-In And Later Check-Out,,,,,
,47,Not At All ,,,,,
,57,Everything Was Perfect. Thank You.,,,,,
,59,No,,,,,
,70,Water Hose In Toilets,,,,,
,75,Provided Chocolates With Bed Turn Down.,,,,,
,85,It Was Perfect.,,,,,
,86,Before Our First Breakfast The Staff  ( The Manager Of Restaurant) Didn´T Inform Us How It Works  We Had To Ask  Anyway She Didn´ T Say Us What Is Included. But The Second Day The Waitresse From Czech Republic Explain Us Everything.,,,,,
,88,More Of The Nespresso Pods In The Room? If I'm Being Picky,,,,,
,100,The Transportation That Was Booked Suddenly Told Me My Fee To The Airport Is 70 Pounds Insteadof The Initial 65 The Hotel Told Me  So There Is Need To Verfy And Check With The Drivers To Avoid A Misunderstanding Or Rip Off From These Local Drivers. Thank You,,,,,
,120,Respect People And Be Honest.,,,,,
,121,Treat The Costumer Better Upon His Arrival  And Smile Every Time You See Someone... This Is Always The First Rule Of Letting Someone Welcome,,,,,
,130,I Just Think The Front Desk Can Be A Bit 'Hit Or Miss'  They Are All Friendly  But Dont Always Seems Totally Clear.,,,,,
,131,No,,,,,
,132,Reception Staff More Attentive. Man At The Front Door More Neatly Dressed. The First Time We Thought He Was A Guest Smoking/Waiting Outside. Until We Saw Him Every Time When We Got In And Out. Just A Shirt And Trousers ... We Would Expect Suit And Tie.,,,,,
,139,Yes  A Good Afternoon Tea!,,,,,
,146,Some More Smiles Of Your Staf In The Dining Area. But They Were Polite At The End!!!,,,,,
,151,No,,,,,
,152,Turn The Temperature Down A Bit....Apart From That I Love The Hotel.  Keep Up The Good Work.,,,,,
,160,When We Were Checking Out There Was No Power  So No Lifts  And I Had To Carry My Bag Down The Stairs  It Would Have Been Good To Have Some Help With That.,,,,,
,162,The First Bill Included The Previous Occupants Laundry Charges  But His Was Rectified By Your Excellent Reception Staff.,,,,,
,163,I Was Extemely Disapponted With The Service At Breakfast On Both Days.The Staff Seemed To Wander Around And Took Ages To Order Anything And Even The Simplest Requests Such As 'Some Well Done Bacon On Its Own Plesse' Seemed To Confuse....Not Relaxing..Very Stressful!..I Appreciate People Dont Like To Be Rushed But They Dont Want To Wait 20 Minutes To Get A Coffee Either!,,,,,
,165,Greater Variety On Room Service Menu  Greater Variety On Dining Room Menu,,,,,
,166,Offered Us An Upgrade (Room) - Since We Have Stayed Many Times In The Past,,,,,
,178,Only Slightly Negative Comment Was We Had A Drink In The Bar One Night And Said When We Walked In We Only Had 20 Mins For A Quick Drink. We Were Two Customers Of Four In The Entire Restaurant And It Took 15 Minutes To Get A Drink. Bit Annoying But Only Negative Experience We Had.,,,,,
,179,As A Returning Guest  Maybe It Is Nice To Have The Receptionnist Telling You  Nice To Have You Back. Makes You Feel Even More Welcome.,,,,,
,182,Yes - Fix The Gym Equipment! The Cross Trainer Has Been Broken For Over 3 Weeks  I Have Pointed It Out To Staf On Numerous Occasions.  Given The Prices You Charge I Cannot Believe Why This Has Not Been Fixed!  If You Are Waiting For Parts Then Rent One - You Can Afford To.,,,,,
,184,We Were 3 Guests And We Got All 3 Different Bills. We All Had 2 Breakfasts. Two Of Us Are Loved Members And One Is Special. I Had To Pay For My 2 Breakfast (And I Have A Loved Membership)  The Guy With Special Membership Had To Pay For 1 And The Last (Also Loved) Paid Nothing...,,,,,
,194,Be More Friendly.,,,,,
,195,Change The Comfort Of The Beds..,,,,,
,198,Send Bills To Company So I Do Not Need To Check Out. Shoe Shine Service Sometimes Don't Work Too Well. Special Pillows Like Foams Ones Would Be Great.,,,,,
,199,I Understand If  As A General Rule  You Cannot Reserve Specific Rooms In Advance.  However  I Have Done This Countless Times Before At The Arch And That Was The Most Frustrating Aspect Of My Trip.  Why All Of A Sudden Not Allow Guests That Luxury?  It Doesn't Make Sense.  If Someone Travels There & Stays With You Enough To Really Know And Enjoy A Specific Room  Why Not Do Everything In Your Power To Give It To Them?  Rewarding Your Returning Guests Seems Like Good Business To Me.,,,,,
,200,Hotel Bill Should Be In The Name Of The Company All The Time.,,,,,
,201,Train Front Desk Staff,,,,,
,202,As Stated Previously - Have Stayed At This Hotel 15 Times. This Is Likely The Last Time. This Past Stay Was The Most Expensive Rate I Have Ever Paid And Not Worth The Money - 400 Pounds A Night! For A Standard Room With A Noisy Air Conditioner Outside My Window  An Air Conditioner That Was Not Working For My Room  A Soft Bed  And A Hassle Checking In With Confusion About A Room Facing The Street. I Have Many Colleagues From My Firm Which I Have Referrred To This Hotel That Have Also Stayed 15 Times Or More  And I Am Starting To Feel That I Would Not Recommend This Hotel To Others.,,,,,
,203,If We Had Not Had To Change Rooms It Would Have Been Better  As We Were In London For Just One Day. We Wasted Some Time In Reception. I Was Shocked At The Size And Location Of The First 'Superior' Room.,,,,,
,204,When A Customer Hurts Himself In The Room Because Lack Of Control Of Staff You Usually Compensate The Client ( Next Time You Come You Get The Third Night Free Or Something Like That) ( Most Weekend Stays Are Just Two Nights Anyway So It Is Quite Safe),,,,,
,206,Change Of Rooms,,,,,
,207,No A Great Experience Overall.,,,,,
,209,I Should Have Stayed Longer And Enjoyed The Facilities. Unfortunately I Was Just Flying Through To See Some Friends So Didnt Spend Enough Time. Michelle Took Me To The Bar And Gave Me An Inspeciation Of The Hotel  It Is Lovely.,,,,,
,210,No,,,,,
,212,No - Everything Was Excellent,,,,,
,216,There Were Some Issues Mentioned Above That Marred Our Stay  Though Overall We Had A Good Stay. The Main Disappointment Was With Our Checkout; We Requested A Late Checkout 2 Days Before We Arrived & Asked Again The Day Before Checkout. We Were Given A Letter That Said We Could Have Late Checkout At Gbp20/Hour. I Had To Explain That With Slh We Should Be Offered Complimentary Late Checkout Until 4Pm If Available. We Requested The Late Checkout Because Our 2 Year Old Needed A Nap Before A Late Flight. After Several Exchanges Which I Had To Follow Up Due To Lack Of Response/Coordination Among The Staff  We Received A Late Checkout Until 3Pm.,,,,,
,219,The Team Is Always Helpful And Polite.  Only Comment Would Be That There Has Been One Or Two Times When There Was Not A Door Person On Our Arrival.  This Is Ok For Us  But I Was Aware Of This Fact.,,,,,
,220,The Service And Quality Gets Better With Each Visit.,,,,,
,222,No It Was Perfect,,,,,
,226,Next Time I Will Book A Bigger Room.,,,,,
,227,If Possible  Could Room Keys Be Prepared In Advance Of Arrival To Speed Up Check In And Perhaps We Can Call Down Before Check Out To Speed Up Check Out,,,,,
,229,No Additional Comments.,,,,,
,230,No.,,,,,
,231,Temperatiur Of Rooms Could Be Checked Prior To Guest Arrival - Ditto Working Of Tv! There Was Also No Still Water In The Room Which I Had To Request.,,,,,
,232,Breakfast Seemed Expensive  So Perhaps This Could Be Addressed.,,,,,
,235,Wanting To Charge Gbp20 For A One Hour Extended Check Out Was Offensive And The Lady That Handled The Query Was Also Rude About The Charge (The Only Rude Person During Whole Stay) And This Charge Is The Only Reason I Would Not Recommend Or Stay In The Future. I Travel 80% Of The Time And Had Never Been Ask To Pay For A One Hour Extension To Check Out.,,,,,
,240,Nope.,,,,,
,243,Everything Was Spot On. Beautiful Hotel With Top Notch Staff. Can't Praise Them Enough.,,,,,
,245,No,,,,,
,247,Nothing Else Could Possibly Have Been Done To Enhance Our Experience.,,,,,
,248,I Thought The Lunch Menu In The Brasserie Was Not Great.,,,,,
,502,Only Thing That Could Have Been Improved Would Have Been To Have Natural Light In The Meeting Room - It Was A Litttle Claustrophobic,,,,,
,503,No,,,,,
,505,We Liked Everything And Wishing You All The Best   Thank You.,,,,,
,511,Just Get Some Savvy Crisp Service In The Dining Room And Lose The Nervous Kids That Make Me Uncomfortable. And Certainly Don't Send The Really Bad Ones To Do Room Service As Well Which Happened On My Last Visit. I Didn't Like Him In The Restaurant - I Sure Don't Want Him In My Room!,,,,,
,525,The Gym Could Do With A Bench.,,,,,
,526,The Car Service Used A Mercedes Bus ... I Think It Should Be A Comfortable Car As It Took 63Minutes To City Airport,,,,,
,527,No Very Happy With The Service,,,,,
,537,No. All Was Excellent!,,,,,
,538,Only One Thing  Very Minor But Since You Ask...The Service Around Laundry And Shoe Polishing Was Not Up To The Same Standards As The Rest Of The Hotel. Laundry Put In Did Not Come Back When Promised And A Pair Of Shoes I Put In To Be Polished Came Back Looking Look Like They Had Not Been Polished At All Or If So Done Quite Poorly. Overall We Had A Wonderful Time And This Wasn't A Big Enough Deal For Me To Reduce My Overall Rating Of Our Stay But If You Are Looking For Some Items To Improve Those Services Might Benefit From Some Review.,,,,,
,539,Nothing. Besides The Room In The Basement All Perfect. There Is No Problem With Rooms In The Basement. But The Guest Should Know In Advance,,,,,
,540,Please Improve Continental Breakfast Variety And Quality. Also Service At Breakfast Could Be Improved,,,,,
,542,Airline Rewards Points,,,,,
,552,More Details In The Final Account To Precise Which Food  Which Drinks  At What Time  Etc.,,,,,
,566,Speaking Strictly For My Personal Preference I Would Like To Find A Small Narrow Bench As Well As Several Hooks For Coats Located In The 'Landing' Area Inside The Room Door.  I Could Leave My Parcels  Purse And Coat Out Of The Actual Bed Area.,,,,,
,570,Maybe Cookies With The Teabags  Some Herbstea For A Good Sleeping  Sleepers,,,,,
,577,No - Superb,,,,,
,608,We Were There With Two Of Our Kids In Rooms 005 And 007. The Clicking Of The Door Outside 005 Was Loud And Constant. It Kept Us All Up Until Quite Late. The People Checking Into 006 One Evening Were Lou's And Constantly Opening And Closing Their Door. I Would Recommend Changing The Way The Doer Closes.,,,,,
,609,No,,,,,
,614,I Just Wish The Room Had A Lighter Blanket Choice.,,,,,
,622,The Gym Might Want Some Improvement : Both Treadmills Were Out Of Order,,,,,
,631,Keep It Up!,,,,,
,632,Give Me A Better Room  Train The Staff Better,,,,,
,633,I Find It Difficult To Fault The Arch,,,,,
,649,The Desk Staff Were Very Busy And Several Times It Was Difficult To Get Timely Service.  Had To Follow Up On Requests A Couple Of Times  They Seemed To Have Forgotten Or Just Been Too Busy To Follow Through.  They Did Seem A Bit Disorganized At Times. Not A Huge Issue  But An Opportunity For Improvement Perhaps.,,,,,
,651,I Thought That The Service And Selection At Breakfast Could Have Been Better. We Were Not Offered Juice Or Have Our Coffee Replenished. Fresh Fruit Was Not Of Particularly Good Quality And Plates Of Cheese  Ham Were Nearly Empty  Limited Selection If Pastries And Bread  If Staying Again We Would Not Opt For Breakfast,,,,,
,655,No,,,,,
,662,Any Loyalty Programs?,,,,,
,666,The More I Stay - The More I Like It. Very Good Service But At The Same Time Discreet And Unfussy.,,,,,
,667,Could Not Have Been More Helpful From Your Porter To Duty Manager,,,,,
,670,Very Very Satisfied - Would Like To Single Out Theo For Assisting In Planning Our Events In London - Such As The Aqua Shard For Dinner  Tickets For The Billy Elliot Show  Dinner Cruise Down The Thames  Bus Tour Round City - Could Not Ask For More - He Wanted To Ensure That We Had A Memorable First Time Stay In London - Theo Came Thru - The Show The Dinier Cruise All That He Planned We Were Very Pleased With. Thank You,,,,,
,672,None! Loved The Hotel And Hope To Return.,,,,,
,674,Nothing I Can Think Of.,,,,,
,675,I Wished The Coffee Machine Made Hot Chocolate!  I Loved The Fact That Water And Soft Drinks Were Free. Overpriced Mini Bar Items Such As Water Would Really Irritate Me.  We Had Everything We Needed.,,,,,
,678,None,,,,,
,681,Nothing You Seem To Do Everything Exceptionally Well.,,,,,
,683,Is It Possible To Review The Final Account In The Room Via The Tv Or Internet In Advance To Speed Up The Process At Check Out?,,,,,
,685,The Last Few Days Room Maintenance Was Erratic  With Housekeeping Not Showing Up Until Mid - To Late Afternoon.,,,,,
,688,Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay As We Always Do.   Will Not Hesitate To Book Again.,,,,,
,697,Just A Suggestion About Concierge Services:  I Asked For Suggestions For Dining Within Walking Distance And The Staff Gave Me A Where Magazine.  I Would Have Expected A Short List Of Restaurants Within 3-5 Blocks Vs. A Magazine That Likely Has Paid Advertisements From Restaurants.,,,,,
,701,Not Really. You Do A Wonderful Job! Thank You.,,,,,
,704,My Wife Was Hoping There Was A Swimming Pool!,,,,,
,714,Just To Try And Improve The Water Heating System  Not A Big Fan Of Tepid Showers!,,,,,
,717,Quantity Of Food Available On Breakfast Buffet Could Have Been Slightly Greater. I Was Reluctant To Take Last Slices Of Fruit  For Instance  Even Though I Knew That It Would Immediately Be Replenished. Also  I Would Have Been Happier To Make My Own Toast  Rather Than Impose On Staff To Carry Out This Simple Task For Me.,,,,,
,727,My Only Comment Was The Bed In My Room Everything Else Was Fabulous.  I Love The Feel Of The Hotel And Everyone Is Gracious And Kind.,,,,,
,728,Our Stay Met With Our Expectations. We Have Visited London A Lot In The Last 5 Years And We Did Stay At Other Hotels  But When We Found Your Hotel 2 Years Ago It Has Been Our Hotel In London Ever Since. To Be Honest We Have Looked At Other Hotels  But Came To The Conclusion That Because Of Our Overall Experience During Our 4 Stays At Your Hotel And Its Great Location It Made No Sense To Stay Elsewhere When In London.,,,,,
,729,Would Like To Have A More Direct Return Guest Treatment .. Not Through Slh,,,,,
,736,Not A Thing.,,,,,
,750,Not Really,,,,,
,768,No. Your Entire Team Couldn't Have Been Any Better Or Have Done Any More For Us. The Arch Is An Exceptional Hotel.,,,,,
,769,Breakfast Arrangements Certainly Let The Experience Down,,,,,
,772,Stayed Longer!,,,,,
,775,Better Weather!!,,,,,
,776,No,,,,,
,778,The Concierge Could Have Been A Little More Up To Date With Stage Show Ticket Pricing - We Saved 40 Each To See Spamalot By Booking Online Rather Than Accepting Her Quote - Initially She Told Us Spamalot Wasn't Even On.,,,,,
,789,My Only 2 Complaints Would Be The Room Temp And I Had A Burnt Pizza When We Ate At The Restaurant,,,,,
,791,We Checked In Late 8Pm  And Got A Room That Had 'Just Been' Made Up. Had 10Pm Flight,,,,,
,825,There Is A Definite Need Of A Better Concierge Service With The Knowledge Of The Area And The Restaurants For The Need Of The Guests. That Was One Problem We Faced. In A City Hotel The Concierge Is The Most Important Service For The Guests In My Opinion,,,,,
,830,A Complimentary Newspaper Or Breakfast Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,
,841,This Is A Small Observation On The Room Tea And Coffee. The Selection Of Nespresso Capsules Was Limited. The English Tea Wasnt The Best.,,,,,
,970,No  I Would Say : This Was My Best Stay In London Ever.,,,,,
,975,Extended My Stay,,,,,
,977,Improve Your Gym,,,,,
,982,If You Cant Sleep Because Of Noise  Nothing Else Matters N'est Pas?,,,,,
,986,I Think The One Little Thing That Slightly Irks Me Is The Obsession With The Final Bill.  We Pay A Pro-Forma In Advance Of The Meeting And Credit Card Details Are Left For Any Extras.  However There Is Always A Mini Drama With It Being Signed At The End.  It's Only A Little Thing But It Feels A Little Uncomfortable.,,,,,
,990,Its Is Always A Pleasure To Stay At The Arch,,,,,
,993,The Staff Failed To Give Us Theatre Tickets That We Had Ordered.
The Problem Was Satisfactorily Sorted Out.,,,,,
,994,A Stronger Light To Apply Makeup At The Dressing Table/Desk As Husband In Bathroom!,,,,,
,998,Fix The Squeeky/Loose Floorboards.  I Was Awoken In The Night By Other Guests Walking Around. As I Was On Holiday I Would Have Loved To Sleep In But Could Hear All The Guests And Staff Walking Up And Down The Corridor In The Morning.  If I'd Had An Uninterrupted Night's Sleep  This Stay Would Have Been Absolutely Perfect!,,,,,
,1007,See On Point 10,,,,,
,1008,Heating Was A Problem.,,,,,
,1022,A Few Hiccups With Breakfast Orders But Such A Minor Blip In The Bigger Picture.,,,,,

,1,Thank You For Your Hospitality.,,,,,
,6,I Very Much Enjoyed My Stay At The Arch London And I Will Definitely Return!,,,,,
,8,Would Be Extremely Keen On Returning To The Arch For All Future Events We Wish To Hold In London.,,,,,
,11,Staff Were Very Welcoming And Made Me Feel Very Much At Home  Rooms Are Beautifully Decorated And The Food Was Delicious And Very Reasonably Priced. Thank You For A Lovely Stay,,,,,
,13,A Great Hotel.,,,,,
,16,The Power Plate At The Gym Room Is Really Great!,,,,,
,17,Thanks A Lot For Everything's And See You Soon,,,,,
,18,Be Careful Of The Amount Of Detergent/Cleaning Agents You Use For The Room And The Towels? Developed An Allergic Reaction Once When The Odor From Cleaning Was Particularly Strong,,,,,
,21,We Were Very Grateful For The Free Champagne After The Problems At Check-In!,,,,,
,28,I Very Much Liked Staying In Your Hotel And Would Consider Returning. I Do However Feel The Prices Charged Are Slightly Excessive.,,,,,
,30,We Were Disappointed With The Size Of The Room For How Much It Cost.,,,,,
,31,My Stay With You Was As Always Outstanding.,,,,,
,40,Still A Great Hotel And I Will Be There Next Month.,,,,,
,47,Would Highly Reccomend,,,,,
,48,Superb Stay As Always ,,,,,
,52,We Had An Excellent Stay And Very Much Enjoyed The Arch London.  We're Already Looking Forward To Visiting Again And Will Certainly Recommend This Hotel To Our Friends.  Thanks Very Much!,,,,,
,58,Good With Possibility To Borrow Dvds  But Tricky To Find The Right Channel (26?) Without Instructions.,,,,,
,59,Wonderful Stay - Thank You,,,,,
,61,A Very Special Place To Stay  Thank You!,,,,,
,62,It Was Wonderful That The Manager Acknowledged My Birthday And Made It Feel Special. The Chef Was Very Helpful In Making Baby Friendly Meals. Thank You,,,,,
,63,I Will Definitely Be Back With My Family In Future. It Truly Is Incredible To Find Such Down To Earth And Helpful Staff In A Hotel Of This Calibre,,,,,
,75,We Really Appreciated The Complimentary Water  Soda And Nespresso Machine In The Room. Such A Nice Thing To Come Home To Water By The Bed And To Wake Up With An Espresso In The Morning!,,,,,
,88,Wonderful Hotel  All Staff Were Fantastic. Can't Wait To Come Back. Also  Thank You For The Upgrade  It Made Our Stay Even Better.,,,,,
,90,Very Nice Hotel  We Will Come Back!,,,,,
,91,Thank You For Making My Wife's Birthday Special  The Chocolate Cake Delivered To Our Room Was Much Appreciated!,,,,,
,94,Please Keep Me Informed If There Are Any Promotions As I Would Love To Stay Here With My Fiance Or Recommend To My Family When They Come To Visit Me:  Kate.Ardehali@Gmail.Com  I Love This Place.,,,,,
,101,The Service Is Wonderful.  The Staff Is Very Nice And They Respond Very Well And Efficient.  To Further Enhance  I Suggest That The Members Of Staff Could Be More Active To The Guests Coming In.  When We Checked In  Arriving With Baggages  The Concierge Staff Were Very Helpful And Actively Picked Up Our Baggages.  By The Way  In Other Time During Our Stay  When We Stepped Into The Lobby  We Expected Someone Would Come Up At Once And Asked If We Need A Favour.  By The Way  In Most Cases  They Were Just Looking At Us With Smile And In A Stand-By Mode  Though They Provided Excellent Services Once We Approached Them And Made Our Requests.  To Conclude  Both The Size And The Atmosphere In The Reception Could Be More Welcoming.  Apart From This Point  The Whole Experience Was Wonderful.,,,,,
,104,My Best Hotel Experience  Thanks.,,,,,
,111,Final Bill Was Incorrect - Included Drinks That I'd Already Paid For And Breakfast That Should Have Been Complimentary As Part Of The Package. However  When I Pointed This Out The Bill Was Amended Very Swiftly To What It Should Have Been.,,,,,
,117,Would Be Better If Vat Was Included In Price On Website To Avoid Confusion,,,,,
,124,The Shower Leaked. It Was 'Fixed' But Was Not Really Fixed. My Choices Were To Change Rooms After Moving In Or Complain And Have Them Come Again. It Was A Tough Position To Be In And Not A Comfortable One. Too Bad Really.,,,,,
,125,Free Softdrinks And Water In The Room Plus Excellent Coffee Service (Including Real Milk) Made Me Feel Really At Home.  Good Concept.,,,,,
,131,No,,,,,
,132,Nice Touch To The Daily Differntly Presented Complimentory Water Or Chocolates Nearby Reception. Never Seen It Like That. Gives An Extra!  The Fact That Water/Soda Is Complimentory And The Luxurious Nespresso Machine Give An Extra Home Feel To The Room.,,,,,
,133,Thanks For Everything. Will Hopefully Be Staying With You Again In The Not Too Distant Future,,,,,
,135,Overall It Was A Great Stay And I Will Definitely Return On My Next Visit.,,,,,
,140,Wines By The Glass Listed In Bar/Restaurant Menu Were Apparently Not Available,,,,,
,146,Will Try To Be Coming Back.,,,,,
,151,No,,,,,
,155,I Have Previously Stayed At The Hotel For Business And Have Always Found The Staff Consistently Helpful And In Sure Will Be Back,,,,,
,160,There Was A Power Outage  Which Affected The Hydraulics In The Building  So Basically No Water.  This Diminished The Stay A Little Bit  But It Was No One's Fault - It Was Just An Issue That Arose On The Particular Day We Were Checking Out.  I Would Have Liked To Use The Gym Facilities As They Looked Nice  But As I Would Not Have Been Able To Have A Shower After  I Did Not Do That.  This Was Just An Unlucky Thing  As I Say - No One's Fault - Perhaps Something To Think About Long Term With The Supply Of Water To The Building.,,,,,
,163,I Asked To Change Rooms On The 2Nd Day As I Had Been Disturbed By Restaurant Staff Early That Morning. Reception Staff Sorted This Out Efficently And I Was Given A Lovely Room,,,,,
,175,I Am Noriko  Back In Japan.  We Really Enjoyed Staying At Your Hotel For Five Nights.  We Appreciated The Clean And Beautiful Room  The Food  And The Friendly Hospitality By Your Staff.  We Look Forward To Staying At Your Hotel Again.  Thank You Very Much For Your Kindness And Hospitality.,,,,,
,177,I Used The Express Check Out. So Was Expecting A Final Invoice To Be Emailed To Me (As Stated It Would Be On The Express Check Out Form) I Have Yet To Receive This.,,,,,
,181,High Guality  But A Bit Too Expencive Overall.,,,,,
,182,Take The Feedback Seriously.,,,,,
,187,The Meeting Room Was Not Set Up On Time. We Had A 10.00 Meeting And Drinks Were Only Deliveres At 10.15.,,,,,
,190,I Liked The Upgrade Facilty You Offer At Booking Stage  However  I Wasnt Sure If We Had Been Upgraded Or Not As This Want Made Clear At Check In. I Think We Were Upgraded As We Were Charged The Upgrade Fee On The Final Bill Which Was Fine. Just Wasn't Clarified At Check In. We Had An Excellent Time. 5* All The Way! Much Better Than We Thought And Good Value For Money.,,,,,
,194,It Was The Second Time I Stayed In Your Hotel  I Was Really Disappointed With The Cold Welcome. At The Contrary With My First Stay  I Would Say That I Didn't Feel Like Home. ,,,,,
,198,There Are Only Lady Weights In The Gym To Work Out ! Pls Add Another Rack With More Heavy Weights. Otherwise Nice  Well Equiped Gym.,,,,,
,200,I Suggest To Arrange For Corporate Rates.,,,,,
,204,Check Your Rooms Better... Apart From Mattress The Phone And Skybox Didn't Work Properly... Easy To Check And Fix And Avoids Bad Impression,,,,,
,207,Service And Attention To Detail During The Programme Was Excellent,,,,,
,208,Truly A Benchmark For Consistent Quality And Service.,,,,,
,209,I'll Be Very Happy To Refer Business To The Hotel. I Know They Will Be Taken Care Of. I Was Very Impressed With The Location,,,,,
,210,Do You So Corporate Rates ?  Angels1@Btconnect.Com I Stay For Business Around 25 Niftd Per Year And If The Price Was Acceptable I Would Like To Use This As A Base ? T Devine,,,,,
,212,Wonderful Stay And An Awesome Property - We Will Definitely Stay Again On Future Trips To London.,,,,,
,215,Thank You For A Great Stay.,,,,,
,216,In General We Think The Hotel Is Doing A Great Job At Hiring Efficient Staff With Good Attitudes  Which Results In Great Service Most Of The Time  But The Staff Seem To Lack A Bit Of Coordination. The Food  Facilities & Location Are Great. The Complimentary Minibar & Coffee/Tea Are An Excellent Touch & Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,218,Thank You For A Lovely Stay  Something I Am Hoping To Repeat With My Husband In The Near Future,,,,,
,227,Sometimes I Am Unable To Get A Room Which Is Disappointing As The Old Sale Manager Emma Green Promised Me A Room On Every Occasion (I Am Looking To Book A Room 2 Nights A Week Every Week However I Need To Be Sure I Can Secure A Room),,,,,
,229,Great Staff Members And Internet Service In All The Hotel.,,,,,
,231,Generally This Is An Excellent Hotel With Superior Staff Who Make You Feel Very Welcome. Unfortunately The Rooms Bookings Have Not Worked Out For My Forthcoming Trips Due To Nothing Being Available At Our Corporate Rate Which Means I Have Had To Use Competitors.,,,,,
,237,I Think You Should Have A Selection Of White Wine In The Fridge...,,,,,
,239,Thank You!,,,,,
,240,Brilliant  Brilliant Hotel.  Exlcuding Some Foreign Hotels We've Stayed At This Was By Far The Best Uk Hotel We've Stayed At.  Now If You Could Provide 25C Sunny Weather  A Private Pool  Then I Think You May Top Our List!!,,,,,
,242,The Little Attention On My Husbabs's Birthday (Cakes In The Room) Was Very Much Appreciated And So Delicate !,,,,,
,245,Thanks Again. Glad To Stay And Happy To Recommend,,,,,
,247,Please See Prior Comments. Thank You.,,,,,
,501,We Had Stayed At Your Location 20+ Years Ago When It Was The Bryanston Court Hotel!  We Were Surprised And Delighted.  The Remodelling Of The Hotel Is Exceptional.,,,,,
,503,Not At The Moment,,,,,
,506,Look Forward To Next Time Thank You,,,,,
,509,The Staff On Reception Were Extremely Helpful. The Comment Above Related To Some Minor Charges For Tea And Coffee That Had Been Incorrectly Charged  But The Situation Was Quickly Resolved. As We Were Leaving On Foot We Realised We Had Forgotten Our Umbrella. Your Staff Kindly Provided Us With One Free Of Charge. We'll Just Have To Return It One Day!,,,,,
,510,Just Want To Set Up An Account So You Can Invoice My Office,,,,,
,511,Like The Arch Lots,,,,,
,523,I Checked My Bags With The Hotel After I Checked Out - So I Could Walk Around For The Day Without My Luggage. I Had $140-160 Dollars In My Wallet That Was Stolen From My Bags During This Time. I Am 100% Positive The Money Was In My Bag  As Checking My Wallet To Ensure I Had Enough American Dollars When I Returned To The States Was The Absolute Last Thing I Did Before Leaving My Room That Morning. It Was My Own Stupidity For Leaving The Money In My Bag. Having Said That  It Was A Definite Disappointment  After Having Such An Excellent Experience Otherwise.,,,,,
,524,It Was Very Nice And Convenient To Be Offered Free Softdrinks From Minibar,,,,,
,540,Thank You,,,,,
,542,No,,,,,
,543,Just Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,559,A Truly Wonderful Boutique Hotel. We Enjoyed The Gym And The Cleanliness Of The Hotel In Every Area. We Will Be Back And I've Already Shared The Hotel Name With Friends!,,,,,
,565,I Have Stayed At This Hotel Many Times Since It Opened. It Just Keeps Getting Better.,,,,,
,569,I Used To Be A Loyal Firmdale Client.  I'm Now An Arch Convert.  Between The Overall Ambience And Experience  The Great Staff  The Free Internet And Your Gym  It Will Be My Home Away From Home.  Many Thanks! Margot Hirsch,,,,,
,581,Thank You For Making Our Stay In London A Real Pleasure. So Glad We Stayed At The Arch.,,,,,
,586,It Was A Real Pleasure To Stay In This Very Nice Place During Our Trip........Thanks,,,,,
,588,Great Location  Very Quiet So Had A Good Nights Sleep In An Exceptionally Comfortable Bed.,,,,,
,589,Fantastic Levels Of Hospitality And Service,,,,,
,594,We're Glad That We Decided To Switch From The Montcalm To The Arch,,,,,
,598,We Had A Lovely Stay.  Hotel In A Wonderful Location  Quiet Road But Very Near To The Tube And Amenities.,,,,,
,599,A Wonderful Stay.  Thank You.,,,,,
,600,Overall And Extremely Well Run Hotel With Great Staff.,,,,,
,602,Very Pleasant Stay At The Arch - Thank You!,,,,,
,606,I´M Sure Than Room 217 Was Not A Deluxe Room...But Quiet..So I Didn`T Critize It Again. Room 012 Was Great But Too Noisy...In Other 5 Star Hotels Normaly The Guest Will Become An Upgrade. That´S The Only Thing I Have To Critize.,,,,,
,609,No,,,,,
,611,The Hotel Was A Fabulous Expereince  And Your Manager Is A Very Warm And Accomodating Person. A Memorable Experience All Around. Thank You.,,,,,
,614,It As Very Nice And The Conciergre Was Excellent.,,,,,
,617,There Were Many Plusses  And We Were Well Looked After By The Staff On Our Wedding Night  But The Fridge Light Experience Was A Disappointment. I Also Received An Unexplained Charge On My Credit Card Of 5.63. I Have No Idea What It This Relates To. It Would Be Nice To Be Told.,,,,,
,619,The Only Reason Why Return To The Arch Is 'Maybe' Is Because We Do Not Normally Stay In London - This Was A Special Occasion (25Th Wedding Anniversary),,,,,
,627,Yes.  We Look Forward To Being With You Again On 9Th January.,,,,,
,628,I Appreciate That Completely Positive Comments Aren't Always What You Want From These Surveys But It Was That Good. You Were Originally Recommended To Me By Another Hotelier So I Shouldn't Be Too Surprised.,,,,,
,631,Apart From 'Thank You'  No Further Comment From Me!,,,,,
,633,It Would Be Nice If The Arch Were To Have A Loyalty Programme. I Have Recently Booked Two Stays At The Arch At A Cheaper Rate Than Through Your Own Website. That Does Not Strike Me As A Win/Win For Us - Although Lastminute Benefit.,,,,,
,635,Most Hotels Quote The Business Rates With Vat Included.  Makes Comparison Easier When Choosing.  The Arch Is The Only Hotel I Have Used Recently That Quotes The Rate Before Vat.  Misleading - The Price Is The Price So It Should Be Quoted With Vat,,,,,
,639,Really Appreciated The Free Water And Soft Drinks And The Fabulous Bathroom Products,,,,,
,655,No,,,,,
,658,Bit Fed Up With Getting A Survey Every Time I Stay,,,,,
,659,A Lovely Hotel. Thank You For Everything!,,,,,
,664,We Like The Place  Would Stay More Often If We Could Agree Corporate Rates,,,,,
,667,The Best Hotel Experience I Have Enjoyed For A Very Long Time And I Would Like Thank Everyone For Their Help,,,,,
,668,Keep It Up!,,,,,
,670,None,,,,,
,672,I Travel All Over The World And Stay In Hotels When I Do (Often Alone). I Loved My Experience At The Arch And Will Definitely Stay There Again.,,,,,
,674,Only To Say It Is Very Nice When You Travel For Business To Stay In A Nice Clean Comfortable  Hotel With Staff That Are Very Helpful And Polite. Especially For Me I Always Need Packages Sent By Courier And It Is Always Looked After For Me. Most Appreciated.,,,,,
,675,Thank You,,,,,
,676,The Arch Will Be Our Home Away From Home When We Are In London. Your Location Is A+ And Your Staff Is Very Professional  Helpful And Without Attitude Which Is Very Much Appreciated. Loved The Decor And The Fact That The Hostel And Rooms Were Spotless. Congratulations On A Wonderful Hotel. We Will Be Back!,,,,,
,678,We Look Forward To Coming Back With Our Daughters For Another Stay Soon.  We Traveled To Your Hotel From America And Have Stayed In London Many Times In The Past.  Your Hotel Is By Far The Best One We Have Stayed With.  We Especially Appreciated Having Excellent Dining And The Gym On The Premises. Thank You Very Much!  Cheryl Wetmore-Simpson  Charlottesville  Virginia,,,,,
,679,Not Really All Was Excellent .,,,,,
,681,Keep Up The Good Work.,,,,,
,682,Look Forward To Visiting You Again.,,,,,
,683,Booked My Stay Through Slh.Com And Have Stayed At The Arch Multiple Times.  The Booking Indicates A Welcome Drink And Gift.  Am I Supposed To Ask For These?  No One Mentioned Them.,,,,,
,685,Aside From The Issues Mentioned  We Were Very Impressed With The Attentiveness And Level Of Care  The Quiet Comfort And The Luxurious Touches Provided.,,,,,
,690,I Look Forward To Our Next Stay.,,,,,
,691,Only Issue Although I Stayed On My Own  My Invoice Read Mr & Mrs  Few Problems To Get It Resolved,,,,,
,693,Keep Up The Good Work !,,,,,
,696,You May Consider A Television Review Of The Final Account In Advance To Getting To The Desk So That Errors Can Be Addressed Before The Guest Gets Down To The Desk.  The Time It Takes To Revise The Bill Is Always Long And The Car Service Hates Waiting.   If There Is Something That I Should Do Differently  Please Advise.,,,,,
,701,As A Marketing Academic  I Would Be Interested In How You Train Your Employees To Provide Customer Service. If That Is Inappropriate To Share With Me  Please Just Pass On This Comment.,,,,,
,703,Love You Guys!,,,,,
,708,The Standard Room And The Bed Is A Bit Small For 2 Persons.,,,,,
,718,Loved The Hotel And It's Location Was Ideal For The Purpose Of Our Stay. If Back In London Would Not Hesitate To Stay Here Again. Many Thanks.,,,,,
,719,We Have Stayed At The Arch Before And It Always Meets Our Expectations Of A Luxury London Hotel In An Ideal Location.,,,,,
,721,I Almost Feel Guilty Saying You Only Met My Expectations But This Is The Third Time We Have Stayed With You And So We Had High Expectations Based On Previous Visits  Which You Met In Full.,,,,,
,725,We've Stayed 3 Or 4 Times Now And Have Booked To Stay On Sunday  17Th March For 2 Nights And Really Looking Forward To It.   The Hotel Is Beautifully Furnished And The Rooms Are Very Comfortable And From A Value Point Of View  It Is Very Reasonable Compared To A Lot Of Hotels In London.   It Is Also Well Located.  Will Continue To Stay With You.,,,,,
,731,Staying With You Helped Make Our Stay In London A Very Enjoyable Experience.,,,,,
,736,Keep Up The Good Work.  I Liked A Lot The Location Of The Hotel And The Surroundings.   Had A Great Stay And Even Though I Am Far From London (Costa Rica) I Will Be Back In Part Because Of The Hotel.  Best Regards,,,,,
,740,The Best Hotel Stay We Have Ever Had  In London.,,,,,
,744,I Left Our Tooth Brush Charger In The Bathroom. Following An Email To You  You Confirmed That Housekeeping Had Found It And Arrangements Were Made For It To Be Sent On To Us And This Has Been Received.,,,,,
,745,I Very Much Liked The Location Of The Hotel  Its Size And Surroundings,,,,,
,746,We Have Now Stayed Twice With The Arch. We Intend To Stay Again When We Next Return To London.,,,,,
,751,Keep It Up We Are Coming Lots More!,,,,,
,752,We Enjoy Our Stays  My Daughter (Adult) Is Totally Wheelchair Bound And Everyone Is So Helpful. The Prebooking Arrangements Were Very Helpful As Usual - We Need Multi[Le Rooms With One For Disabled Access - Never Anyh Trouble Expressed.  Thank You.,,,,,
,754,Breakfast Orders Quite Often Slow And Inaccurate. There Seems Sometimes To Be A Discontinuity Between The Order To The Waiter And This Being Relayed Accurately To The Cook,,,,,
,764,Still Waiting To Hear From You About Staying 2 Nights 29Th And 30Th March,,,,,
,768,As I Mentioned Earlier I Am Something Of A Traditionalist. I Have Stayed In 'Trendy' Hotel That Have Made Me Feel Very Uncomfortable But The Arch Has Achieved That Difficult Balance Of Being Stylish In A Very Acceptable Way. It Is High Class Without Stating It.,,,,,
,771,I Always Ask For Room 319 When Booking And Usually Get It. Would Like This To Be Guaranteed As I Book A Good Time In Advance,,,,,
,775,We Already Sent In An Unsolicited E-Mail Commenting Very Favourably On Our Stay.  The Arch Was Probably As Good As Any Hotel We Have Ever Visited.,,,,,
,776,Keep Up The Very Good Work You Are Doing,,,,,
,790,The Reception's Staff Was Helpful And Very Polite  But They Should Be Able To Give Us More Precise Information That A Tourist May Need. Secondly  I Think That You Should Have A More Personal Contact With The Client After His Arrival By Offering For Example Some Fruit Or Sweets And A Welcome Card From The Director. Furthermore  As We Are Mediterranian  We Prefered The Warmth And Friendliness Of Your Latin Staff  Instead Of The Typical Politeness Of The Other Staff,,,,,
,807,Head Of Concierge At Your Hotel Kindly Supported My Favor.,,,,,
,825,If I Feel That These Two Problems That We Have Faced Were To Get Better I Would Always Choose And Recommend The Arch Hotel.,,,,,
,830,The Arch Does Many Things Very Well.,,,,,
,971,Provide Twinings Tea Bags In The Rooms  The Fancy Ones Which You Currently Supply Do Not Taste Of Anything.,,,,,
,982,Only Way I Would Consider Staying Again Would Be On Top Floor,,,,,
,985,Room 607,,,,,
,990,I Look Forward To Seeing You Soon,,,,,
,993,For The Right Price We Would Always Use The Arch  ,,,,,
,994,Hot Chocolate And Biscuits Be Nice In Room! A Choice Of Less Floral/Aromatic Teas!,,,,,
,998,I Loved The Hotel And Would Be Happy To Stay With You Again.,,,,,
,999,The Free Soft Drinks In The Room Is An Excellent Perk  Especially When One Has To Work From The Room,,,,,
,1000,Would Suggest More Menu Options In Restaurant,,,,,
,1008,Keep Working Hard,,,,,
