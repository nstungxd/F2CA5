We Ordered The Gin Fusion Menu And The Starter Arrived And Was Fantastic. We Then Waited More Than An Hour For Our Main  With Waiting Staff Giving Mixed Impressions Of Why That Was. One Staff Member Admitted The Main Chef Had Just Walked Out And That Waiting Staff Were Filling In  Which Was Rather Alarming. It Did Explain Our Mains  Which Were Mediocre At Best And Not As Listed On The Menu. When We Asked About This We Got Blank Expressions And No Real Apology. We Were Given An Extra Gin  Without Comment Or Explanation. We Did Ask For The Scallops Which Were Supposed To Accompany The Monkfish And We Did Then Receive These As A Side Between The Main And Dessert. The Desserts Were Fine But Not As Exciting As The Starter.  The Bill Was Not Included Within Our Final Checkout Bill But Wasn't Explained As We Did Query. We Assume It Was Because Of Our Disappointing Experience But It Would Have Been Appreciated If This Was Explained To Us  Rather Than Making Us Ask About Why It Wasn't There Which Wasn't The Most Comfortable Experience.   ,,,,,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Could Have Done Better,,I Think It's Covered Under Dining Experience.,Female,25-34,,,,,,,,,Emily Alexander,...
