I Arrived 30 Minutes Early (As Had Not Long Arrived In The Hotel  So Would Have Struggled To Make 45 Minutes. The Medical Disclaimer Form And Getting Changed Took All Of 5 Minutes  So Was Left With A Lot Of Time To Kill. Perhaps 45 Minutes Is A Bit Of An Overestimation.,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Fell Below,,My Husband And I Booked The Upgrade Deal (Upgrade To The Next Available Room Type  2 Quarter Bottles Of Champagne  5 Course Tasting Menu Included). On Our Drive Down From Scotland (Which Was Supposed To Be Leisurely  With A Couple Of Stops To Break Things Up)  I Became Aware Of A Voice Mail Message On My Phone  From A Yorkshire Number  That I Was Unable To Access For An Hour Or So Due To A Lack Of Mobile Phone Reception. This Was Slightly Unsettling  As I Realised It Was From Your Hotel  And Was Unsure Whether There Was A Problem With The Room  Eg A Double Booking. When I Was Able To Access The Message  It Was To Inform Us That The Kitchen Was Out Of Use (Extractor Fans Not Working  Therefore Unable To Use The Gas) And That We Couldn't Have Dinner At The Restaurant. While It Was Great That Alternative Arrangements Had Been Made At The Black Swan  We Were Disappointed That Our Room Rate Was Only Reduced To Â£140 B+B  Whereas We Were Expecting To Pay Â£220 For Db+B - As The Tasting Menu Was Â£50 Pp At The Black Swan  Meaning The Price Of Our Night Away Jumped To Â£240. The Fact That A Tasting Menu Was Included In The Initial Deal Was The Main Reason We Booked  As We Enjoy Our Food  And The Experience Of A Tasting Menu. My Husband Did Raise This Issue With The Reception Staff On The Day Of Our Arrival  And After Some Discussion It Was Agreed That The B+B Rate Would Be Reduced To Â£120  After All  It Was Not Our Fault That We Were Not Being Propvided With What We Booked.  We Were Assured That There Would Be A Full Breakfast On In The Morning  Which We Were Dubious About As We Were Not Sure How Likely The Fans Would Have Been Fixed From The Previous Evening. The Waiting Staff Told Us That Instead Of Individually Prepared Breakfasts  A Cooked Buffet Had Been Organised. Not Quite The Same To Us  But Can't Fault The Helpfulness And Friendliness Of The Staff That Morning.   When We Came To Settle The Bill  We Were Very Disappointed To Find That The Rate Hadn't Been Discounted To Â£140 As Discussed And That We Had To Make Our Point Again.   All In All  A Lovely Hotel  But Wasn't Quite The Experience We Were Hoping For  I Think Coloured Slightly By The Phone Message On The Way Down  And Wondering What The Alternative Dining Experience Would Be Like. (Which Turned Out To Be Lovely  But We Had No Knowledge Of The Black Swan Prior To The Arrival).  ,,Female,25-34,Louise Phillips,,,,,,,,... Please Select The Box

The Hotel Is In A Great Spot - And The Pool Really Makes The Hotel Stand Out - Its A Pretty And Relaxing Place To Spend Time It Could Be Outstanding But It Just Falls Down On A Few Key Basics  Specifically:  - Standard Of Maintenance -Fix The Broken Things  Paint The Peeling Things  Replace The Worn Out Things  - Standard Of Service - I Suspect Better Training Is Needed - Especially For The Youngsters - Do They Know The Standard That You Expect From Them?  - The Restaurant - The Pricing Sets Expectations Of Excellence Which Is Almost (But Not Entirely) Met By The Food But Not At All By The Rest Of The Experience,We Did Overall Enjoy Our Stay - But Ive Tried To Be Constructive In This Feedback As I Presume You Want Honest Answers Of What Should Be Done To Improve.  Now - The Truth Is  I Suspect That You Have Some Financial Constraints That Are Preventing Some Of These Things Beings Addressed (Otherwise How Would You Not Have Noticed & Repaved The Stair Carpet!) - So Some Prioritisation Is Likely Called For  Hope That Helps !  A,Honestly I Think You Have Other Things To Focus On First. I'd Check What Power Youre Consuming To Heat The Pool - And It Not Already The Case Id Consider A Heat Pump Or Solar System.

The Service Felt Rushed And Not What We Expected From A Hotel Of The Feversham's Calibre. We Also Had An Issue When I Ordered A Glass Of Rose And On Ordering A 2Nd Glass A Different Wine Was Served And The Waiter Was Unable To Understand What The Issue Was  Due To A Language Difficulty. We Gave Up Trying To Explain It In The End. Also  My Husband's Halibut Arrived 'Black'  Which Wasn't Specified On The Menu.
