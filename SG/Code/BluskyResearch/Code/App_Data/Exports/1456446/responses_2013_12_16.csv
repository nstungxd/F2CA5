However  The Meal We Had At The Pavillion At Lunchtime Was Very Poor. The Gentleman Who Served Us (Fairly Young  Reddish Tint Hair) Took Too Long To Take Our Orders  When We Asked What The Soup Of The Day Was He Couldn’T Remember And Then Said ‘Leek And Umm’ And Couldn’T Think What It Was And Our Party Said At The Same Time ‘Potato?’. A Soup Spoon Was Not Given To The Person Having Soup. Service Was So Slow I Had To Ask For My Main To Be Brought With The Starters As I Had A Treatment Booked In And Did Not Want To Miss It. This Did However Mean That I Missed Out On My Inclusive Dessert. I Would Expect Service At An Establishment Like Stapleford To Be Much Better Than This. Also  When Booking Treatments And Lunch When I Booked The Break  No-One Said That The Timings Would Be An Issue. If Lunch Is Going To Take 2+ Hours Then I Think You Should Let People Know So They Can Allow For This When Booking Golf/Spa Treatments.   ,,,,,,,,,,Spa Break,,,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,,Agree,Agree,Agree,,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,,Met,Our Bill Was A Nightmare. Instead Of Allocating Drinks And Deposits To Individual Rooms They Had All Been Put On One Bill. The Drinks On The Invoice Were Not Easy To Understand And So We Asked For It To Be Broken Down But This Was Also Difficult As There Were Several Mistakes And Things Debited And Then Credited. The Staff Did Eventually Work Out The Drinks Bill So That It Totalled That On The Invoice But We Still Had To Work Out Between Our Party Who Had What. This Took Us Over An Hour On The Sunday Morning And Was Not A Good Way To End What Had Been A Pleasant Break. The Attitude Was That If We Wanted Drinks Allocating In This Way Then We Should Have Asked But We Had Thought That Drinks And Individual Deposits Had Been Allocated To Rooms And If Any Different  We Should Have Been Asked How We Would Like The Bill At The Outset. We Asked Fort The Service Charge To Be Removed Because Of This Inconvenience.,,,Female,35-44,Hailey Shaw,,,,,,,,,,,Special Offers,... Please Select The Box

I Think They Were Poorly Trained  And Not Enough Staff Were Planned To Be At The Right Place At The Right Time. So I Paid The Service Charge  And Hope It Goes To The Right People.,Improve Window Fitting - I Know It's A Listed Building But There Must Be Improvements Possible - Secondary Glazing?
