,5,No.,,,,,
,10,The People At Reception Are Extremely Helpful And Courteous.,,,,,
,12,Every Member Of Staff Were Friendly And Knowledgable.  It Was Really Nice To Feel Like Everyone Knew Who We Were And What They Are Doing For Us.  I Particularly Liked Laura Who Was Above And Beyond Helpful.  Thank You,,,,,
,13,It Was A Shame There Was Some Construction Taking Place On The 2 Floor But It Didn't Take Away The Great Service Your Staff Provided.,,,,,
,16,Perfect Location   Perfect Service . Only One Thing   We Though That Breakfast Will Include With Room Rate Both Barter Room And Paid Room.Bu Overall Is Very Good.,,,,,
,20,Fantastic Service  The Concierge Remembered What Room We Were In After Only Giving Him The Key Once. The Cocktails At The Bar Were Also Excellent.,,,,,
,21,None,,,,,
,25,Appreciate Everything I Stated In The Pre-Arrival Form Was Followed Through And That The Concierge Was Very Helpful With The Restaurant Booking.,,,,,
,26,Arrival Was Great. I Was Greeted And My Bags Were Taken To My Room Promptly. Was A Very Smooth Arrival.,,,,,
,31,Upon Arrival  My Husband Was Kindly Allowed An Early Check-In  Which Was Really Helpful As We Had A Tired 2-Year Old Toddler In Tow. We Also Appreciated The Pre-Arrival Checklist Sent Via Email Which Ensured We Had Everything We Needed In The Room Upon Arrival. Check-Out Was Handled Similarly Seamlessly.,,,,,
,33,None,,,,,
,37,Yes The Concierge Team Were Excellent  Bruno  Guillaum And George Especially.,,,,,
,38,I Absolutely Loved Stayed With You And Will Recommend To Anyone Coming To London.  It Was A Lovely Experience And Cannot Thank You Enough.,,,,,
,40,This Was A Complimentary Visit Awarded By The Telegraph That I Gave To My Daughter Charlotte And Her Husband To Stay At On Their Wedding Anniversary.  They Had A Lovely Time And Said The Staff Were Excellent And Always Remembered Their Names.  They Only Wish They Could Stay At The Capital Whenever They Visit London.  Elizabeth Clewett For Charlotte Lockyer,,,,,
,51,Firm Pillows In The Room  Very Important,,,,,
,54,Absolutely. All The Staff Are More Then Excellent!! You Feel At Home.,,,,,
,59,Not Really Just Everyone Very Helpful Efficient And Friendly.,,,,,
,60,No - Perfect All Round  Thank You!,,,,,
,63,That Was My Second Stay At The Capital. Both Times I Have Flown From Perth And Arrived At The Hotel At 7Am And Both Times They Have Managed To Get Me An Early Check In Which I Have Been Super Pleased With. The Only Thing I Would Say That Is Slightly Negative Is That My Room Wasn't Very Sound Proof - There Were A Few Guys Fiddling Around Outside My Room And I Could Hear Them Very Clearly Which I Didnt Like. Apart From That It Was Excellent And The Staff Were Incredibly Accommodating And Friendly. Will Defintiely Stay Again!,,,,,
,65,It Was A Very Pleasant Experience  Quick  Courteous And Made Us Feel Very Welcome -Thank You,,,,,
,66,There Was No Doorman Which Made Us Feel Unwelcome.,,,,,
,70,No,,,,,
,74,We Were Woken Up At 8Am By Workmen Our Stay With You Was To Get A Rest From Children  I Think On Booking I Should Of Been Informed We Could Be Disturbed As I Would Of Chosen Another Hotel On This Occasion.,,,,,
,80,I Contacted You Several Times Before Our Stay As I Had Some Pretty Specific Requests For My Husbands 60Th Birthday Surprise Visit. Jenifer Souza And Cesar Were Wonderful  Calling Me To Ask Questions And Making Recommendations.,,,,,
,82,The Staff Were Very Welcoming And Helpful Upon Arrival  Especially The Doorman. Being Really Picky  I Could Ask If You Need To Have 2 Desks In The Lobby  As Which One To Go To Was Not Immediately Clear. Please Do Not Take This As A Criticism  Merely An Observation!,,,,,
,84,A Very Warm And Homely Experience Only Wish I Could Of Stayed Longer,,,,,
,85,We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Hotel Service And Loved The Location - With Easy Access To Other Parts Of The City.,,,,,
,88,Thanks We Had A Great Time And Felt Home In The Appartment,,,,,
,89,No,,,,,
,91,I Was Expecting More Flexibility Regarding Late Check Out As We Were Traveling With Baby. Else Everything Was Perfect,,,,,
,95,Front Desk Staff Wasn't Particularly Pleasant. She Seemed Annoyed That We Were Distracted At Assuring Out Luggage Made It In As Our Driver Could Not Park At The Entrance To The Hotel. Our Options For Breakfast Were Not Clearly Explained As We Learned Their Were 2 Breakfast Type Offered. We Learned Later That Both Options Were Included In Our Reservations.,,,,,
,105,No One Came To Help With Luggage,,,,,
,107,We Have Stayed In Your Hotel Since 2000 And Find Staff Very Polite And Helpful. With Our Business Of Horse Racing Sometimes We Need To Drop And Go Or Arrive Late For Which Your Staff Are Always Helpful And Accommodating   We Love The Friendly And Familiar Faces,,,,,
,111,Coming To The Capital  Is Somehow Coming Home In London !,,,,,
,115,Many Thanks For Upgrade,,,,,
,117,I Noticed That The Staff Is Not So Friendly With Each Others,,,,,
,118,The Concierge Staff Are Fantastic!,,,,,
,122,As Always Very Good,,,,,
,125,I Am Not Mr Richardson.  I Am Divorced So I Would Call Myself Ms I Guess. But Its Easy To Make This Mistake But Its Important I Feel That You Know That There Are Women Who Travel Alone And Maybe With A Daughter As I Did. I Am Not Offended It Happens Often. But Society Is Changing A Lot And Women Do Travel Alone. The Arrival Was Very Well Attended For. I Was Made Most Welcome  Thank You.,,,,,
,126,It Would Have Been Nice If They Had Explained That You Could Leave Your Room Key At The Front When Going Out.  My Husband Felt Uncomfortable When He Was Approached On The Way Out  That He Should Turn In His Key.  He Almost Felt Scolded.,,,,,
,127,The Room Key Should Be Smaller And More Convenient To Carry. The Reception Area Is Small  Cozy And Well Organized And Functional.,,,,,
,128,As Always Your Hotel Feels Like Our Home When We Are With You  We Feel Welcome And Very Comfy  Food And Wine And Service Is Excellent.,,,,,
,129,Graham Remembered Us From Previous Stays And Was Very Welcoming.,,,,,
,132,We Recently Made A Reservation At The Capital And Had A Late Change Of Plans And Had To Cancel. The Telephone And Email Contact I Had Was Very Understanding - Especially As The Concierge Had Also Made Some Restaurant Bookings And Had To Cancel These Too.,,,,,
,134,Always A Nice Greeting And It's Lovely To Just Jump Out Of The Car And Leave It To Be Parked.,,,,,
,139,To Me Personally  The Welcoming Was A Little Too Much. One Person 'Grabbing' My Handbagage (With Laptop)  Which I Rather Would Have Kept  Next Person Welcoming Me And Third Person Doing Check-In - All Within 10 Square Meters.  Also  Again Very Personal  Don't Need To Be Accompanied Upstairs.,,,,,
,140,Excellent  Personal Welcome - Very Professional From The Moment I Walked In.  Thank You.,,,,,
,141,Evverything Was Very Efficient  Friendly & Professional.  All Staff Are Very Helpful.,,,,,
,142,Better Broadband For Business Guests,,,,,
,145,It Was Our First Time Staying At The Hotel After Signing Up With Slh Club. It Was Suppose To Give Us An Automatic Upgrade And/Or Free Breakfast. We Did Not Received That. We Took Two Rooms  With 4 People. At Least 2 Person Breakfast Or Room Upgrade Would Be Great. Appreciate If This Could Be Accorded At Our Next Stay.,,,,,
,146,Yes  The Wi-Fi Is Poor. It Is Achingly Slow At 125Kb/S And Really Not Competitive With The Offerings From Your Competition In Londom. It Is Time The Capital Moved Into The Modern Age And Replaced It's Vendor With A Much Faster Offering. If The Current Situation Continues  I Will Be Forced To Change My Hotel As The Capital Is Not Meeting The Grade For Business Level Communications.,,,,,
,150,Very Good Hotel With High Quality Service And Well-Trained Staff,,,,,
,153,Everything Was Perfect.,,,,,
,155,Very Helpful With Booking.,,,,,
,156,Room Was Not Ready As Arrived Early Was Offered A Room That Was Ready But Told Would Have To Pay An Extra Cost Felt Was Being Sold To?,,,,,
,162,It Was Very Refreshing Having Smiling Happy Members Of Staff To Greet Us And In Particular Help Me As I Was On Crutches,,,,,
,165,All Extremely Helpful. Excellent Service,,,,,
,168,No,,,,,
,169,The Arrival Of The Hotel Is Already Bothered By An 'Old' Guy  Dressed In Ancient Cloth And Wearing A Cylinder Hat (He Seems To Be Displaced From The Wrong Century) With Obviously The Only Function To Open The Door. I Wonder Who Is Not Able To Open A Door By Himself. There Are Two Reception Desks And It Is Very Unclear Where To Go To Get What. I Experienced Check-In To Be Very Confusing. Additionally  There Are Too Many Employees Standing Around And Staring. I Missed A Disrete Environment In Which The Customer Is 'King'. My Impression Is  That This Hotel Is Only For People Who Have An Extreme Need Of Service Personnel Around. Also  If I Would Have That Need  I Would Search For A Big Hotel Which Also Has The Room And Infrastructure For An Over-Services Environment. I Felt That The Balance Between Size And Over-Service Of The Hotel Was Not Comfortable.,,,,,
,170,I Dropped My Suitcase Off The Day Before My Stay With Ease.,,,,,
,175,1. Change The Room Key To Cards Eletronic. 2. At Breakfast  I Don't Understand Why Don't Exist Slices Of Cheese Beside The Bread  Example  Emmental; All The Good Hotels Has. 3. Elevators Sounds And Noises So High. 4.,,,,,
,176,The Room I Stayed In Needs Some Renovation,,,,,
,178,Very Slow Internet - Ridiculous For A 5-Star Hotel!,,,,,
,182,Particularly Liked The Email Asking About Any Special Requests/Requirements.,,,,,
,187,1. Negotiate More Vociferously With Zara Over Late Night Construction Work. 2. Install Fretwork Or Other Open Decorative Panel On Door To Cupboard Containing Fridge. It Overheats But Cannot Be Left Open Due To Light And General Inconvenience.  In All Other Respects  Your Hotel Is One Of My Favorite Boutique Style Hotels Worldwide. Thank You! ,,,,,
,188,I Was Slightly Confused By The Fact That The Reception Desk And Concierge Desk Are In The Same Place But Not Identified By Any Sign I Could See - There Was Nobody On Reception  So I Went To The Concierge By Accident.  Small Error On My Part  And Nothing To Worry About,,,,,
,196,Everyone Was Attentive And Helpful.   Hotel Definitely Has The Personal Touch.,,,,,
,199,It Was A Challenge To Understand The Lady Behind Reception And Design Of The Reception 'Cubicle' Combined With The Acoustics Of The Area Did Not Help,,,,,
,200,We Had A Delicious Time   Would Love To Try The Levin Next Door   Our Son Loved It!,,,,,
,202,No  Everything Very Good,,,,,
,203,Didn't Really Like View From Room Onto Goods Yard,,,,,
,206,We Always Receive A Very Warm Welcome And All Of Our Requests Are Masterfully Met.,,,,,
,208,We Were Very Tired From The Long Flight And Our Room Was Not Ready So We Were Directed Into The Bar Area And It Was Very Nice.,,,,,
,209,The Capital Is An Excellent Hotel And The Staff Are Always Very Helpful And Courteous Both On Arrival And Departure.,,,,,
,216,We Felt At Home,,,,,
,218,Just Perfect,,,,,
,219,Graham Was So Very Helpful. Wonderful Concierge Who Goes Above And Beyond The Call Of Duty.,,,,,
,226,It All Went Very Smoothly And Staff Hospitality Was Excellentâ¦,,,,,
,227,We Booked For The Levin But Due To A Flood We Stayed In The Capitol Instead  Feel The Relationship Between Staff At Both Hotels Was Not Particulary Good And There Appeared To Have Issues On Confirming Details Of Our Stay. Overall However  A Great Place To Stay!,,,,,
,230,Very Welcoming Staff,,,,,
,233,My Stay Was Pleasant At The Capital   The Receptionist Liliana Was Very Kind When I Checked In   And During My Stay Every Thing Was Ok   But When Checking Out There Was A Bill Of The Breakfast Charged At The Room When I Payed It Cash Already Not On The Room Account   And A Mistake In Charging On The Mini Bar When I Never Used It. Thats All,,,,,
,234,I Want To Commend In Particular The Concierge,,,,,
,238,As Always  Superb!,,,,,
,240,Everything Was Top Notch. We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay!,,,,,
,242,Hotel  Ambiance And Staff Were Absolutely Lovely  We Felt More Than Welcome!,,,,,
,244,No Comments.  Reception Staff And Doorman Were Friendly And Welcoming.,,,,,
,245,Very Professional Stff With Fine Attention To Detail. Ihave Traveled Extensivelyand Must Rate This As One Of The Best Experiences In Terms Of Service And Hospitallity.,,,,,
,251,I Didnot Get The Room I Booked  It Was A Smaller One  Maybe The Reason Was That I Asked For 2 Separate Beds  I Was With A Colleqea. I Went To The Reception And I Have Paid Sterling 96 Extra To Get A Better Room. That Was A Little Disappointment To Start.,,,,,
,253,All Responses Were Quick And Efficient.,,,,,
,258,Just To Say Thank You Very Much For Helping Us With Our Stay.  The Children Really Enjoyed It.  Fyi And I Hope This Is Helpful...... The Tv In The Sitting Room Did Not Have The Channels Available That Were On The Tvs In The Bedrooms.  This Was A Little Frustrating Once Children Were In Bed.   Some Of The Kitchen Utensils Were Broken And No Corkscrew?  Staff Are Wonderful And Really Helpful.  Thank You Again To You And The Team At The Capital.,,,,,
,259,Genuinely Friendly And Helpful Staff- This Is A Real Differentiator From Other Hotels,,,,,
,267,Very Professional But Warm And Friendly Too. Excellent Job.,,,,,
,273,Always A Very Warm Welcome,,,,,
,275,Your Staff Are Delightful And Are A Credit To The Hotel.,,,,,
,277,Staff Was Great  Particularly The Young Frenchman (Who's Name I Forget) Who Helped Us With Everything.,,,,,
,278,Clive Was Very Helpful When I Contacted Him Prior To Our Arrival. I Liked Receiving The Message Offering Assistance.,,,,,
,281,It Is Very Helpful To Me When Arriving Early In The Morning From Hong Kong To Be Able To Get Access To My Room - Which The Capital Usually Does,,,,,
,284,We Thank You For The Upgrade Of The Room  It Was A Nice Surprice,,,,,
,286,We Were Surprised To Be Charged Â£48 For The Bottle Of Levin Wine  As Is Was Understood By Me That This Was A Complementary Seasonal Offer. The Wording Was Misleading.,,,,,
,290,I Have Completed Another Online Survey Which Covers These Questions,,,,,
,291,As Part Of The Check In Procedure We Were Offered An Upgrade For An Additional Fee.At This Stage In The Day It Would Be Better Not To Mention It Or Offer The Upgrade Complimentary .It Would Have Been A Surprise And Delight Rether Than Comming Accross As A Revenue Generating Idea.,,,,,
,297,Concierge On Duty When We Were There ( English Guy ) Was Exceptional In Every Respect ....One Of The Best,,,,,
,306,I Really Missed Having My Own Tea/Coffee Maker In The Room - I Need To Drink Frequently And Often Late At Night !!!!,,,,,
,309,When I Am In London I Only Stay At The Capital Hotel. The Great Staff That You Have Are A Credit To You All. They Always Make Me Feel Most Welcome And Never Forget My Name - Which Is Excellent. I Had An Early Morning Check In As I Arrived From Australia. As Soon As I Arrived Your Staff Welcomed Me And Escorted Me To My Room Which Was Wonderful After A Long Flight.,,,,,
,311,Loved It As Always - Did The Tripadvisor Thing Today - So Thank You So Much!,,,,,
,312,It Is Important That Your Phone Booking Staff Know The Various Deals Etc You Have On At Any Particular Time. My Wife Had Rung (She Doesn't Use A Computer)Asking If We Could Book A Deal You Had On The Internet And Were Told That It Didn't Include Vat Which It Clearly Did. Because Of This  We Didn't Book And Had Decided To Go Elsewhere. As We Both Love The Capital  She Rang Again The Next Day And The Person Acknowledged The Deal And She Booked A Suite For Two Nights. I Can't Recall The Exact Details But The Internet Junior Suite Rate Was 450 A Night And The First Staff Member Would Only Take The Booking At 450 Plus Vat Which We Understandably Rejected. Even Though We Only Stay 2-4 Nights A Year  We Have Sent A Lot Of Friends To Your Hotel So I Think It's Crazy To Loose A Customer Over Such A Simple Matter (Especially When At The Time In Question  A Number Of Your Staff Said Bookings Were Light). After All That  We Really Enjoyed Our Stay!,,,,,
,314,It Is Always A Pleasure To Stay At The Capital -- I Consider It My 'London Home'!,,,,,
,315,Cesear The Bartender Is Second To None.  He Is An Asset To The Capital.,,,,,
,316,Due To A Problem With The Toilet In Our Room  We Were Moved To Another (Larger) Room Which Was Very Nice  Save For A Lack Of Storage (Drawer Space). This Was Rectified Quickly By Bringing In A Dresser With Four Large Drawers. We Very Much Appreciated The Effort - And The Added Storage Space! We Truly Enjoy Staying At The Capitol  Both For Location And The Ambiance And Staff. Thank You!,,,,,
,318,We Booked A Deluxe Room As We Understood That All Deluxe Rooms Are Towards Basil Street  But Instead We Got A Room Towards The Courtyard. However  We Were Relocated Into A Room Towards Basil Street After Our Complaint. The Rooms Are Beautifullu Decorated Everything Is Clean And Good Except Bathrooms That Acc. To Us Need A Refurbishment. We Are Still Happy To Recommend The Capital Hotel.,,,,,
,319,All Very Positive...Excellent Service And Responsiveness,,,,,
,320,Excellent Contact With All Personnel. Really Friendly And Professional. Bravo!,,,,,
,326,I Thought The Staff Were Wonderful  Very Helpful And Courteous  And The Accommodations Were Excellent  As Was The Food.,,,,,
,327,I Had Booked Into The Levin  But Was Met At Its Door By A Staff Member Who'd Been Waiting For Me To Tell Me I Was Being Moved To The Capital (Not A Problem For Me  But A Bonus). There Had  It Seems  Been An Issue With The Room I Was Due To Occupy. The Welcome Was Excellent And I Was Made To Feel Like A Special Guest (Even Though I Was Not).,,,,,
,330,1. Noisy When Slamming Doors To The Rooms.  2. Always Burning Ourselves As The Towel-Heater Is To Near The Toilet 3. Need To Re-Make The Bath Tubs  4. Need To Face-Lift The Sone Around The Toiets At Behind The Reception And The Toilets,,,,,
,333,I Feel At Home !!,,,,,
,335,Every Stay So Far Was Excellent!,,,,,
,337,Please  Continue To Be Soooo Friendly ! I Liked It And Made A Recommendation In Trip Advisor . Thank You !,,,,,
,338,On Previous Questionairre Mentioned That We Were Asked The Reason For Our Visit -I Felt This Was An Invasion Of Privacy. No Mini-Bar Key On Room Key. 2 People Were At The Desk When We Checked In -One Appeared To Be A Trainee-The Other Individual ? Manager Never Looked At Us Nor Smiled -I Felt This Was Appalling..,,,,,
,339,The Arrival Was A S Delightful As Though I Were Known And Liked .,,,,,
,342,I Feel That The Staff Remember Me From Previous Visits So That As A Solo Visitor   I Immediately Feel Welcome And Comfortable.,,,,,
,343,No It Is Like Coming Home,,,,,
,349,Excellent In All Respects  I Will Stay When I Come To London,,,,,
,351,As Always Nice And Friendly As From  The Door Man Onwards !,,,,,
,352,Very Professional But Friendly  You're Made To Feel Very Welcome  Good Experience,,,,,
,354,Request For A Blu Ray Dvd Player Could Not Be Met As Hotel Did Not Have One. Considering They Can Be Bought For As Little As Â£100 I Felt That For This Hotel That Was A Minus.,,,,,
,356,My Wife And I Were Very Comfortable In Our Junior Suite And We Enjoyed Our Stay Very Much,,,,,
,358,My First Call Was At The Capital Apartments   The 2 Bedroom   Where I Stayed For A Week. That Was Very Good  Modern Bathrooms  Excellent Service From All Staff. Second Call Was A Night At Capital Hotel Which I Didnt Care For In Particular The Bathrooms. I Would Return If The Rooms Were More Contemporary And Modern Bathrooms Like In The Apartment Side.,,,,,
,361,The Hotel Need To Think About Upgrading The Bathrooms. The Fixtures Are Old. Also You Need To Upgrade The Air-Conditioning System,,,,,
,365,We Were Very Happy And The Hotel Personel Made Our Stay Very Confortable..... Thank You.,,,,,
,367,No,,,,,
,370,When Phoning To Book I Was Put On Hold For Several Minutes Which I Found A Bit Odd,,,,,
,372,The Gluten Free Bread Was The Best I've Tasted In 20 Years Of Being A Coeliac. Outlaws Was Also A Great Food Experience. Best Of All I Felt As Comfortable At Your Hotel As I Do In My Own Home. The Room I Stayed In Also Seemed To Be Geared To The Comfort Of The Female Gender Down To The Satin Covered Coat Hangers.,,,,,
,376,Rooms As Usual In London Small  Bathroom Very Nice Fantastic Staff (Clive) Relatively Pricey Compared To Similar Hotels,,,,,
,377,Email Correspondence Was Excellently Handled And Helpful. On Our Arrival The Staff Were Friendly And Extremely Helpful In A Most Courteous Manner.,,,,,
,378,We Pre Contacted You By Phone To Confirm That A Room Was Available  As On Our Last Visit We Were Moved To The Levin On Arrival. We Were Extremely Disappointed With This At The Time And Did Think That We Would Not Return. However We Decided To Book Again And Wanted To Make Sure That A Room Was Available At The Capital For This Visit.,,,,,
,381,Hope To See You Next Time,,,,,
,382,Just Ended Up With A Bad Room. Had Not Been To The Capital For Several Years But Frequented The Hotel Often In The Past. Love Clive  Chris And Graham. They Are The Real Reason I Returned.,,,,,
,385,It Was Our Great Pleasure To Spend Four Nights With You. Felt Most Welcome And A Perfect End To A Five Week Holiday,,,,,
,388,I Was Traveling With My Elderly Mother And Your Hotel And Staff Made Our Visit Extremely Pleasurable In Every Way  Even Providing A Kettle And Tea Makings For My Mother's Nocturnal Cuppa.,,,,,
,389,Extremely Friendly And Accommodating Staff  Distinguished And Polite  A Pleasure To Be Welcomed This Way,,,,,
,390,All Staff Were Very Welcoming And Helpful In Every Way.,,,,,
,398,Staff Very Helpful With Questions Prior To Arrival,,,,,
,401,My Opera Ticket Was Waiting And Clive Managed To Get Me A Good Seat At The Cheapest Price.  All The Staff Were Warm And Friendly.  Plus The Capital Is In Such A Great Location.  Harrods As The Corner Shop.  Kensington Tube Worked In Well For Me (Female) Going On My Own To The Coliseum In The Evening - Direct Line Only Three Stops. Â£7 For An All Day Ticket.,,,,,
,403,Very Efficient Questions Answered Timely Excursions Arranged Before Our Arrival,,,,,
,405,Very Helpful,,,,,
,407,Always Very Happy With All Aspect Of The Capital.,,,,,
,408,I Have Stayed At The Capital Hotel Now For 15 Years. In London  Is Is Assuredly My Home-Away-From-Home.,,,,,
,410,We Have Stayed At The Capital On Other Occasions  The Staff Are Excellent  Even Down To The Doormen  When They Take You Car  And Welcome You,,,,,
,420,All Of The E-Mail Correspondance Was Very Welcoming And Solicitous Of Our Potential Needs. Very Well Done. Upon Arrival Your People Were Immediately Welcoming And Engaging In A Most Pleasant Way.,,,,,
,424,It Was Very Noisy With The Alterations Going On But We Know They Are Necessary.....Think It Might Have Been Mentioned When We Booked.,,,,,
,431,We Partiularly Appreciated Attention Given To Us By The 'Head Porter',,,,,
,433,Graham Gave Us A Great Welcome. As Usual He Was A Bit Cheeky But My Wife Loves That!,,,,,
,434,I Made My Reservation About Two Weeks In Advance Of My Visit And Requested Email Confirmation  This Only Arrived Two Days Before I Visited: I Feel That I Should Have Had It As Soon As I Made The Reservation,,,,,
,436,We Detected An Air Of Desperation. We Were Told That A Suite Was Available That Would Cost Â£150 More Than Our Booked Room. We Said  Fine  Upgrade Us But At No Cost! We Have Steay At Th Capital Often Over The Years So We Didn't Think This Was A Request Too Cheeky. It's Not What The Staff Were Proposing However. We Also Were Told That A Table In The Drawing Room Was Still Available For Valentine's Day Evening -- A Sales Effort. We Had Already Made Other Arrangements  The Special Menu At Outlaw's Not Having Appealed To Us. Also We Were Not Asked About A Newspaper So Naturally We Didn't Receive One  Although We Would Have Liked A Newspaper.,,,,,
,437,I Believe A Check Should Be Made When Booking To Take Into Account Specials Advertised At The Time Of Booking. A Room Was Booked At A Rate Only To Discover A Flyer Advertising Rooms At A Cheaper Rate At The Same Time. Further Inquiries Into That Resulted In A Cheaper Rate Being Quoted.,,,,,
,438,We Requested Room 234 But Were Not  Given That Room.  The Room We Had 634 Felt Small And Cramped And The Decor Needed To Be Redone.  We Do Love The Hotel But Don T Like The New Restaurant And Won T Eat There Until It Has Changed.   There Was A Constant Noise In Our Room Of Air Ducts In Both Bathrooms.  We Have Stayed In The Capital For Six Years Now And Love The Staff But Were Disappointed On Our Last Two Visits.  If We Have One More Disappointing Stay..We Will Have To Think Again.  Sorry To Be So Negative But This Is How We Have Found It .  Yours  Mr. And Ms. Strange,,,,,
,442,The Only Problem Was With The Heating System. On Wednesday It Just Produced Cold Air. I Rang For Assistance Buth The Chap Who Came Could Not Resolve The Problem,,,,,
,446,The Doorman Was Very Helpful And Attended To Every Request Which I Made .,,,,,
,451,All Contact Pre And Arrival Dealt With Very Professionally.,,,,,
,452,I Wish To Give High Praise To Liliana And Others With Whom Worked Before The Visit Is Coordinating The Details Of My Wife's Gluten-Free Dietary Requirements. She And The Others Not Only Communicated In A Most Professional Manner  But Followed-Up Impeccably. ,,,,,
,453,All To My Liking,,,,,
,457,Your Staff Make The Place. They Do A Great Job.,,,,,
,458,Lived For Several Years Near The Capital  Dined There Often  So Know It Much Better Than My Modest Stay Record Would Reflect. Would Of Course Recommend To Good Friends.,,,,,
,459,There Was A Mix Up On Our Arrival Departure Dates But Was Quickly Sorted Out.,,,,,
,465,It Started Almost Immediately When Greeted And Helped By Your Doorman. He Was So Nice. But Also The Other Staff Members Were Really Nice And Helpfull.,,,,,
,467,Always Love Arriving At The Capital - We Are Given The Feeling That We Are 'The Most Important People There' And That We Are At Home And With Friends. Nothing Is Ever Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,472,Can't Wait To Come Back!!!!,,,,,
,474,Bar And Bar Food Very Good  Cesar Very Good,,,,,
,475,Staff Excellent But Room 228 A Bit Tired & Very Noisy,,,,,
,478,We Came For Mothers 95Th Birthday   And I Must Say Everything Was Wonderfull  Even The Weather  Your Staff Are Excellent  We All Had A Fab Time. Nesta Phipps.,,,,,
,479,I Had A Problem With Initial Web Booking Which I Think Was Operator Error!! I Immediately Telephoned To Make A  Change In Dates Which Was Handled With Charm And Tact  However When I Telephoned 5 Days Before Arriving To Check All Was Ok There Was Considerable Confusion  Yet Again Dates Seemed To Be Wrong  The Person To Whom I Spoke Did Subsequently Agree That The Dates I Had Reserved Were Good And Promised To Confirm By Email  She Didn't.,,,,,
,485,A Make Mirror In Bathroom Would Be Nice,,,,,
,486,The Staff Is Delightful.  Very Helpful And Gracious.,,,,,
,487,You Guys Are The Best. You Run A Great Show...And Lorena Somera Is 'Top Of The Heap'!,,,,,
,488,Some Of Your Public Areas Are Very Cramped;E.G.At Breakfast The Distances Between Tables Are Very Limited And One Can Easily Knock Something Off An Other Table; Also I Had A Snack In The Bar Before Departing For The Train And My Legs Were Squeezed Sideways Into A Very Narrow And Uncomfortable Position.,,,,,
,489,The Capital Continues To Provide A Very Welcoming And Comfortable Experience,,,,,
,491,As Two Widows Travelling Together We Felt Very Comfortable  Safe And Well Taken Care Of ... Besides The Accomodations  We Loved The Locations.  Definitely Wwould Recommend And Stay Again.  All Of The Staff  From Bell Boy To Waiter/Waitress Staff Wonderful! ... Especially Enjooyed The Truffles!,,,,,
,493,Room Looking A Little Tatty. Silly Shower Control Very Hard To Regulate. If You Give Fruit (Which Is A Nice Touch) You Should Update The Platter Daily Otherwise I Feel It Works Against You.,,,,,
,497,Everyone Was Friendly And Tried To Make My Stay A Pleasant One,,,,,
,499,We Loved The Small Boutique Hotel Atmosphere  The Room Amenities And The Courtesy And Helpfulness Of All Your Staff.  Your Location Is Ideal For A Visit To London.,,,,,
,504,Hotel Is Not Value For Money   I Can Stay In The Berkley For The Same Price   Entrance Is Old And Needs Referb   To Be Confronted By You Reception Desk And The Partition In Front Is Not Welcome   I Had To Register On The Side   Bar Area Is Tired And Needs Referb Its A Blast From The 60S   Sofas To Narrow To Sit On   Chair Backs Damaged   Staff To Bussie Doing Room Service   To Serve Drinks   Not Asked If We Would Like Another    Booked The Restarant But Decided Not To Eat With You .  The Room We Were Given 223 Was  Is In Need Of Referb   Very Small Room And Sad .  Bathroom Was Even Worse 6' X 6' Approx   Bath Was Old And Had Come Away From The Tiles   A Re-Seal Job Had Been Done   Very Bad   The Enamel Was Off And Very Rough Surface When In The Bath To Sit On .  Toilet Had A Cracked Pan . Not A New Crack . Seat Was Damaged And Blown With Water ? Stayed With You 3 Nights .  Would Rather Stay In A B/B Than Return .,,,,,
,506,No.,,,,,

,508,Clive Took Excellent Care Of Our Pickup At Heathrow.,,,,,
,509,From Chris The Doorman To Graham And Clive Always Agreat Welcome,,,,,
,516,Everything Was Perfect,,,,,
,518,No  We Were Well Received By All Of Your Staff In The Reception Area And Your Concierge Services And Professionalism Were Excellent.,,,,,
,519,Did You Find Any Belongings Left Behind I.E. Man's Hat-Umbrella-Small Gift-Doll,,,,,
,523,We Didn't Stay At The Hotel. We Had A Lunch Party For 10 People In Eaton. Laura Was Very Helpful Indeed In The Planning Over Several Months And On The Day She And Francesca Provided Outstanding Good Service At The Table.,,,,,
,528,The Pressure To Take Our Luggage Out Of The Room  Prior To Our Departure At 12Am  Was The Only Negative Remark Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,535,No,,,,,
,536,No,,,,,
,539,I Would Love To Return With My Other Grandchildren.  We Had A Very Wonderful Stay.,,,,,
,541,My  Late Night  Arrival Was Expected And I Was Given A Warm Welcome.,,,,,
,550,We Just Had A Great Stay.  The Service Was Superb.,,,,,
,573,Excellent Service Throughout My Stay  Always Fely Most Welcome. I Will Be Sending A Follow Up E-Mail To Management To Thank Them For A Wonderful Stay.,,,,,
,576,We Felt The Restaurant Was Not As Good As We Found On Our First And Second Visits Although Breakfast Was Excellent,,,,,
,580,The One Thing That I Was Very Surprised About During Our Last Stay Was The Way In Which The Package Was Put Together.  During My Telephone Booking I Requested Parking And Was Told It Was Â£40 And To Include A Bottle Of Champagne Due To The Seasonal Offer.  Upon Arrival I Was Offered Red Or White Wine And Duly Accepted The White   Only To Discover That It Was Charged To Our Account In The Sum Of Â£48   Plus The Usual Parking Fee.  I Felt That This Was Unfair  As We Had Not Mentioned Wine  And We're Misled In Regards To Why It Was Being Offered .,,,,,
,582,We Were Dissapointed To Be Charged For The Wine Sent To Our Room As It Was Offered To Us And Was Our Understanding  That It Was Complimentary As Part Of The Seasonal Offer .  We Would Not Have Accepted At A Tariff Of Â£48.  It Was Very Misleading.,,,,,
,589,I Have Been Staying At The Capital For Several Years Now Both For Business And For Pleasure With My Family When Visiting London And We Could Not Be More Pleased With The Staff  Their Professionalism  Their Detail To Service And Of Course Their Friendliness.  The Hotel Itself Has A Special Ambience And Personality  Quite Different Than The Larger Hotels In The City.  We Are Extremely Happy To Be Part Of The Capital's Family.,,,,,
,593,Room And Bath Was Perfect Clean Up.,,,,,
,602,Miss Old Restaurant  Breakfast List It's Magic And Really Don't Like Newly Refurbished Rooms Very White And Hospital Like,,,,,
,610,I Filled In This Questionnaire Yesterday  But Omitted To Mention That On Arrival  There Was Some Confusion Because The Booking Had Not  Apparently  Been Confirmed. This Was Because The Confirmatory Email Had Not Been Received By Me Due To The Incorrect Email Address Being Used. It Was Sent To Iam@Aeho.Co.Uk When It Should Have Been To Ian@Aeho.Co.Uk. Bearing In Mind My First Name Is Ian  I Was Surprised That This Error Had Been Made And Gave A Rather Poor First Impression.,,,,,
,611,-On Arrival  A Client Checking In Was So Engaged In  ' Interrogating' The Receptionist That She Should Have Called Someone Else To Check Us In As We Were Unnecessarily  Kept Waiting,,,,,
,612,Whoever Checks The Bookings Is V Efficient And Spotted I Had Booked A Gourmet Package In Both Nights And Sorted It All Out For Me,,,,,
,613,Excellent Greeting On Arrival  Bedroom Had No Dressing Table,,,,,
,614,Our Room Was Not Ready Upon Our Arrival  So We Had To Wait @ 1 Hour Before Being Able To Freshen Up Following A 12 Hour Flight.,,,,,
,648,Although I Confirmed My Booking Through Booking.Com  I Received An Email From The Hotel The Night Before My Arrival Asking For My Credit Card Details. Due To Information Security Procedure  I Couldn't Provide Such Information. I Recommend That The Hotel Change Its Policy And Avoid Asking Its Client To Send Such Sensitive Information Via Email.,,,,,
,650,I Was Not Recognised As A Former Guest.,,,,,
,651,We Were Dealt With In A Very Professional Friendly Way.,,,,,
,654,Excellent Welcome Very Organised But Friendly,,,,,
,659,Room Was Not Ready On Arrival. I Was Upgraded But Was Late For An Engagement.,,,,,
,660,Advised Of Early Arrival But Didn't Get Room Until 1Pm,,,,,
,666,Great Location/  Air Conditioner Wasn't Great,,,,,
,667,Kate Was Charming And Attentive.  Also Appreciated Graheme's Assistance,,,,,
,676,No,,,,,
,682,None,,,,,
,683,I Love Staying At The Capital  And This Year I Stayed For Two And A Half Month. I Must Say The Staff Is Great  Friendly And Helpful. There Are A Few Down Sides Which You Should Consider. The Towels In The Apartment Are Tired And Should Be Replaced. The Cleaning Staff Is Not Fantastic  And I Had To Do My Own Dusting Regularly. The Carpet Next To The Bed Must Be Cleaned! The Noise  In The Street Is Appalling.,,,,,
,685,Sir I M Mubasher From Mubasher Travel Alain Uae. This Guest Saeed Sultan Alkhyeli Is A My Best Client And My Friend. Every Year In August May Be More Than 10 Customer Go To London And They Want Capital But I Did Not Find.All Customer Need 15 To 20Nights.  Raimubasher@Hotmail.Com,,,,,
,689,No Comment,,,,,
,695,You May Want To Check  But Extractor Fan In Bathroom Not Working (Rm 221) But I Am Deaf!,,,,,
,697,I Don't Understand Why The Women At The Front Are Not Capable Of Answering Simple Questions. They Constantly Refer To The Concierge Who Often Was Not Reachable. Your Staff Did Not Seem As 'Quick' As They Were A Couple Of Years Ago.,,,,,
,710,We Did Ring To Confirm That You Had A Room Available   As On Our Last Visit To The Capital We Were Told You Were In Act Full And We Were Put Into The Levin   We Were Extremely Disappointed With This And This Time Made Sure That We Would Be In The Capital Hotel,,,,,
,713,We Asked For Musikal Tickets And That Was Perfect,,,,,
,714,No,,,,,
,732,The Room You Gave Me Did Not Match The Descriptiã³n Or The Price,,,,,
,742,I Did Not Know That The Two Bedroom Suite Were Next Door And I Wish I Had Known That. Neither Did I Know That It Was On The Second Floor With Bedrooms Facing Backyard. When I First Booked My Rooms I Requested Rooms On The 4Th Or 5Th Floor Facing Basil Street Because Of The Noice In The Mornings From The Service Cars.,,,,,
,743,All Excellent.,,,,,
,747,The Space Is Not Comfortable In The Room,,,,,
,755,We Love The Capital And The Staff!,,,,,
,760,Keep Up The Good Work,,,,,
,766,I Love The Service But The Hotel Itself Is Just Ugly  Especially The Bathrooms.,,,,,
,767,Breakfast Could Be Better!,,,,,
,768,There Was A Misunderstanding With My Reservation  Mainly My Problem  But No Charge Was Made. That Was Good Customer Service
,,,,,
,770,Staff Was Friendly  But Busy With Other Clients  So I Waited For A While Before Being Served,,,,,
,771,All Very Satisfactory,,,,,
,775,Good,,,,,
,776,N/A,,,,,
,781,Just Fabulous And Felt At Home!,,,,,
,783,Original E.Mail Confirmation Of The Booking Did Not Arrive Owing To The Lack Of Understanding By Reception Lady Of My British Accent  And She Used The Incorrect E.Mail Address Originally.,,,,,
,787,For Me It's Best Hotel In London 
Brilliant Staf 
,,,,,
,792,We Filled Out A Pre-Arrival Form Stating Arrival 1300 Hrs
No Negative Response   But Had To Wait Almost One Hour In The Bar  Before Room Was Available !!!!,,,,,
,793,Adile Is Fantastic Lady She Organised Everything Smoothly For Us
Many Thanks
To Her,,,,,
,798,The Sherry At Reception Looked Very Tempting But Was It Available ?,,,,,
,807,The Reception Staff Were Very Helpful  Upgrading Our Room Category To A Room To More Adequately Allow For My Wife's Disabilities.,,,,,
,808,Your Doorman And Concierge Never Forget My Name  They Are Attentive And Extremely Helpful  From Loading My Car  To Delivering Shopping To My Room  Fantastic Service And This Is Why I Come Back To You  My Husband Wasnt Able To Make Ti This Weekend And Felt They Took Even More Care Of Me  Thank You.,,,,,
,812,Успехов И Процветания,,,,,
,813,We Love Staying At The Capital. We Stay At Christmas Time (Shopping). The Staff Take Our Parcels  Put Them Into Our Car For Us. Your Doorman Chris Is Excellent. We Know Each Other From Previous Years. The French Guy G At The Concierge Is Equally Pleasant.,,,,,
,814,All Very Good And Relaxing  We Have Had Many Afternoon Teas And This Was Among The Best. ,,,,,
,818,As Always We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome.  I Have Stayed With You On 3 Other Occasions But This Was My Husbands First Time. He Agreed Its A Great Hotel And We Will Return Our Next Time In London Which Is Scheduled For Around End Of Jan As It's My Husbands Birthday.  Also The Complimentary Fruit Basket And Champagne Was A Lovely Touch As It Was My Birthday. Thanks Again.  I Will Leave A Review On Trip Advisor And Facebook.,,,,,
,820,All My Requests Eg Box Of Chocolates In My Daughter's Room  Pillows And Blankets  Restaurant Reservation Etc Were Carried Out With Great Care And I Felt That Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Your Staff. We Were Welcomed By Everyone Including The Housekeeping Staff Who Were Going About There Duties.,,,,,
,821,Pleased.,,,,,
,825,Laura Who I Dealt With Was Very Efficient And Went Out Of Her Way To Make Me Feel The Day Would Go Smoothly. Professional And Kind.,,,,,
,827,Staff Was Efficient And Friendly.  One Of Our Two Rooms Was Not Yet Ready  However  We Were Escorted To The One That Was Where We We Could Relax And Wait For The Other To Be Prepared.,,,,,
,830,Staff At Reception Were Very Good.,,,,,
,832,Thank You For Accommodating Us Early.,,,,,
,834,Staff Excellent- Enjoyed The Bar And The Food

,Total Responses:,304,,,,,
,Not Answered:,0,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,
,2,If Any  The Noise Of The Air-Conditioner Is A Little Bit Loud.,,,,,
,5,Wifi Is A Bit Slow And No Comb Is A Bit Inconvenient But Everything Else Are All Fine.,,,,,
,9,Though I Could Connect To The Internet It Didn't Actually Work  Though I Wasn't In The Bedroom Enough For It To Be A Real Problem And Just Used 3G Instead. This Was The Case For Both My Iphone And Ipad. Also  It Would Be Nice If There Was A Conditioner As Well As Shampoo And Body Wash. Finally  My Room Was Boiling Hot When I Arrived And Didn't Get Cooled Down Until I Let Reception Know About The Problem The Next Day. It May Be A Good Idea To Check That The Bedrooms Are At Room Temperature Before A Guest Arrives. This Didn't Ruin My Stay At All Though  It Was Fixed Very Quickly.,,,,,
,10,The Air Conditioner Is Very Noisy. The Internet Didn't Seem To Work With My Iphone 4S.,,,,,
,13,The Heater Was Rather Noisy.,,,,,
,14,Internet Connection Needs Further Consideration. Not Reliable To Update The Connection Every 24 Hrs.,,,,,
,18,The Heating System Was Strange,,,,,
,19,Yes  Please Do Something With The Internet Connection.  Is Awful. (Speed And Methodology).,,,,,
,21,Desk Is Small,,,,,
,25,Foam Pillows Are Not Comfortable At All:),,,,,
,26,Very Spacious Room. Found The Counter Space In The Bathroom To Be Limited And Awkward To Get Into The Shower And Wait For The Water Temperature. I Came To Learn There Won't Be Electrical Outlets In The Bathroom In The Uk. Wish The Towel Warmer Was In A Different Location As My Leg Would Continuously Brush Up Against It. Air System Was A Bit Noisy But Did The Job. Enjoyed The Comlimentary Fruit Basket.,,,,,
,27,The Internet Was Very Slow The Toilet Seat Was So Near To The Heater Pipe The Key Chain Was Heavy,,,,,
,28,Tea And Coffee Tray As Standard Would Be A Bonus Although This Was Provided As Requested.,,,,,
,31,The Bathroom Is A Bit Dated - The Shower Wasn't Strong Enough And Is A Bit Cramped.,,,,,
,33,Comfortable  But I Don't Like Mirror Directly Facing To Bed As It Means Unlucky Or Bad Things In Asia. I Like Light Green Colour Appealing  And Bright Atmosphere Makes Me Feel Warm. The Thing Is That It Is Not Convient To Work In Rooms.,,,,,
,34,Not About The Bedroom But The Wifi Was Very Slow And Inconsistent And Kept Dropping Out  It Made Working On Emails Etc Quite Frustrating Especially When Trying To Download Documents.,,,,,
,37,Unfortunately There Was Little To No Internet Connection  Which Was A Big Problem,,,,,
,40,See Previous Comment,,,,,
,43,To Have A Channel Speaking French On The Tv  After Shopping We Would Liked To Watch Tv But For Us It Was Complicated Because It Was Only On English,,,,,
,52,When I Initially Checked In There Was Some Construction Noise In The Room Which I Understand Was Due To Your Ongoing Refurbishment.,,,,,
,54,I Would Appreciate A Firm Pillow But It's Ok.,,,,,
,56,In The Bath The Water Was Not Draining  I Was Suggested To Have Engineer In The Morning Or To Have The Shower In The Other Room On The Other Floor!!!!,,,,,
,58,A Desk Would Have Been Helpful For Work  Also Tea And Coffee Making Facilities,,,,,
,59,Very Comfortable More Than Adequate Size.  Heating Did Not Work Though.,,,,,
,60,None,,,,,
,61,The Internet Was Far Too Slow For Me And It Disconnected Everytime The 'Allowed Data Amount'-Or Whatever Was Full. I Download A Lot Of Analysis And Research And The Attachments Are Big. Also Using Bloomberg Was Almost Impossible. I Think Thie Internet Connection Is Probably The Only Thing I Found Not Top Of The Line At Your Hotel.,,,,,
,64,Too Smal,,,,,
,65,Extremely Comfortable Beds And Room And Very Quiet Indeed - Especially Given It Is Central London - A Real Treat To Have A Full Night's Sleep Without Background Noise.,,,,,
,66,No Complimentary Water. No Dressing Table. No Armchair.,,,,,
,69,The Internet Access Is Very Bad,,,,,
,70,No,,,,,
,71,Internet Was Increadibly Slow - I Was Unable To Work  Very Loud Noices From Room Next Door  Due To The Separator Door ,,,,,
,72,Slightly Tired Room.,,,,,
,75,There Was A Significant Of Disturbance When Other Rooms Open And Close Their Doors. Doors Do Hit Strongly And Make A Bad Noise.,,,,,
,78,I Stayed At 247 And Thought It Was A Bit Too Small. The Space For Working (Table) Was Definitely Too Small,,,,,
,79,So Nice & Quiet,,,,,
,80,The Decor Is Very Quintessentially English And Understated. The Rooms Are Immaculately Clean By The Way - Cleanest Hotel I've Ever Stayed In. The Bathroom Products Were Ok  They Didn't Really Strike Me As 5 Star.,,,,,
,82,Unfortunately Before Going To Bed I Closed The Light Switch That Was Part Of The Bedside Cabinet. This Caused It To Blow A Fuse For The Whole Room. It Was Dealt With Very Promptly By The Duty Staff When I Phoned Them  But I Wonder If It Needs Testing  Or Replacing.,,,,,
,83,The Wi-Fi Wasn't Working Propertly In Our Room Our Entire Stay. My Husband Called Down To The Front Desk About This And Was Told The Wi-Fi Was Working Fine. However  It Wasn't For Either Of Us. We Tried On Different Devices And Had The Same Issues With All Of Them. The Wi-Fi Signal Was Present But There Wasn't A Connection. When We Did Get A Connection It Was Dropped Very Frequently. My Husband Needed To Do A Bit Of Work During Our Stay And Unfortunately It Proved To Be Very Difficult Due To The Wi-Fi Issue. I'm Not Sure If It Was Specific To Our Room Location Possibly? I'd Suggest Looking Into This Though Particularly With Guests Who Stay In The Same Room Or Area Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,88,We Had An Issue About The Internet The Connection Was Weak,,,,,
,90,Tempature Was Approx. 29 Degrees Outside And So Was The Room.  The Airconditioning Was On  But Did Not Cool The Room.  I Slept Very Poorly And Was Very Disappointed With The Room.,,,,,
,91,Internet Wifi Was Really Unstable,,,,,
,95,The Bathroom Was Very Small Without Much Room For Storage Of Toiletries. Also  I Am Not Found Of The Separate Faucets For Cold & Hot Water.,,,,,
,97,I Miss Items To Make Coffee Or Tea.,,,,,
,106,I Did Not Like The Noise Coming From The Garbage Handler's Each Morning From 5:30Am-10Am. This Greatly Disturbed My Ability To Get Proper Rest Before My Work Meetings.,,,,,
,108,Spacious  But Old Fashioned And A Bit Simple In Design.,,,,,
,110,Not Enough Electrical Sockets. Tv Rather Unattractively Placed.,,,,,
,111,The Internet Connection In The Hotel Is Very Poor  And I Regret This  Because The Rest Of The Facilities Is Comfortable And Nice,,,,,
,112,Very Disappointed With The Room. The Walls Were Badly Stained As The Result Of A Leak. The Carpet Was Old. The Shower Head Not Very Strong. The Room Overall Was Very Dark And Depressing. Room 242,,,,,
,114,Having Tempurpedic Pillows Available,,,,,
,117,Poor Pressure On Shower,,,,,
,118,The Keihls Products Are Great,,,,,
,120,Internet Service At The Hotel Is Horrible And In Need Of Upgrade Immediately.,,,,,
,122,This Room Was One Of A Few That I Have Stayed In Recently And Felt That The Bedding Was Not As Comfortable As Previous Says - Particularly The Pillows,,,,,
,125,The Internet Was A Bit Slow So We Asked For The Business One And They Gave It To Us For Free Which Was Much More Efficient For My Daughter And I.  The Room...The First Room In The Capital Had A Very Noisy Air Conditioning Unit.  I Used To Work In This Area  So I Knew There Was Something Wrong With It. Luckily At Around 1 In The Morning They Changed Us As We Could Not Cope With The Humming Noise. We Tried Too But It Was Difficult And Then We Were Given A Much Brighter And Happier Room Too At The Front Of Basil Streeet Instead Of The Back Which Was So Nice.  I Am Not Sure What Happened Here With This Problem.  The Same Thing Happened In The Levin.  We Got Sent To The Top Again To The Back Of The Hotel And The Room Was Very Hard And Decorated For A Different Sort Of Couple.  So We Asked If We Could Change And We Got A Much Nicer Room.  It Was Lovely Bright And More Feminine I Guess But It Felt Nicer. The First One Seemed Very Masculine.  But We Were Happy In The Rooms We Stayed In.  The Bathrooms Were Lovely And Worked Well.,,,,,
,126,When In England Why Are The Toiletries Imported?,,,,,
,127,The Wifi System Is The Worst And Very Inconvenient To Use. Don't Understand Why The Log In Is So Complicated. The Room Is Too Small Particularly The Bathroom. I Was Actually Quite Disappointed By The Interior Design And Quality Of The Furnishing.,,,,,
,128,Thank You For The Upgrade The Room Was Excellent,,,,,
,129,Had To Ask For Internet Pass Word  And Not Very Iphone / Ipad Friendly. Slow Internet At All Hours Of Day.,,,,,
,134,Nice And Peaceful,,,,,
,135,Internet Access Was Extremely Slow  Running At About 16Kb/Sec. This Was Acceptable When Sending Or Receiving Small Emails With Just Text  But Nothing Else. Food Served As 'Room Service' Was Very Acceptable.,,,,,
,137,Small,,,,,
,139,No Outlet Available For Charging My Phone!! Had To Take Out The Tv  I.E. Could Not Watch... No Desk And Also No Outlet For Laptop  I.E. No Working. ,,,,,
,140,One Minor Complaint About The Wireless Internet Access Is That I Keep Having To Re-Authenticate To The Network (Several Times From Every Device  Within Each 24-Hour Period).,,,,,
,145,The Internet Connection Was Slow During Some Days Of The Stay. Possibly  A Writing Desk Would Also Be Beneficial.,,,,,
,146,Provision Of Tempurpedic Pillows On Request Would Be Competitive With Major Hotel Offerings,,,,,
,147,Not Sure Why You Required Different Complicated Log In Names And Passwords.  Most Hotels Provide One Password For The Stay.,,,,,
,149,The 'Up' Arrow On Heater Did Not Work  So In The Middle Of Night I Could Not Get Warmer  Only Cooler. It Turned Out The Down Arrow Could Control It If You Pressed Past Zero But This Was Not Intuitive. Room Seemed Quiet  Comfy Beds And Bedding...Nice Large Tub...Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,150,If I Remember Correctly  Hair Conditioner Is Not Provided (I May Be Mistaken) And If So  That Should Be Done. The Room Was Very Nice But On The Small Side.,,,,,
,152,Bathroom Did Not Seem Totally Fresh.   The Point Was Mentioned On My Way Out To The Theatre - On My Return  It Seemed Less Smelly But Still Not Quite Right...,,,,,
,155,The Only Issue I Had Was That The Controls For The Heating In Both Rooms Booked Were Difficult To Manage.,,,,,
,157,I Goind My Room Very Noisy Because Of Fans Or Equipment That Gave Of A Constant Noise All Night,,,,,
,159,I Think Kettles Should Be Provided In All Rooms,,,,,
,161,Light Infiltrated From The Hallway  Causing Difficulty In Sleeping,,,,,
,162,Bath A Little Small,,,,,
,165,Internet Rather Slow. No Desk Nor  Probably  Enough Room For A Desk So Working Would Not Be Particularly Easy.,,,,,
,167,I Don't Like The Configuration Of The 'Desk' Area Between The Wardrobes- It's Claustrophobic. Decor Of The New Queen Rooms Is A Delight  And The New Samsung Tvs Work Well.  Aircon Still Very Noisy.,,,,,
,168,Bathroom Too Small  Old Fashioned. Did Not Like The Old Style Taps Of Separate Cold And Hot Water Taps As Well As The Idea Of A Bath Tab. A Shower With Glas Doors Would Be More Convinient And More Hygienic Instrad Of The Plastic Curtains. Also The Lighting Was Very Poor And No Space In Bathroom Fr Toiletries.,,,,,
,169,Products In The Bathroom Did Not Appeal To Me. In My View They Are Provided Only For A Very Small Group Of People With Extreme Taste. I Am Not Sure Which Man Really Likes Peach Hair Wash?? The Room Was Very Small And Does Not Allow To Work. Internet Was Not Accessable Without Paying. The Majority Of Other Hotels  Which Cost Less That The Capital  Do Provide Internet Access For Free. I Consider This A Major Lack In Service. If You Save The Questionable Doorkeeper You Can Easily Offer Internet For Free. This Would Be Service I Would Appreciate.,,,,,
,170,My Room Was Spotless,,,,,
,175,At The Frigobar  All Best Hotels Have Sanpelegrino Water Or Perrier.,,,,,
,176,It Needs Renovating,,,,,
,177,Internet Very Very Slow,,,,,
,179,Te Arms On The Lamps Are Loose  The Pelmet Is Coming Off  A Lack Of Detail,,,,,
,181,Size Was Good  Dressing Room Great  Bathroom Great. - Chairs Were Uncomfortable And I Had To Ask For A Chair To Be Brought In That I Could Be Comfortable In - Desk Surface Was Not Practical - Internet Arrangments Seem 20 Years Old --- It Seems Small But Its A Real Disadvantage From My Perspective When I Have To Keep In Touch With The Office.  I Havent Been In A Hotel In About 5 Years That Had Such A Complicated Set-Up For Internet Access. It Detracted From All The Great Things About The Hotel  Which Seems Silly  But Internet Access Has Become Table-Stakes.,,,,,
,182,For Some Reason  I Was Able To Access The Internet On My Ipad But My Wife Was Not.,,,,,
,187,In Previous Comment Section Above. Starched Sheets And Bed Making A-Plus,,,,,
,188,The Desk Was Far Too Small To Be Able To Use My Laptop  So I Had To Sit On One Of The Armchairs With My Computer On My Lap.  Also  I Could Only Find One Useable Power Point In A Really Inconvenient Location!,,,,,
,189,I Stayed In Room 249  That Has Been Recently Re-Decorated. The Room Is A Bit Too White  And Lacks Some Traditional Feel Of The Older Rooms. My Main Point Of Dislike Is That The Room Has A Minute Desk  Jammed Between Two Froor To Ceiling Cupboards  Making The Desk Unusable For Working With Any Comfort. I Did Not Like This Feature At All Of The Room  Although I Understand It Was Designed This Way To Fit The Upright Cupboards. I Would Rather Not Have The Sofa  But Use That Space Between The Wall And The Bed To Place A Desk And Nice Chair.,,,,,
,191,Little Bit Tired In Fittings  Decor & Bathroom Appliances,,,,,
,192,Bathroom Rather Compact And Traditional  No Space For Bits And Pieces,,,,,
,194,Unbelievably Slow Internet   Nothing High Speed About It. Tv Channels Were Limited At Best  Espn Was Even Scrambled.,,,,,
,198,Our Bathroom Is Need Of Refurbishment - Certainly Not Of A 5 Star Level But Rather A 3 Star.  Also I Believe The Smell Of The Bathroom Products Were Much More Appealing To Men.,,,,,
,199,The Glass Shelves In The Bathroom Were Lose So The Toiletries Provided Had Spilled Onto The Floor And The Toilet Flush Ran Continually.,,,,,
,200,Super !,,,,,
,201,Have Stayed On A Few Occasions Over The Last Year And Find Some Pillows Are Great - Others Aren't. Also Booked A Double Room And Do Not Like Twin Beds Pushed Together. Will Definitely Check This Before Next Booking. Also - Really Like The Room To Black Out - Whilst On Leisure I Like Not To Wake Up Too Early!,,,,,
,202,No  All Very Good,,,,,
,204,A Shame That I Found A Bit Of Broken Glass On The Bedroom Floor  By Stepping On It.  The Problem Was Resolved By E Staff Quickly Though.  Also I Missed The Larger Bathroom Of The Junoir Suite And The Products There.,,,,,
,208,It Was Very Quiet.,,,,,
,211,Found The Air Con Very Noisy And Evan When Turned Off There Was Still A Humming Noise,,,,,
,212,Wifi Connection Was Inconsistent; Sometimes Good Sometimes Bad.   Tv Signal Did Not Work.,,,,,
,213,On The Small Side,,,,,
,217,I Have Been Staying At The Capital For More Than 20 Years  On And Off. I Love The Hotel And Find The Friendly Staff Very Comforting. It Is Like A Home Away From Home For Me. The Rooms  In Some Cases  Need Or Are Getting Close To Needing A Bit Of Freshening Up. The Carpets Especially.,,,,,
,220,Neom Do A Lovely Range Of Organic Bath Products Which Have Not Been Seen In Hotels - To The Best Of My Knowledge. Would Be A Good Platform For Them Too.,,,,,
,221,Internet Was Very Slow And Struggled To Download Large Files,,,,,
,222,Hair Conditioner Needed.,,,,,
,225,The Wifi DidnâT Offer Constant Internet Access.,,,,,
,226,None,,,,,
,228,Very Noisy Air Conditioning Unit. It Thumped At Irregular Intervals Which Was Disturbing At Night Time.,,,,,
,229,On Future Trips I Will Ask For A Bedroom (Or A Suite) With A Desk At Which I Can Work.,,,,,
,233,The Old Wooden Key Was Not Easy To Use Plus I Had To Remember Taking It Down With Me Every Time I Left The Room,,,,,
,238,The Bathroom Products Had Changed - Preferred The Previous Products.,,,,,
,239,The Air Conditioning Unit Was Slightly Annoying !!,,,,,
,241,Room Really Small   Hard To Use The Desk To Work,,,,,
,242,Lovely Decoration With Very Personal Details (Ribbons Around Sanitary Paper Etc.)  Welcome Note Accompanied By Delicious Cookies!,,,,,
,243,Decor And Paintwork Around Doors Etc Needs Redoing,,,,,
,244,We Stayed In The Studio Apartment  Very Happy With The Size Of The Room  Bathroom  And Kitchen.  However  The Furniture Is A Little Dated And Sparse.  Otherwise Very  Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,245,All Splendid.,,,,,
,247,Had To Move Rooms As Shower Didn't Work . No Upgrade Offered .,,,,,
,251,This Room 231 Was Fine,,,,,
,253,I Know Room Service Is Available But Would Have Welcomed A Complimentary Tea And Coffee Sachet In The Kitchen To Enjoy At Our Own Leisure Whilst Unpacking.  Everything Was Kept Immaculate.,,,,,
,259,Bedroom Allocated Was Comfortable But  Small With Limited Wiggle Room,,,,,
,262,We Find The Decor Tired And Dated  However  Fine For Us As We Love The Overall Experience Of The Capital. We Wouldn't Recommend To Many Of Our Friends As They Prefer A Higher Level Of Design In Their Hotel Stays   The Ambience And Service Outway Our Need For Design.,,,,,
,264,The Desk Is A Bit Small And Lacks Proper Lighting For An Ageing Visitor......,,,,,
,265,Irritating And Embarrassing To Have To Ask For Conditioner Every Time I Wanted To Wash My Hair. Bring Back The Days Of An Excellent Selection Of Bulgari Or Molton Brown Products.,,,,,
,266,I Would Prefer A 2 Seater Sofa Rather Than 2 Arm Chairs,,,,,
,268,The Bed Is A Bit Too Soft And Needs A Bit More Support.  The Pillows Were Excellent.  Accessing The Internet Was Way Too Much Work.  The Problem Accessing The Internet Was On Multiple Fronts.  The Signal Stregnth In My Room Was Variable Which Accounted For Overall Speed  However The Glaring Issue Is The Connection Behind The Hotel's Router.  During My Stay The Dns (Domain Name Server) Was Unable To Resolve Addresses.  I Was Able To Overcome This By Manually Configuring My Devices To Point To My Dns In Ny Which Was Able To Resolve Internet Names.  I Did Notice That On My Last Evening At The Hotel Overall Service Was Greatly Improved At Times But Still Noticed Problems With The Dns Being A Bit Spotty.  Overall The Service Was Frustrating And I Am Sure To A Guest That Is Less Savvy Useless At Times.,,,,,
,269,I Was Missing Shaving Kit. Desk Was Not Very Sufficient To Work At.,,,,,
,270,Die Renovierten Zimmer Strahlen Wenig Wã¤Rme Und Individualitã¤T Aus. Esa Fehlt Das Brische!!!,,,,,
,271,The Only Criticism Is That There Was Some Kind Of Machinery Outside Our Window That Would Come On Very Early In The Morning And Was Very Loud.,,,,,
,273,The Bedroom On This Last Visit Could Do With Some Modernisation,,,,,
,275,Extremely Comfortable Bed And I Slept The Entire Night  Without Waking - Highly Unusual For Me Due To Stress Of Work!  The Ambiance Of The Hotel Obviously Relaxed Me Completely.,,,,,
,278,It Was Very Quiet Despite Being On The Street-- The Upholstered Walls And Thick Curtains Really Helped. One Of The Reasons I Decided To Stay At The Capital Was The Emphasis On Decor And Decoration Both In The Hotel's Website And In Comments-- Important To Us And We Were Not Disappointmed. View In Our Childrens Room (273) Was Not Good; But Not Really Material.,,,,,
,281,The Bathrooms Could Be Equipped With A Magnifying Face Mirror For Shaving/ Make Up,,,,,
,282,We Were Placed In A Room Across From Two Rooms Under Construction. The Noise Was Disruptive And The Construction Dust Has Left Us With Dirty Clothes And Lingering Lung Congestion. Paint Door Was Also A Problem. We Were Moved For Our Final Night To The Other End Of The Hall But The Construction Dust Was Still An Issue.,,,,,
,283,Tap Need To Change To The More Modern One  Can Be More Easy To Mix The Hot And Cold Water,,,,,
,285,We Had To Move Rooms Because Of Construction.  Thank You,,,,,
,286,For Us The Bathroom Was Too Small  And Should Choose A Different Room Next Time.  We Ideally Would Like A Walk In Shower And Opposed To One In The Bath.,,,,,
,288,Not So Sure About The New Decor! A Bit Bland Now When It Used To Be More 'Traditional English' And 'Cosy'!,,,,,
,290,I Feel That The Internet Should Be Free Of Charge For The Entire Stay In A Hotel Of This Standard,,,,,
,291,One Of The Rooms Had Water On The Floor In The Bathroom Which At First We Thought Was A Leak From The Bath.Although This Was Reported When We Went Out In The Evening And Was Acknowledged By Reception  Nobody Went To The Room. The Towels Were All Over The Floor When We Returned To The Room Around Midnight.The Room Was Not Even Picked Up With The Turndown Service. Somewhat Dissapointing But Not A Major Issue.,,,,,
,296,No Evening Turn Service And Lack Of Complimentary Evening Water Was Disappointing Given The Rates,,,,,
,298,Very Small Room. Cleaning And Housekeeping Services On The Weekend Were Lacking. Glasses Removed From Bathroom And Not Replaced. Had To Ask For Wash Clothes. Too Many Calls To Housekeeping. Monday Our Room Was Cleaned Wonderfully. Not The Same Care Is Taken On The Weekends. The Hotel Seems To Be Short Staffed.,,,,,
,299,Just A Little Small With Chair Squeezed Beside Bed,,,,,
,300,There Was A Slight Problem Because I Asked For A Twin Bedroom And It Was A King Size Bed That Was Not Yet Separated On Coming Into The Room. The Room Was Lovely And Thank You For The Upgrade But In Future If A Twin Bed Room Is Requested It Is Nice To Have It Already Separated Before Entering The Room I Think.,,,,,
,302,Internet Was Not Simple To Set Up - Complicated & Slow ( I Was Using An Ipad ) . Slow Speed,,,,,
,303,My Only Criticisms Of Our Stay Relate To This Section And Are:- 1. The Room Was Not Serviced Whilst We Were Out During Saturday Morning Which We Found Odd 2. The Wi-Fi Was Very Slow  Please Note That These Are Minor Criticisms And Do Not Detract From The Enjoyment Of Our Stay,,,,,
,306,There Was No Table For The Trays From Room Service !!!,,,,,
,310,Comfortable Bedroom But No Table To Work At.,,,,,
,316,Only That You Should Keep The Large Dresser / Bureau With Drawers In The Room For Future Guests ....,,,,,
,319,Very Comfortable,,,,,
,322,Some Of The Furnishings Are Looking Like They Are A Bit Worn,,,,,
,324,I Mentioned Something About 'Itching' Experience Throughout My Stay.Even My Children Have Experienced It.,,,,,
,328,Yes  It Was Facing The Fire Department And On The 2Nd Floor So Had To Have The Heavy Curtain Drawn All The Time And It Was Quite Noisy Outside.  I Know Not Much Can Be Done About The Location But Maybe Sound-Proof Glazed Windows? Difficult To Access The Internet As Had Iphone With Me And Not Laptop.,,,,,
,329,The Only Negative Comments At All Concerning The Hotel Are With The Size Of The Bathroom  Which We Found Very Small.  There Was Inadequate Space In The Washroom For The Storage Of Toiletries.  The Fact That The Hot And Cold Faucets Are Separate Was Also Inconvenient.,,,,,
,330,As Other Hotels We Advice You To Offer Internet Free Of Charge,,,,,
,332,No Shaving Mirrors,,,,,
,333,I Do Not Really Work In The Room And I Do Not Use The Internet. The Bedroom Certainly Serves My Purposes (And Those Of My Wife When She Comes Along),,,,,
,336,Although The Quality Of Products In The Bathroom Was Good  The Range Was Not Complete In Terms Of What One Might Normally Expect,,,,,
,337,The Internet Speed Is Low .,,,,,
,338,Magnifyiing Shaving Mirror/Make Up Mirror Required My Husband Cut Himself Shaving On Each Morning Of Our Stay,,,,,
,339,My Bedroom Was Not Alrge But It Was Clean  Smelled Wonderfully Clean  And Was Not At All 'Corner-Cutting' ; The Little Bag Of Homemade Biscuits Was Touching .,,,,,
,340,Radiator In Ensuite Was Very Hot And Far To Close To The Toilet With A Real Chance Of Burning Your Leg. Had To Ask Twice For Tea And Cups To Go With The Kettle In The Room,,,,,
,341,The Tv Could Be A Little Larger For Those Of Us With Aging Eyes.,,,,,
,342,This Was A Recently Refurbished Bedroom And The Nicest I Have Stayed In In This Hotel. It's Fresh  Spring- Like Decor Was The Perfect Complement To The Season.,,,,,
,346,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our (Short) Stay At The Capital But  As On Previous Visits  We Found The Bedroom More Functional Than Luxurious For The Money (Although We Do Acknowledge The High Room Rates Charged In London Generally Compared To Many Other Cities Around The World - Eg. We Recently Stayed At The Mandarin Oriental In Bangkok In A Butler Serviced And Extremely Comfortable Suite At A Lower Room Rate); In Addition  We Found The Air Conditioning Noisy To The Extent That We Had To Switch It Off Before Retiring To Bed And  During The Night  We Were Awakened By An Intermittent 'Banging' Noise Coming From Some Other Part Of The Building Which Could Have Been The Air Conditioning System  The Lift Mechanism Or A Door Closing And Opening At Regular Intervals?,,,,,
,351,Internet Should Be Easier  I.E. Only Tick In Name And Room Number,,,,,
,352,Although I Like Traditional Design  The Walling Was Very Dull Along Side The Red Crushed Velvet And Brown Furniture   Funny ' Mums And Dad' Wardrobe ! Wall Lights And Shades Need Upgrading......Glad I Wasn't Spending Too Much Time In The Room   Shower Curtain Very Dated Now Should Be Glass Screen,,,,,
,355,There Is No Clock In The Room.  I Think That You Should Have An Alarm Clock With Visible Numbers In The Dark.,,,,,
,361,There Was No Desk In The Bedroom  So It Was Uncomfortable To Work In The Room,,,,,
,362,Bedroom Was Lacked Warmth  Decor Was Uninviting  & Any Style,,,,,
,363,Air Conditioning Was Poor And Not Effective,,,,,
,364,Bathroom Is Very Small! Have You Tried To Sit On The Toilet Without Burning Your Thigh?,,,,,
,367,Bed Was Very Comfortable; Loved The Sheets.  Cookies That Were There When We Arrived Were Delicious (We Were Hoping For More The Next Day  But Alas ...).  Bathroom Was A Little Small  But Fine.   The Only Problem We Had Was The Internet.  I Was Unable To Connect To My Office With My Laptop Due To Weak Signal.   My Ipad Did Work  But That Does Not Provide The Full Range Of Service That I Wanted.,,,,,
,370,The Bed Was Slightly Small But I Am A Tall Man!,,,,,
,371,Internet Was Very Patchy. There Is No Dedicated Easy To Work At Desk.,,,,,
,372,The Fridge Generated A Lot Of Heat In Its Confined Space Which Concerned Me Somewhat And Meant The Glassware Was Always Very Warm To Use. Also On The Occasions I Had Room Service  There Was Really Nowhere To Put The Tray Except On The Bed.,,,,,
,373,Tea/Coffee Making Facilities Would Have Been Appreciated,,,,,
,377,The Bed And Furnishings Were Excellent....The Pillows Were Wonderfully Comfortable. Unfortunately The Strength Of The Wi-Fi Signal Was Variable Inconsistent And Never Really Strong Enough For Business Or Personal Use.,,,,,
,380,Internet Far To Slow,,,,,
,382,As Previously Mentioned  I Simply Got A Bad Room.,,,,,
,383,Like Many Hotels  No Conditioner - Only Shampoo.  Bottle Of Hand Lotion Had Already Been Used (Not Great!) Ac Unit Very Noisy - Had To Switch Off On Second Day And Open Windows.  Overall Too Hot For Us.,,,,,
,388,Very Comfortable And Spacious. We Were Very Happy.,,,,,
,389,Not Really A Desk To Work At  But I Agree That A Hotel Is Not An Office :-),,,,,
,390,Traveling With My Elderly Mother Was Made Extremely Pleasant During Our Stay. Your Staff Even Provided A Tea Tray And Kettle For Her Nocturnal Cuppas.,,,,,
,391,Light Fixtures Were Loose On Wall. Waste Paper Basket Didn't Fit Decor.,,,,,
,392,I Stayed In 276 And For That Price I Expected More.,,,,,
,394,The Room Did Not Really Resemble The Deluxe Room Shown On The Website.  I Had Asked For A Quiet Room  So Maybe This Was Why It Was A Room At The Back And Not One Of The High Ceiling Rooms With Large Sash Windows.  However  It Wasn't Particularly Quiet As There Are A Lot Of Large Air-Con Units Blasting Away From The Buildings Opposite.  The Room Was Rather Dark And A Bit Drab  Again Very Different From The Website Pictures Where The Decor Is Very Bright And The Fabrics Colourful.  There Was Only One Comfy Chair  And No Proper Desk Or Dressing Table.  The Bathroom Was Rather Tired.  The Fruit Was A Very Nice Touch  However The Small Bottles Of Mineral Water Were A Bit Mean.  The Evening Turn-Down Service Was Offered At About 6.30 - A Time When Most People Are In Their Rooms Getting Ready For The Evening.,,,,,
,395,Didn't Like The Room As It Was Not One Of The Newer Renovated Rooms. The Air Conditioning Went On And Off With Big Bang. Certainly Wouldn't Stay In The Older Room Again.,,,,,
,396,The Air Conditioning Unit Made A Lot Of Noise.,,,,,
,397,We Were Upgraded To A Very Nice Large Quiet Room,,,,,
,399,There Is Quite A Bit Of Noise From The Outside  Back Of The Hotel And Also Slamming Of Doors Early Mornings.,,,,,
,400,The Internet Signal Is Sadly Lacking In Rooms I Stay In On Testing Reception Area Is Workable. I Have Commented On This Every Time I Stay  This Makes It Very Difficult For Me To Conduct My Business.,,,,,
,401,It Was Just Right - Not Too Big.  It Was Cozy And Warm And Tasteful.  And It Wasn't Too Designer And Modern.,,,,,
,405,The Level Of Lighting In My Room Was Wholly Inadequate For Hair/Makeup/Reading Or Work,,,,,
,407,Air Conditioning In Some Rooms Better Than Others.,,,,,
,409,Tne Wireless Signal Was Weak And The Daily Log On Procedure With Changing Codes Etc Was A Chore -- Way Too Cumbersome Compared To Other To Hotels.  This Was The Only Thing About The Capital That I Thought Was Second Rate  But It Is Very Important To Us When We Travel To Have Constant  Reliable Wireless Access To The Internet.,,,,,
,410,We Were Upgraded To A Junior Suite  Very Very Nice.,,,,,
,413,The Lighting Could Be Improved Considerably. Lighting Around The Desk Area As Well As Lighting Of The Bed Lamps For Reading In Bed.,,,,,
,420,I Think Most People Prefer A Single Faucet Simply For Ease Of Use,,,,,
,424,Just The Sawing And Banging And Whirring Of Machines.,,,,,
,433,One Word-Perfect!,,,,,
,434,I Usually Stay In A Single Room.  The Redesign Of These Rooms I Find Unattractive - The Decor Is Cold  Bleak And Clinical (Like A Hospital Room!)  The Old Rooms With A Smaller Bed Were Much More Attractive (To Me)  And More Comfortable.  If You Have One Single That You Have Not Remodelled Let Me Have The Number And I Will Reserve That Next Time!  But I Suppose You Have More Double Rooms To Sell?,,,,,
,435,Need Modernisation,,,,,
,436,So Many Bathrooms Have A 'Volume' Control  Apparently For Tv Sound. This Is A Nice Amenity. Howeer Like So Many Of This Ilk It Didn't Work. Also A Shaving/Makeup Mirror Is Increasingly Expected In An Upscale Bathroom. This Was Lacking.,,,,,
,437,I Appreciated The Lovely Biscuits On Arrival,,,,,
,441,The Lock Broke On The Toilet And My Wife Was Locked In. Not Great!,,,,,
,444,Very Comfortable Bed,,,,,
,445,Found Lighting Too Dull Especially In The Dressing Room Area. Difficult To See To Put Make Up On And Would Love A Magnification Mirror Also For Make Up,,,,,
,446,I Found The Heating System Too Noisy To Leave On And A Simple Radiator Would Take Up Less Room And Be More Efficient,,,,,
,448,Surprise At The Cost Of Half Bottle Of Champagne Also No Champagne Fluts In The Room And It Took 30 Mins At Least For Them To Arrive,,,,,
,452,Perhaps The 'Classic Double' Is A Bit On The 'Compact' Size  And When I Visit The Capital Next Time We Will Most Probably Upgrade To A Larger Room. But Its The Excellent Service  And The Convenient Location  That Makes The Capital Stand Out From The Pack.,,,,,
,455,The Tv Choices Were Very Limited,,,,,
,458,Usual Trip Is For A Few Hours Sleep Only  So I Book A Small Room. When My Wife Is Along  I Book Something Better  Which Is Always Enjoyable.,,,,,
,460,No Clock Or I-Pod Holder And Bed Exceedingly Hard......I Did Ask Before Arrival As Well As On Arrival For Very Soft Mattress.,,,,,
,461,Appreciated The Number Of Plugs Available.  Bed And Linen Were Excellent.,,,,,
,462,Air Conditioning Was Ineffective At Night. As A Result The Room Was Very Hot At Night,,,,,
,468,Bathroom Much Too Small! Could Hardly Move In It.,,,,,
,472,Rather Small For Two Women To Share.,,,,,
,475,Air Con Very Noisy But Couldn't Open Window For External Noise,,,,,
,479,Internet Connection Glacial At Times  Sheets Duvet Etc Excellent But A Bath Towel That Wouldnt Dry One  Probably Needs Several Good Hot Washes To Create The Absorbency Neede For A Good  Towel  On The Other Hand The Hand Towel Was Excellent.,,,,,
,490,The Room Was A Little Small. There Was Not Enough Room For Two Suitcase Racks For Example.,,,,,
,492,I Preferred The Decoration Before You Redecorated The Rooms; Very Traditional 'English' And Comfortable.  This Stay My Room (225) Was Rather Plain.,,,,,
,495,Unfortunately The Bed Was Very Uncomfortable  Something I Had Not Experienced During Previous Visits .,,,,,
,498,The Bed And Linens Were Extremely Comfortable.  We Were With A Child And Had Difficulty With The Size.,,,,,
,499,The Care You Took To Tie Ribbons Around The Bathmat  Slippers  Etc. Was Delightful.  Your Provision Of Cookies Or Scones In The Afternoon Wrapped In White Linen Cloths Was A Special Treat.,,,,,
,506,No.,,,,,
,507,The Bath Design Isn't Optimal ..No Walk In Shower And Te Towel Racks Could Burn Your Leg While Sitting On Commode .,,,,,
,508,Loved The New Policy Of Free Internet.,,,,,
,510,I Think It's Time The Decor Was Changed  The Dressing Tables Have Been There For As Long As I Can Remember! The Blind Was Also Lopsided And It Took Me Ages To Wind It Down.,,,,,
,512,The Bathroom Could Have More Shelfs For The Toilet Cases,,,,,
,513,The Air Conditioning System Was A Bit Noisy,,,,,
,514,The Towel Rail Was Far Too Hot And Almost Touching The Toilet  My Wife Burnt Her Knee  There Was No Control And It Was Not Possible To Regulate The Heat.,,,,,
,516,Room 272 Was The Best We Have Been In. This Is Our 3Rd Visit.,,,,,
,517,Beautifully Decorated In True English Style,,,,,
,519,Very Comfortable,,,,,
,521,The Room 272   Was Ok   But That Was It. No Lift  We Are Between 70 And 80   The Bed Was Hard And No Coffee Cooker. ,,,,,
,522,Bathroom Very Small Bath Hard To Get Out Off,,,,,
,523,We Did Not Stay,,,,,
,526,Extremely Comfortable And Clean,,,,,
,527,The Bed Was A Bit Lumpy,,,,,
,529,The Bedroom Carpet Was Stained And I Would Have Expected A More Up To Date Bathroom  The Toilet Was Scratched/Stained,,,,,
,533,Decor In The Bedroom Was Dull Ad Needed Updating,,,,,
,534,Wonderfully Large And Delightfully Traditional,,,,,
,535,Slightly Surprised To Find The The Coffee Cup Saucer Etc I Had On Arrival In The Room Was Still There When   Beds Were Turned Down. Not A Great Problem!,,,,,
,541,I Would Have Liked My Apartment (#501) To Have Had More Hotel Information - Eg Hotel Directory With Room Service Options And Details Re The Housekeeping Service To The Apartments.,,,,,
,542,Only That Rather To My Surprise The Coffee Cups Etc Were Still In The Bedroom At The Time Of Turning Down The Beds. We Had The Coffee At 11-30Am. This Is Not A Serious Complaint But Worth Mentioning.,,,,,
,544,Stayed In A Flat. The Flat Was Stark. Bathroom Small.,,,,,
,546,I Hope Tea&Coffee Service.,,,,,
,581,Choice Of Pillows?  My Preference  Together With My Son Conor Is A Firm Pillow.    Joan.,,,,,
,588,Bathrooms Need Attention,,,,,
,597,Happy To See You Have Remodeled/Updated.,,,,,
,611,It Served My Purpose,,,,,
,613,No Dressing Table  Bathroom Very Small And Very Little Shelf Space,,,,,
,614,The Safe Had A Faulty Control Panel  So We Had To Change Rooms.,,,,,
,623,Maybe You Could Have More Adaptors As I Did Not Bring Mine And Could Not Have One Until The Last Day Of My Stay So I Could Not Change My Phone /I Pad,,,,,
,644,The Internet Connection Was Very Slow And Spotty. The Bathroom Door Was Coming Off Its Hinges And Didn't Close Properly.,,,,,
,650,It Was One Of The Smallest Rooms I Have Stayed In At The Capital Or In London.,,,,,
,651,Loved It Very English,,,,,
,653,Room Desperately Needs Carpet Replaced.,,,,,
,654,Although I Like Traditional Interiors  I Found The Walling To Be Dull And Lifeless Along With The Crushed Velvet And Mixture Of Brown Furniture.... Wouldn't Like To Have Spent Too Much Time In The Room,,,,,
,660,First Room Was Too Small  So We Were Moved To Another.,,,,,
,661,Air Con Was Very Noisy,,,,,
,662,Internet Speed Is Now Better.Wish It Was A Bit Faster,,,,,
,664,Yes I Think It Time That The Baths Were Removed And Replaced With Showers Only. Stepping In And Out Of The Shower Is Very Dangerous And Also Showering In The Bath Is Dangerous And Uncomfortable,,,,,
,667,Uninspiring Design - Very Plain And Rather Ordinary,,,,,
,668,Internet Seemed To Drop Out,,,,,
,672,Bathroom Shower Wld Benefit From A Curtain Rather Than The Cumbersome Glass Semi-Door. Latter Is Not Only Inconvenient But Also Somewhat Dangerous.,,,,,
,673,No Magnifying Mirror In Bathroom.  Plumbing Weak.,,,,,
,676,Wifi Cut In And Out,,,,,
,681,The Connection To The Wifi Was Very Easy  But It Has Not Always Provide A Internet,,,,,
,682,None,,,,,
,683,Already Discussed,,,,,
,689,Yes! Too Warm And Uncomfortable. Heating In Bathroom Unable To Turn Off. Air Conditioner Too Noisy. The Room Small. Needs Mirror To Dry Hair And Apply Make Outside Of Bathroom.,,,,,
,714,No,,,,,
,716,If You Are To Compete With International Hotels Bathrooms Would Have To Increase In Size,,,,,
,719,Horrid Internet,,,,,
,729,Preferred Original Choice Of Bulgari And Kiehl Toiletries :) Also Internet Can Be Slow At Times.,,,,,
,732,ÃMalo Overpriced  Did Not Match The Detscrtiptiont,,,,,
,733,Rm 241 Had Residual Smell Of Cigarette Smoke. Spoke To Reception. Housekeeping Sprayed Neutraliser.,,,,,
,765,Room 238 ......Very Dreary  Beige And More Beige...I Can't Remember The Room Number On Our Last Visit  But It Was Very Oppressive !! ..I'm Surprised The Capital Have Chosen To Go The Route Of " Dark" Or  "Bland" Which Is Acceptable In Some Of The Larger Chains.
The Capital Used To Be Very Stylish......... Quite Sad Really !  However The Bed Was Super Comfortable ,,,,,
,766,It's Too Small And There Is Barely Space For Moving Around.,,,,,
,768,New Single Room Layout Very Good
,,,,,
,775,Clean And Comfortable,,,,,
,776,Nice,,,,,
,788,Bathroom Was Cramped  Sink Very Small  No Shelf.,,,,,
,791,Shower A Bit Weak,,,,,
,794,Would Like A Card In The Room  Explaining A Tea Tray Can Be Brought Up To The Room If Required,,,,,
,795,We Were Kindly Upgraded  However The Room Above ( I Think May Be For Staff?) Was Quite Noisy And Disturbed My Sleep Around 6.15Am On Saturday And To And Froing Continued Until After 7Am. Fortunately This Was Not Repeated On Sunday,,,,,
,807,The Room Is Starting To Feel A Little Dated In Comparison To The Competition.  That Is Not To Say That There Is Anything Wrong With A Classic Style.  Some Of The Technology Seemed To Be Falling Behind.,,,,,
,808,Just The Right Size.,,,,,
,812,У Меня Был Самый Простенький Номер,,,,,
,813,Very Comfortable. Room 252 Was Decorated Prettily,,,,,
,814,No,,,,,
,818,We Were Upgraded So We Were Absolutely Delighted.,,,,,
,820,It Was Charming But We Could Hear All The Conversation In The Room Next To Ours
 Because Of An Internal Door Between The Two Rooms. This Did Not Prove To Be A Problem For Us As The Occupants Were A Family.,,,,,
,821,A Little Too Compact. There Was Not Enough Room In The Bathroom For My Cosmetics.,,,,,
,827,The Mattress And Bed Linens Were Very Comfortable. Capet Was Soiled And Needs To Be Cleaned And/Or Replaced. Television Is Dated And Needs To Be Enlarged To Contemporary Standards (42").  Satellite Tv Would Be Greatly Appreciated. Draperies Were Difficult To Operate - The Shear Drapes Could Not Be Raised Or Parted  Or We Weren't Instructed How To Do So By Staff. Please Stock The Bathroom With Extra Bath Towels,,,,,
,830,The Rooms We Had Were Small And Dated. I Was A Little Disappointed To Be Honest.,,,,,
,832,The Bed Appeared Larger In The Photo; While I Prefer A King Size Bed  I Neglected To Confirm The Size In Our Deluxe Room When Booking.  Having The Bed Size Noted In The Room Description Would Have Eliminated The "Surprise" Factor. That Said  I Slept Well  Irrespective Of Bed Size!,,,,,
,834,See Above,,,,,
,839,I Always Have An Issue Regarding The Lighting In The Bathroom. A Magnifying Mirror Would Make A Great Deal Of Difference,,,,,
,840,Small And Out Dated When Compared Others Of A Similar Cost,,,,,
,842,I Was Dissapointed Because The Air Con Unit On The Roof Was Directly Over Our Room. It Kept Me Awake All Night With Constant Rumbling Noise. ,,,,,

,2,The Afternoon Tea Is Very Good.,,,,,
,5,No. A Bigger Table Would Be Nicer.,,,,,
,12,The Waiting Staff Were The Best I Have Come Across In A Long Time.  Taking The Confidence To Help Me Choose A Dish And Also Approaching Us At The Right Time To See When Or If We Needed Anything Else.  Excellent.,,,,,
,14,Room Service Should Have More Choices . And The Services Should Be 24 Hrs Instead Closing At 11P.M.,,,,,
,26,Lovely  Friendly Staff. Helpful With My Menu Questions.,,,,,
,28,Restaurant Was Very Warm. However  I Accept That We Were There During A Mini Heat Wave,,,,,
,31,The Cooked Breakfast Options Could Be A Bit Broader To Include Things Like Egg Benedict Or Hot Cake.,,,,,
,33,When Having Breakfast  Sometimes It Is Like A Family Restaurant Not Very Quality.,,,,,
,37,There Was No Option To Have Food That Wasn't On The Set Menu  E.G. I Wanted An Omelet And A Cup Of Tea And Paid The Same Price As Someone Having A Buffet Breakfast. It Would Be Great If You Had More Organic And Free Range Options  E.G. Eggs,,,,,
,56,The Breakfast Waiter Was Not Fluent In English  Forgot What We Ordered  Was Not Professional Enought,,,,,
,59,Have Eaten At Restaurant Previously On A Couple Of Occasions It Was Nice To Be Remembered By Staff.,,,,,
,60,None,,,,,
,62,The Service Was Quite Slow - It Took Over Half An Hour To Prepare Our Room After The Meeting & Then The Courses Took Some Time To Arrive.  The Ham Hock Terrine Was Not Very Good.  The Fish Was Good But Not Excellent.  The Choclate Mousse & Ice Cream & The Petit Fours Were Excellent.,,,,,
,66,Nothing Outstanding But Far Happier Compared To The Service Of Accommodation Side,,,,,
,80,The Best Part Of The Stay. Felix And I Are Real Foodies  So We Had The Whiskey And Cheese Tasting (The Only One Offered In London So Keep It Up)  The Tasting Menu With Wine Flight In Outlaws And Afternoon Tea. Every Meal Was Exceptional And The Staff Extremely Enthusiastic Without Being Obsequious Or Patronising. You Took Us On A Gourmet Journey And We'll Be Back For More!,,,,,
,82,We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome  And Everything That Passed Our Lips Was Excellent. It Was A Comfortable Space In The Snug Bar  And The Dining Room Was Beautifully Decorated And Adorned  Well Spaced And Lit. The Service Was Impecable.,,,,,
,83,We Just Ate Breakfast At The Hotel. I'm Not Sure If That Was In The Metro Or Not But I Checked It Above. The Breakfast Was Very Good And I Felt There Was A Nice Selection. The Service Was Excellent.,,,,,
,85,Hope To See You Soon.,,,,,
,95,I Would Definitely Return To The Restaurant. The Food And Deserts Were Excellent!,,,,,
,96,I Did Not Think The Bar Food Was Anywhere Near Its Usual Standard.,,,,,
,97,The Bar Staff Were Really Friendly And Helpful?,,,,,
,100,The Breakfast Was Poor  No Variety Of Fresh Fruit   The Orange Juices Was Not Just Squeezed  The Omelets Were To Oily And The Bacon Poor Quality Or Not Well Done. ,,,,,
,103,Very Good. Had Late Suppers With Children After Theatre/Concerts And Staff Were Fantastic,,,,,
,110,The Food And Drinks Are Truly Excellent. We Love The Atmosphere In The Bar.,,,,,
,117,Very Nice,,,,,
,118,Great Hotel,,,,,
,122,I Didn't Actually Dine Just Had Wine In The Wine Bar,,,,,
,125,Christmas Lunch Was Lovely..Very Large And Felt A Little Too Full.  I Had Two Glasses Of Wine Only And I Was Aware Of Everything And It Was A Lovely Experience And Met The People In The Dinning Room...Very Friendly And Beautifully Done.  The Food Was Wonderful But I Felt Too Much.  I Liked The Experience Of Little Dishes Coming Inbetween And You Did Create Something Exciting To Enjoy. The Experience Is Important And You Definitely Dealt With That. The Food Was Incredible. I Have Eaten A Lot Recently In Paris And I Love Food.  I Used To Cook In Lodges So I Can Say I Appreciate Good Taste And Flavours Etc...But It Was A Lot Of Food And I Could Hardly Move When I Finished!  But Both Of Us Had A Lovely Day Due To The Meal.  The Weather Was Awful So We Went To Bed And Watched A Movie Afterwards...Wonderful Christmas Day.  Thank You,,,,,
,126,Our Biggest Disappointment At The Capital Was The High Tea.  We Saw That You Had Been Rated Very Highly And We Saw Pictures Of Tea Served In Elegant Surroundings; However  We Were Placed In A Conference Room With Four Other Tables.  No Atmosphere  No Ambiance  No High Tea Experience.  Unfortunately  I Had Promised My Family That This Was Going To Be A Very Special Part Of Our Trip And We Had Postponed It Until Our Visit To The Capital.  After Two Weeks Of Travelling In England This Was Where We Were Made To Feel The Least Welcome.  Even When We Checked In For Our Tea Booking There Seemed To Be Exchanged Glances Among The Staff Before We Were Quickly Rushed Out Of The Main Areas And Up The Back Stairs.  We Are Not Sure What We Did To Deserve This Treatment.  We Were Four Adults  Hotel Guests  And Dressed Smart Casual (Skirt For Me  Sweaters And Dress Slacks For The Men.  No Jeans).  It Still Irks Me To See The Photos Of Hotel Areas On Your Website That We Were Never Invited To Visit.,,,,,
,128,We Eat At Some Of The Best Places In London  And We Can Now Say That Outlaws Is Now One Of The Our New Places We Love  In Fact The Food  Wine And Service Is Some Of The Best We Have Had  The Bar Staff Are Also Amazing And Always Make Our Cocktails Just The Way We Like Them  Nothing Is To Much Trouble. We Lobe The Bar And All The Staff.,,,,,
,129,As I Am In Training  I Am Not Drinking Alcohol  And I Felt That The Bar Staff Scoffed At My Request For A Glass Of Water. (My Companion Made Up For Me),,,,,
,137,Nothing To Eat Just Drinks With Family And Friends,,,,,
,150,I Just Had Lunch At The Bar (A Snack Really),,,,,
,156,First Class,,,,,
,157,Was Dissapointed By The Lanquage And Use Of Constant Mobile Use By Next Table Of Men,,,,,
,162,We Had The Taster Menu Which Was Superb And Complement S To Your Very Accomplished Chef,,,,,
,165,Breakfast I Thought Was Only Fair. I Didn't Find The Buffet Particularly Tempting. I Requested Creamy Scrambled Eggs And They Were Slightly Overdone In My Opinion. Toast Was Bog Standard Bread Instead Of A Really Good Sourdough Bread Being Available.,,,,,
,167,Very Few Non-Fish Options. Some Plainer Fish Options Would Be Good Please As Well. Valule For Money Pretty Indifferent.,,,,,
,168,Only Used Once Breakfast Room Service And Comments Above Refer To That Only. Did Not Have A Chance To Dine In Hotel. Maybe Nxt Time.,,,,,
,169,Unfortunately  The Hotel Did Not Offer A 'Regular' Restaurant. Looking At The Menue  There Is Not One Normal Meet Dish Offered At The Hotel's Restaurant. Therefore  I Had To Leave The Hotel For Dinner. This Was A Big Disappointment. My Impression Is  That The Hotel Offers A Very Fancy Restaurant  Which Is Good For A Fancy Restaurant Visit But Not For A 'Normal' Hotel Guest Wha Is Just Hungry For A Normal Dinner.   The Breakfast Options Very Extremely Limited And Very Expensive. Service Was Vey Freindly.,,,,,
,172,Just Had A Drink In The Bar,,,,,
,179,Only One Bar Staff  So Service Was Very Slow  Restaurant Service Was Good At Diner  Breakfast  Not So,,,,,
,180,Breakfast Portions Were On The Small Side For The Hot Course. You Need To Add Some More Meat To Outlaws And Perhaps A Daily Special Of Fish And Meat To Allow Residents To Keep Dining With You.,,,,,
,190,Bar Service On Wed 15Th May Inferior To Previous 3 Nights,,,,,
,198,The Tasting Menu Was Absolutely Lovely And We Chose A Wonderful Rose Riesling That Went Brilliantly With It,,,,,
,199,I Also Had Afternoon Tea And It Was Very Disappointing  Particularly The Bread Used In The Tea Sandwiches,,,,,
,200,We Drank At The Bar But Ate Out   Would Have Loved To Have Eaten At Outlaw's  But Adult Children Had Organised A Surprise Outing That Evening Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,202,No All Very Good,,,,,
,211,Waitress Service Was A Little Slow But Still Enjoyed The Breakfast,,,,,
,212,Whilst We Enjoyed The Dinner We Did Find The Food Slightly Too Rich.,,,,,
,218,Communication With Staff At Breakfast Sometimes Problem Due To Language Limitations Of The Staff,,,,,
,219,The Bar Manager Was Very Kind And Pleasant And Top Notch,,,,,
,220,Too Much Cream On The Tasting Menu. Would Have Preferred To See Some Lighter Dishes. Thought It Ruined The Bass! Loved The Mackerel Though.,,,,,
,227,The Austrian Girl Who Was Serving The Wine Was Very Knowledgeable And A Pleasure To Have Serve Us,,,,,
,230,Breakfast Was Disappointing As There Was Insufficient Staff For The No Of Guests Who Descended On The Restaurant.  Hence Staff On Duty Could Not Cope. I Found No Milk Or Plates By Cereal Area. At The Time We Left We Noticed This Had Not Been Replenished Despite Mentioning It.,,,,,
,232,Our Table Was Booked For 8:30 Pm And We Enjoyed Cocktails Prior To Dinner However We Did Not Reach Our Table Until Almost 9:30 Pm And The Service Was Extremely Slow. We Were Discussing Prior To Dinner How Much We Would Like To Sample The Cheese Course But Because The Service Was So Very Slow We Decided To Abandon As By This Time It Was Almost 11:15 Pm!,,,,,
,236,The Meal We Had At Outlaws Was A Great Success  Especially When Compared To Our Last Meal There Some Months Ago.,,,,,
,239,Just Excellent !!,,,,,
,240,Everything Was Absolutely Delicious And The Service Excellent.,,,,,
,243,Gone Down Considerably Since Last Stay But That Was 15 Years Ago,,,,,
,244,More Selections Would Be Nice.,,,,,
,245,None,,,,,
,253,Exceptional Staff.,,,,,
,255,Breakfast Not Good. No Ham Or Cheese,,,,,
,257,Excellent Wine Lists And Knowlegable Staff. (Both Food And Wine),,,,,
,262,Very Impressed By Service Level On Your Bar And Outlaws. I Had Dinner On My Own At Outlaws And The Food Was Sensational. One Of The Best Meals I've Had In London.,,,,,
,266,My Mother Had To Send Her Monkfish Back In The Evening As It Was Cold And Under Cooked.  The Chef Sent His Apologies And A Fresh Monkfish Was Cooked Which Was To Her Liking.,,,,,
,267,We Have Visited Nathan Outlaw's Restaurant In Rock Several Times And The Experience At The Restaurant This Time Was The Equal Of Those Visits,,,,,
,268,The Bar Staff Is Exceptional. It Would Be Nice To Have A Few Other Choices Of Bar Food Besides The Nut  Olive And Rice Crisps.,,,,,
,272,Yes  Several Years I Brought It To Your Father's Attention That You Had Stopped Playing Christmas Music In The Bar Area  You Still Don't. Keep In Mind That Most Of Your Residents Are There Christmas Shopping And All Of Your Afternoon Crowd Has Been Shopping.  When I Come Back Next December I Hope To Hear Seasonal Music. Your Regular Music Is Fine During My June Visit.,,,,,
,273,No - Always Excellent,,,,,
,277,Need To Get The Outlaws Cookbook,,,,,
,278,Metro Was Very Different Experience Than Rest Of Hotel-- While Food Was Good  Not As Good (Nor As Expensive) Outlaw. Enjoyed A Lunch At The Bar-- The Sandwiches Were Exactly As Expected. We Had A Drink Every Evening At The Bar-- The Ambience And Service Were Lovely.,,,,,
,283,Breakfast Should Have More Fruits,,,,,
,290,I Would Have Liked To Try Outlaw's But Wouldn't Feel Comfortable In This Restaurant When Travelling Alone. The Food At The Metro Was Ok But Its Not Really A Pleasant Place To Be.,,,,,
,298,Room Service Forgot Some Item Everyday Ie Butter  Salt  And Pepper  Sugar. A Larger Tray Or Trolley Would Allow For All Items To Fit On The Tray.,,,,,
,300,Didn't Really Think The Afternoon Tea Was Good Enough. The Sandwiches Were Slightly Dry And The Cakes Were Mediocre - I Think Serving An Eccles Cake For Afternoon Tea In A Luxury Hotel Is Cheap  As Eccles Cakes Are Very Ordinary - The Cakes Need To Be More Luxurious. The Scones Were Lovely.,,,,,
,302,The Service Was A Little Slow. If We Had Been Pressed For Time It Could Have Been Uncomfortable . Set Menu Very Good Value. House White Wine Was Very Pleasant. Wines Generaaly Appeared Very Expensive.,,,,,
,305,We've Always Enjoyed Dining At The Capital But Have To Say That We Find Mr Outlaw's Menu Boring. If I Want To Eat Ling  Plaice Or Gurnard I'll Go To The Fish & Chip Shop! Come On Mr Outlaw  Your Cooking Is Great So Put Some Lovely Dover Sole  Turbot & John Dory On Your Menu. Also  The Standard Of The Bar Menu Has Dropped Since Outlaw Took Over. We Enjoy The Metro Very Much.,,,,,
,306,No,,,,,
,314,I Had A Very Relaxing And Enjoyable Late Night Dinner At The Bar,,,,,
,316,Very Pleasant Service - Always With A Smile.,,,,,
,320,Friendly And Professional Staff. Again Bravo!,,,,,
,327,Nice To Be Offered (Without Having To Ask For) Gluten Free Bread When I Mentioned I Did Not Eat Regular Toast.,,,,,
,328,Dining Excellent.Breakfast (Continental) Could Be Improved (More Choices).,,,,,
,330,I Love The Bar....,,,,,
,333,Missing My Greek Yogurth !,,,,,
,336,We Did Not Dine; We Just Used The Bar Service.,,,,,
,338,Outlaws Seemed Unappetising And No Visible Diners On The 2 Nights We Were Present . Had The Menu Been More Varied   We Would Have Eaten In The Hotel   But Instead Went To A Local Italian Off Basil Street. Breakfast At The Hotel Was Excellent.,,,,,
,339,I Feel Ive Filled In This Survey Before ; But Suffice To Say The Bar Staff Were Wonderful   Courteous And Generous Although We Ordered Only Soft Drinks.,,,,,
,340,The Young Lady  Julia  Who Looked After Us Was Both Professional And Friendly And Made Our Experience That Bit More Special. Julia Even Arranged To Email A Copy Of The Tasting Menu That She Had Promissed To Let Us Have. That Extra Touch Really Counts.,,,,,
,342,Again  Friendly And Efficient Service.,,,,,
,345,At The Bar We Were Served Nuts With Olive Stones Obviously Left There By Previous Guests. Being Serverd Leftovers If Not What I Expect From A Hotel  Any One.,,,,,
,346,One Of The Best Dinners We Have Had For Some Time In Terms Of Food Quality  Cooking Skills And Balanced Service.,,,,,
,347,The Staff In The Bar Restaurant Are Excellent  Charming  Welcoming A Credit To The Hotel,,,,,
,350,Due To Our Tight Schedule  Our Only Regret Is That We Did Not Dine With You. We Look Forward To Our Next Stay With You  And Dining With You.,,,,,
,351,Nice And Very Friendly,,,,,
,352,We Were Greeted By A Very Surly Restaurant Manager  Quite Gruff Infact !!   The Atmosphere Was Not A Happy One  Quite A Shame Really .... I Didn't Enjoy That !  ,,,,,
,355,Breakfast Should Be Included In The Room Rate,,,,,
,361,Although I Did Not Dine At The Outlaw Restaurant This Time  But I Tried It Before And My Comments Above Relate To A Previous Period,,,,,
,363,Breakfast Only,,,,,
,364,The Quality Of The Breakfast Has Diminished Over The Year: Croissants Are Not Crisp  Lower Quality Of Bread  Quality Of Marmalades (Big Difference  Now Just Tastes Sweet  No Fruit) ..Cofee... Perhaps Take Breakfast On The Corner? ,,,,,
,367,The Egg Salad Sandwiches Were Excellent.   I Am Not Sure What The Name Is For The Area Next To The Bar Where We Had Breakfast  But The Food And Service There Were Very Nice.,,,,,
,369,Breakfast In Bedroom Was Pretty Ordinary.,,,,,
,372,The Seasonal Menu At Outlaws Was Spectacular.,,,,,
,373,Restaurant Manager Was Excellent As Was All The Service And Both The Food And Wine Were Excellent. Only Minor Disappointment Was That The Tasting Menu Was Not The Same As The One In The Room  And I Was Therefore Already Looking Forward To Dishes That Were No Longer On The Menu Which Led To A Little Sense Of Disappointment,,,,,
,379,Delicious Food,,,,,
,387,The Quality Of The Meal Was Excellent. However  Not Many Side Dishes Were Available. We Did Manage To Obtain Boiled Potatoes And Kale But The Quantities Were Not Quite Enough. We Had Been Running In A Charity Run In Hyde Park And Needed Larger Quantities.,,,,,
,388,We Didn't Actually Have Dinner With You.,,,,,
,394,The Service Once We Were At Dinner Was Very Good  As Was The Food.  We Had Booked Your Gourmet Package  And I Telephoned To Check That A Table Would Be Reserved  As It Wasn't Mentioned On My Confirmation Email  And I Was Asked What Time We Would Like To Eat And Told That A Table Had Been Reserved.  When We Checked In  The Receptionist Noticed That We Were Eating And Checked That We Were Still Happy With Our 8Pm Reservation  Which We Were.  On Arrival At The Restaurant They Had No Record Of Our Reservation  And The Maitre D Was Rather Condescending To Begin With  As He Obviously Thought We Were Hotel Guests Who Had Assumed We Would Be Able To Eat.  He Said That He Could Arrange For Us To Eat In The Sitting Room.  I Said That We Weren't Happy With This  As We Believed We Had A Table Booked In The Restaurant.  He Said He Was Sorry But We Didn't And There Was Nothing He Could Do.  I Said That We Had Booked A Table With Our Room  And Had Chosen To Stay At The Capital This Time Because We Wanted To Eat In The Restaurant  And As We Had Booked A Table I Didn't Think We Should Be The Ones To Lose Out - The Atmosphere In The Restaurant Is A Big Part Of The Experience.  At Some Point He Checked With Reception And From Then His Manner Changed And He Was Very Apologetic And Offered Us A Glass Of Champagne While We Waited For A Table To Become Available.  We Sat Down Around 9.20 (Our Booking Had Been For 8).  We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Meal  So I Am Sorry That I Have Ticked 'Poor' For The Overall Experience - This Was Purely Because Of The Mix Up With The Booking  And Because We Were Made To Feel Very Awkward To Start With.  The Duty Manager Came And Apologised Again When We Were Checking Out  And Was Very Pleasant  But She Seemed To Have Been Given The Idea That The Booking Had Somehow Got Lost  And The Receptionist (Who Was The Same Lady Who Had Checked Us In) Had To Point Out That The Table Reservation Had Certainly Been On Her System.  I Would Like To Mention That The Sommelier (An Austrian Lady) Is An Asset To You - She Was So Enthusiastic And Knowledgeable  And Seemed To Be At Every Table At Exactly The Right Moment.  She Was Delightful.  ,,,,,
,401,I Had The Set Lunch.  Delicious From Start To Finish.  Service Was Excellent Too.,,,,,
,402,Very Good,,,,,
,408,Professional  Thorough  Diligent,,,,,
,409,We Liked The Restaurant  But Thought It Was Pricey For What It Is -- Very Good  But Unspectacular Food In Small Portions.  We Would Eat There Again For Conveneince  But Would Not Seek It Out If We Were Staying Elsewhere.,,,,,
,410,We Had Lunch In Your New Fish Restaurant  We Enjoyed The Food In The Restaurant As It Was Before.,,,,,
,420,I Wonder If On The Menu At Outlaws If One Or Two Entrees Of More Well Known Fish Such As Salmon Or Halibut Could Be Offered?,,,,,
,423,Waiting 45 Minutes In An Empty Bar For 1 Lettuce Tomato And Onion Sandwich And 1 Carpachio Of Beef Salad  Is Far Too Long To Wait And Staff Were Not Very Friendly After I Asked For The 3Rd Time Where Our Food Was!,,,,,
,424,We Did Prefer The Last Chef.,,,,,
,433,We Have Always Received Excellent From Ceasar And The Bar Staff,,,,,
,434,Not Much Of A Choice Of Fish For A Seafood Restaurant,,,,,
,441,Our Dining Was Spoilt By The Fact That We Weree Served A Wrong Dish As A Main Course. My Wife Asked Me Not To Complain And Ate The Dish Which Was Ok But With Hindsight I Wish I Had Complained.,,,,,
,443,Did Not Dine In The Hotel As I Did Not Like The Menu.,,,,,
,444,My Starter Was Microscopic (Mackeral Based) - Quite Unacceptably Minuscule - I Thought It Was A (Small) Amuse Bouche  Really. Re: Breakfast  The Butter In The Little Dishes Was Not Chilled And The Earl Grey Tea Was Made Far Too Strong (The Filter In The Pot Was Filled To Excess For This Tea). Also You Should Consider Discouraging Guests From Using Electronic Devices Which Emit Bleeps - Very Disconcerting And Bad Manners.,,,,,
,450,We Felt Rather More Interesting Bread Could Be Used For The Toast.,,,,,
,451,Perhaps Wider Menu Choice Would Be Beneficial. Pretty Expensive Especially Wine List.,,,,,
,452,The Food And Wine Choices At Outlaw's Was Superb  And The Chef's Ability To Easily Work Within My Wife's Gf Requirements Was Welcome By Us Both. World-Class Food And Service !,,,,,
,458,Haven't Been To The New Restaurant - Really Liked The Old One.,,,,,
,460,The Fish Was Not Fresh.,,,,,
,461,Serving Staff Were Particularly Pleasant And Alert To Refilling Water  Offering Assistance And Alert To My Needs.,,,,,
,465,We Had Breakfast Every Day And Found Evrything We Could Wish For  Whilst The Service Was Very Good.,,,,,
,467,Breakfast Is Always Something We Look Forward To At The Capital,,,,,
,479,I Particularly Liked Not Being Endlessly Chased For My Room Number  This Reflects Well On Your Staff.,,,,,
,488,See My Earlier Comments,,,,,
,492,Only Breakfast In The Room But It Was Fine.,,,,,
,498,The Waiter At Dinner Was Excellent.  However  The Waiter At Breakfast Seemed A Little Confused.,,,,,
,499,Your Bar/Dining Staff Went Out Of Their Way To Accommodate Us In Every Way.,,,,,
,503,We Had No Idea That The Metro Was Part Of The Hotelâ´S Restaurants!!!!!,,,,,
,507,Breakfast Was Chaotic.  Staff Not As Well Trained As We Remember.  Dinner Food Was Just Ok  Again  Less Good Than We Remember.,,,,,
,512,We Had Just Drinks In The Bar (No Food) And Breakfast In The Morning.,,,,,
,516,Your Hotel Is Truly Boutique. We Have Been In The Adlon In Berlin  Fitzwilliam In Dublin  The Howard In London  And The Sheraton In Sydney  Which Are All Marvellous  But Not As Comfortable As Yours.,,,,,
,518,Our Stay With You Was Only Marred By Slow  Poor Service And Clearly Inadequate Training Of Staff In The Dining Room  For Both Breakfast And The Evening Meal.,,,,,
,519,Satisfactory,,,,,
,521,We Miss The Privious Restaurant.,,,,,
,523,The Lunch Menu Was Discussed In Great Detail. We Didn't Feel The Chef Understood Our Needs 100%. One Of Our Guests Didn't Eat Shellfish And Chef Suggested She Had Cod  When The Second Course Was To Be Sea Bass. We Thought That Was A Little Unimaginative.,,,,,
,530,Need Fresh Fruit For Breakfast Need Non-Fat Yoghurt For Breakfast,,,,,
,534,Very Slow Bar Service--Perhaps Too Crowded And Busy. Excellent Waitress But Kitchen Too Slow,,,,,
,536,We Also Dined At The Metro And Enjoyed The Simpler Food Also.The Staff Were Friendly And Professional.,,,,,
,537,The Room Service Breakfast Was Excellent.,,,,,
,540,Breakfast On Leaving Was A Disaster. Ordered Fried Eggs With Tomato And Mushroom And White Toast And After A Ridiculous Wait  No One Else In The Dining Room At The Time Of Order  Poached Eggs Were Delivered Instead. Having Had My Order Taken It Was Quite Irritating To Be Asked By Other Attendees Not Once But Twice For My Breakfast Order. When My Order Finally Arrived My Cold White Toast Was Grabbed Away To Be Replaced With Warm Brown Toast White,,,,,
,549,Dont Like Did Restaurant,,,,,
,576,Dining Experience We Found Food Only Fair As Already Mentioned To Your Receptionist On Our Departure. Food Cold And Fish Greasy House Wine Good Value,,,,,
,581,We Don't Drink   But Found All The Staff Most Pleasant,,,,,
,603,I've Been Staying At The Capital For Quite A Few Years Now  And I've Always Found The Bar To Be Slightly Dark And Lifeless  This Could Be Resolved Quite Simply By Introducing Lights On The Shelves Behind The Bottles Of Spirit  This Would Create A Much More Vibrant Environment As Well As Reflecting The Light Through The Coloured Glass.    Also Having Breakfast And Dinner Didn't Match The Quality That I Remembered And Had Come To Expect From The Hotel  'Which In The Past  Was Exceptional.,,,,,
,614,Breakfast Could Be Improved By Serving Fresh Fruit  Instead Of Fruit Salad.  The Coffee Could Be Improved By Purchasing An Italian Espresso Maker For The Restaurant.,,,,,
,624,We Ordered Port Late In The Evening But Didn't Realize How Expensive It Was Until We Went To Pay The Bill. A Heads Up Would Have Been Appreciated.,,,,,
,650,We Were Disappointed With The Quality Of The Dishes And The Execution In Outlaw's.  The Composition Of The Dishes Needed More Work: Some Combinations Were Odd And Execution Was Poor.  As Nathan Outlaw At Rock Holds 2 Michelin Stars Our Expectations Were High And Were Not Met.,,,,,
,651,Having Experienced Nathan Outlaw's In Cornwall Which Was Great We Were Not Disappointed  We Were Made A Real Fuss Of By Julia Who Served Us In The Restaurant. She Made It Very Special.,,,,,
,666,Just Had Tea There L Time  And Breakfast L Time; Ate At Metro 3 X,,,,,
,676,No,,,,,
,682,None,,,,,
,683,The Italian Maitre D Is Fabulous. Sometimes Breakfast Staff Don't Speak Great English,,,,,
,689,No,,,,,
,704,Food. Was.  Very Poor  The Rack Of Lamb  Very Disappointing And Was Served On A Cold Plate,,,,,
,714,No,,,,,
,719,Great Drinks/Bartender,,,,,
,733,These Comments Apply To Restaurant Only. Bar Service And Bar Snacks Were Very Good.   Our Breakfast Experience On Both Mornings Was Ok At Best. Service Was Haphazard And Some Cooked Breakfast Items Were Like Warm.   Outlaw's For Dinner On Sat Night Was Very Poor. Service Was Slow. We Sat Down At 8.20 After Drinks In Bar. Starters Were Served At 2055. Then An Interminable Wait Til 2130 For Mains. Worse Still One Main Course Was Not What Had Been Ordered. Item Was Taken Back And Correct Plate Deld. Food Ok. Luke Warm.   Evening Menu Is Limited. We Appreciate It's A Seafood Speciality Restaurant But No Veggie Options And Only One Meat Choice  A Very Strongly Flavoured Smoked Venison Steak.   Overall Very Disappointing.   To Put It Into Perspective   On Prev Visits To The Capital  Albeit Some Time Ago  We Had What My Wife  Son (Then Aged About 11) And I Feel Was Our Best Ever Family Meal Out   On That Occasion Service And Food Were Superb. This Time It Was A 3/10 Meal.,,,,,
,742,The Food In Outlaws Was Really Good  But The Salad In The Bar Were Not That Good.,,,,,
,743,Prawn Cocktail Very Bland And Quite Soggy Prawns.,,,,,
,765,Very Friendly Service 
Lunch Was Extremely Good Value And Quite Delicious
I Could Do Without Being Able To See Into The Kitchen ( Not Stylish At All ) Maybe One Way Glass Would Work Better
The Dining Room Was Much More Chic In Its Last Carnation !
There Is A Hole In The Carpet Next To Where We Were Sitting  The Carpet Should Either Be Replaced Or The Damaged Part Hand Sewn By A Good Carpet Fitter.,,,,,
,783,Owing To A Faulty Valve In The Heating System  The Temperature In The Restaurant Was Sky-High - In Fact The Butter With The Bread Melted Within One Minute  And After A While Tasted A Little Rancid !. I Appreciate That It Would Be Difficult To Get Repair Staff In Late In The Day But It Was Very Uncomfortable. This Lack Of Comfort As Regards The Temperature Extended To Breakfast Time On Wednesday 27/11. There Was Also A Slight Effect On The Upstairs Bedroom Areas.,,,,,
,789,All Of The Staff Were Extremely Helpful,,,,,
,792,The Outlaws Is A Seafood Restaurant Only
We Get Superior Seafood In. Norway Thus Not Dining At The Outlaws
However  At Breakfast A Strong Smell Of Fish Appeared Which Should Not Be There If All Was Fresh And Clean !!,,,,,
,794,Fabulous Food And Service Knowledgable And Socially Skilled Waiters With First Hand Experience Of The Dishes Served.,,,,,
,795,Or Dinner On Saturday We Had The Tasting Menu Which We Thoroughly Enjoyed  However The Hungarian Wine With The Lobster Risotto Was Not Terribly Good. Whilst A The Wine Seemed To Be Selected To Balance With The Orange In The Sauce It Was Not A Great Flavour. Te Sauvignon Blanc With The First Course Was Excellent As Was The Italian Pudding Wine With The Chocolate  My Wife Had The Tokaji  Which Was Of Course Brilliant. However She Did Not Care For The Light Italian With The Pineapple Dish. We Also Thought 2 Deserts Was One Too Many. ,,,,,
,798,All Excellent ;Good Variety Of Menus To Suit Different Tastes And Budgets At All Times Of Day ,,,,,
,807,Although Service Was Very Friendly We Thought At Times It Was Not As Slick As It Might Be.,,,,,
,814,No,,,,,
,818,Monkfish Was Delicious Best I've Ever Tried.  Breakfast Was Lovely Too.,,,,,
,820,Please Could Mr. Outlaw Provide A Larger Jacket For His Front Of House/Head Waiter. A Delightful Young Man And Whilst We Do Realise That Outlaw's Has A More Relaxed Atmosphere Than Previous He  Really Did Deserve To Look Smarter. Just A Very Small Point But He Carried Out His Work To A Very High Standard And The Food Was Superb.  ,,,,,
,821,Afternoon Tea  Bread Used To Make Sandwiches Was Stale. Vegetarian Fillings Were Poor And Uninspiring.,,,,,
,825,We Were Looked After Brilliantly. Staff We're Very Kind To The Children. We Did Not Stay At The Capital But Spend Christmas Day In A Private Dining Room At Outlaws.,,,,,
,828,Our Requests For Certain Tables  Which We Were Familiar With Were Met   Which We Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,832,Excellent!,,,,,
,840,Outlaws Was Up To The High Standard We Have Experienced Over Recent Years. However  Breakfast Was Not As Expected For Such A High Value Hotel.,,,,,
,842,Your Staff Are Delightful. Nothing Is Too Much Trouble For Them. I Could Not Have Asked For Better Attention. ,,,,,

,21,None,,,,,
,26,The Concierge Was Wonderful.. Really Took The Time To Explain The Map And Where We Should Go And What We Should See. Also Looked Up Events Going On In The City So We Could Avoid Them. Truly Attentive Service. Bellhops Were Also Very Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,
,31,The Concierge Graham Was Extremely Helpful And Knowledgeable.  The Gentleman Who Cheerfully Served Breakfast Every Morning Was Also Very Nice And Helpful. We Really Appreciated His Friendliness And Attentiveness - Especially When My Daughter Managed To Spill Her Hot Chocolate All Over Herself And The Sofa.,,,,,

,58,The Majority Of My Stay Was Faultless  Although There Was One Aspect Which I Found Very Embarrasing Which I Brought Up At Check Out.  On The Evening Of My Stay We Returned To The Hotel At 11.30Pm For A Nightcap.  We Found That The Bar Was Closed And The Duty Manager Informed Us That It Would Not Be Opening Because There Were No Guests.  We Politely Advised That We Were Guests But He Just Apologised And Re-Iterated There Were No Guests.  Amongst Our Party Was Our Company Chairman And An Important Client We Had Just Taken Out For Dinner.  I Felt Extremely Embarrased As I Had Arranged The Evening And Accommodation.,,,,,
,59,Unfortunately Can't Remember Her Name But The Waitress In The Restaurant French I Think  Really Lovely Always Smiling And Very Helpful.,,,,,
,63,The Girl That Checked Me In  Was Excellent As Were The Concierge Guys And Door Person.,,,,,
,65,All Front Of House Staff Were Very Friendly And Extremely Helpful.,,,,,
,66,Concierge Was Not Attentive With No Smile. Reception Was Always 'Upon Request' (I.E. I Always Had To Get Their Attention First To Be Served).,,,,,
,70,Everyone Very Friendly And Helpful,,,,,
,75,Generally Good Staff :),,,,,
,78,The Team At The Front Desk: Very Nice And Helpful,,,,,
,80,Too Many To Count! Julie  The Sommelier - Incredible Knowledge And Bundles Of Enthusiasm. Francesca  The Waitress - So Friendly. Cesar In The Bar. Claudio In The Bar. Lorena (She Has A Hint Of Eccentricity That We Loved!). There Were Several Others That We Spoke To Daily But Didn't Get Their Names - The Wonderful 'House Mother' At Breakfast (Very Soothing)  The Mongolian Barman And The Indian Manager (From Mumbai I Think).,,,,,
,82,They Were All Excellent. My Hat Goes Off To Your Doorman Who Ran Round The Block To Find A Taxi For Us On Saturday Night. I Suspect He Is A Long Serving  Trusty Member Of The Team  And Vital As The First And Last Link To The Hotel.   ,,,,,
,83,The Doorman Was Excellent. Sorry  I Can't Recall His Name. We Had An Enormous Amount Of Luggage And He Really Went Out Of His Way To Assist Us With It Upon Arrival And Departure. I Chose 'Agree' For 'Attentive To Our Needs' Above Because When My Husband Phoned About The Wi-Fi Issue The Staff Member Wasn't Helpful At All. There Was No Proposed Solution Or Follow-Up Which Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,85,The Door Man And The Concierge,,,,,
,86,Everyone Was Beyond Nice To Us During Our Stay Especially We Had 4 Small Children In Our Group.  I Definitely Consider Coming Back And Staying With You.  The Only Thing I Suggest Improvement On Is That We Asked The Concierge About Getting Tickets To Buckingham Palace And He Said That Their Office Was Closed And We Couldn't Do Anything Until It Opens.  At The Time When We Asked  We Knew It Was Closed.  But  We Were Looking For Suggestions Or At Least Try To Be Helpful.,,,,,
,89,I Have A Complain About Getting A Taxi After Mid Night. This Is A Five Star Hotel And It Doesn't Make Sense That The Guest Must Go And Find A Taxi Themselves!,,,,,
,95,The Concierge Was Helpful During Our Stay. Our Assistant Attempted To Reach Out Prior To Our Arrival And The Email Was Returned After We Had Arrived And Made Other Arrangements.,,,,,
,98,All Of Them  Specially Cesar(Bar)Lorena(Reception)Patricia And Jenifer,,,,,
,103,Graham - Very Helpful And Good Fun With It,,,,,
,108,I Don't Know His Name  But A Young Man Who Was The Concierge  Very Nice And Very Friendly.,,,,,

,117,The One That Takes Reservation When Call Inn /,,,,,
,118,Graham And Clive. Both Sorted Out Tow Books For My Wife/Saved Me Alot Of Time,,,,,
,120,Your Entire Team Does A Great Job. Jennifer Was Very Helpful With Reservations. Graeme Is Always So Helpful Also  As Is The Gentleman Who Hosts/Manages The Morning Breakfast.,,,,,
,125,The Polish Women Who Cleaned Our Rooms.  I Had An Emergency And They Catered For My Needs....Wonderful I Cannot Thank Them Enough.  All Were Lovely.  The Receptionist.  The Guy From India Too.  He Stood Out. He Apologised So Much For Giving Me The Wrong Room.  It Was Not The Wrong Room.  We Just Felt Isolated At The Top Of The Building! He Was Wonderful And Spoilt Us.  Very Nice And Constantly Helpful.  We Bought Him Desert One Night After Being At Metro.  We Could Not Thank Him Anymore Than We Could.  Sharon  A Canadian Lady From The Restaurant Who Was So Efficient To Squeeze Us In The Dinning Room For Lunch On Christmas Day.  She Was Efficient And Made Sure We Could Eat There.  I Need To Thank Her Again Really.  So All In All A Good Stay!,,,,,
,127,You Have Excellent Staff. They Made Me Feel Welcome.,,,,,
,128,All The Team  The Bar Staff  The Door Chaps  Concierge  All Those In The Background As Always Cesar Takes Very Good Care Of Us  You All Do  Thank You.,,,,,

,152,All Seemed Equally Helpful And Keen To Assist,,,,,
,153,Graham  The Concierge  The Doorman And All The Staff At The Front Desk Were Wonderful.,,,,,
,159,One Consierge Was Very Pleasant And Patient (I Had 5 16 Year Old Girls Staying With Me)  The Other (Day Time  Italian/Spanish?) I Felt Was Looking Down On Us And Gave The Girls (Dressed As All 16 Year Olds Do) Some Very Rude  Unfriendly Looks. The Doorman Was Absolutely Lovely As Were All The Reception Staff.,,,,,
,160,The Cocktail Barman During Our Stay Was Very Helpful And Gave Our Son  Who Is Interested In This  A Lot Of Helpful Advice.  Also  He Suggested And Made A Variety Of Very Good Cocktails  And His Friendly Approach And Easy Going Style Made It A Very Pleasant Evening.,,,,,
,162,The Door Man Was So Very Helpful And Extremely Knowledgeable,,,,,
,165,All Excellent. Front Of House Particularly Helpful With Luggage Etc.,,,,,
,168,All Were Excellent  A Class!,,,,,
,169,As Already Explained  The Service Is Over-Done. I Was Stopped By Someone In The Hallway (It Might Have Been The Consierge) To Interrogate Me If I Would Need A Taxi For The Next Morning Or Something Else. It Seems To Me That There Is Too Much Service Personnel Looking For Something To Do (And Make Extra Money). Service Personnel  Especially A Consierge Should Be Very Discrete And Only Reply To My Needs And Not To His Needs. Overall  I Had The Feeling That I Am There To Fulfill The Needs Of The Service Personnel And Noth The Other Way Around. This Was Magnified By The Small Room In The Entry Hall.,,,,,
,170,The Unsung Heros Of House Keeping.,,,,,
,175,Very Good  Liliana Peixoto.,,,,,
,177,Young French Gentleman Very Helpful And Attentive.  All Team Very Very Helpful And Responsive,,,,,
,179,The Porter Who Took Us To The Room Made No Effort To Make Us Feel Welcome And When I Asked Questions He Could Not Help!!!! The Breakfast Team Also Let You Down  No Attention At 7Am  Had To Ask For Everything,,,,,
,180,Chris On The Door Is Amazing Ceasar Is Alaways The Best Also !!,,,,,
,181,The Team At The Concierge Desk...On My First Day They Knew Who I Was And My Room Number,,,,,
,182,We Commend Everyone - It Really Is Top Notch Service And So Difficult To Single One Person Out!,,,,,
,187,From Doorman And Porters To Wait Staff And Chambermaids  All Are Well Trained And Contribute Greatly To The Other Successful Aspects Of The Hotel Such As The Location  Physical Plant And Price Point.

,236,Didn't Get Her Name  But An Austrian Young Lady In The Restaurant Had A Very Relaxed  Yet Efficient Manner About Her.,,,,,
,237,After Leaving The Hotel I Thought I Left My Glasses In The Room.  I Called The Hotel And Spoke To Justyna.  She Was Extremely Helpful And Emailed Me Several Times To Follow Up. It Turns Out I Found My Glasses In My Suitcase But Her Concern  And Her Professional Yet Friendly Manner Speaks Wonders For The Hotel.  I Hope To Return To The Hotel For Many Reasons But Most Importantly To Personally Thank Justyna.  Lisa Milbank,,,,,

,266,All The Staff Are Very Friendly From The Moment You Step Out Of Your Taxi  Throughout The Whole Stay,,,,,

,268,It Is Hard To Specify One Specific Member Of The Team As Everyone Made Us Feel Welcome.  Great Job To Everyone At The Capital!,,,,,
,271,Danielle In The Bar Was Very Sweat And Kind To Us.,,,,,
,272,Both Clive And Bruno  Especially  Do A Great Job Of Treating You As If You Are The Most Important Guest.,,,,,

Concierge Very Helpful And Knowledgeable-- Only Glitch Was The Individual On Duty On Friday (I Believe  Not Sure Of Date-- Not Clive) Explained To Us The Difference Between Fast Track And Regular Tickets For The London Eye-- The Individual Who Obtained Them Did Not Get Fast Track Tickets  Despite Our Discussion. Not A Big Deal Since We Easily Exchanged And The Difference On Sunday. The Housekeeping Staff Was Really Good-- Making Sense Of The Chaos Caused By Our Otherwise Charming Fifteen Year Old Daugher.,,,,,
,290,Doorman  Main Concierge Person And The Check-In Supervisor.  Unfortunately  I Don't Have Any Names But Wish I Had Asked For Them  They Were All So Impressive.,,,,,

She Was Terrific.,,,,,
,822,Our Experience Was That Every Staff Member Working During Our Stay Were Professional And Extremely Personable.  No One Member Was Better Than The Other.  In Fact Your Staff Are A Very Impressive Group Of People.,,,,,
,824,Francesca  Sharon At The Restaurant Were Very Attentive And Cesar (If I Remember Well His Name) At The Bar Was Very Professional.,,,,,
,825,Laura For Reasons Already Stated And The Staff Who Looked After Us In Our Private Dining Room. Excellent.,,,,,
,827,Everyone Was Extremely Polite And Accommodating.  By The End Of The First Full Day They Knew Us By Name And Handed Us Our Correct Key Without Asking.,,,,,
,832,I Thank Liliana For Helping Us With Our Reservation.  The Young Man Who Brought Our Bags And Showed Us To The Room Was Especially Gracious And Accommodating.  He Set The Tone For A Lovely Stay.,,,,,
,839,Chris Who Is Always So Welcoming  And "Dino" [I Don't Think I Have The Correct Name} On Reception  For Similar Reasons  And Because  Although I Stay In The Hotel Very Infrequently  It Always Feels That I Am Returning To A Family.,,,,,
,842,No Everyone Polite And Extremely Helpful,,,,,

,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,
,9,No  The Staff And Hotel Are Both Always Very Pleasing And Of A High Quality.,,,,,
,10,No It Was Good Thank You.,,,,,
,19,Yes Please. 2 Things To Improve: - The Internet Connection (Speed And Methodology) - The Room Key (Came On  We Are On The 21 Century We Can Change The Size Of The Key Ring).,,,,,
,21,None,,,,,
,27,The Interior Design & Decoraton The Key Chain,,,,,
,31,The Rooms Could Be A Bit Brighter. The Bathroom Water Pressure Could Be Improved And The Bathroom Felt A Bit Cramped Overall.,,,,,
,33,None,,,,,
,37,Cleaning Unfortunately Was A Bit Disappointing  There Were Saucepans Which Were Dirty. I Think For The Price Of The Room It Would Be Good To Have Cleaning (Just A Basic One Hour Or So) Twice Or Three Times Per Week.,,,,,
,58,Again  I Would Love To Say That It Exceeded Expectations But Becuase Of The Bar Issue I Can't.  I Would Be Able To Get A Drink At That Time Of Night In A Bar At A Holiday Inn!,,,,,
,60,No,,,,,
,63,Had A Great Experience Except At Check Out The Girl Printed The Bill For The Wrong Room And Took A While To Work It Out. That Was A Bit Annoying.,,,,,
,64,Bigger Room,,,,,
,66,If You Could Have Added The Excellent Quality Of The Doorman At The Savoy  The Attentive Service At The Reception At The Dorchester  The Well-Trained Manners And Politeness At The Ritz  And The Good Team-Spirit To Make Guests Feel Welcome At The Goring  This Would Greatly Have Improved Our Experience.,,,,,
,70,Yes,,,,,
,72,Bedrooms Could Do With Modernising/Titivating.,,,,,
,75,Internet Is The Main Disadvantage  128 Kbps Is What You Offer And It Was Very Very Slow! It Is The Worst Internet Service I Ever Experienced In My Life. Even After Upgrading Internet To The Business Offer  Which Costed Me 18 Gbp A Day  The Service Was 512 Kbps Which Again Very Very Slow And Doesn't Match What I Payed For!,,,,,
,80,I'm Scraping The Barrel For Criticisms Here But If I'm Being Very Nit-Picky: There Is Quite A Bad Tear In The Dining Room Carpet. The Breakfasts Weren't Quite Of The Same Standards As Other Food That You Serve. It's Lovely Having The Selection Of Kippers  Haddock Etc But Maybe The Fruit Salad Could Be A Little More 'Exotic' And Inventive  Perhaps The Juices Might Feature A 'Guest Juice' Each Morning  The Yoghurts Could Perhaps Be In More Unusual Flavours. The Full English Breakfast Was Unexceptional  Nothing Wrong With It  Just Didn't Blow Us Away Like The Rest Of The Food.,,,,,
,82,Knowing Beforehand Basil Street Was One Way May Have Helped Slightly.,,,,,
,83,The Wi-Fi Issue Was The Only Problem We Encountered. I Can't Recall Our Room Number If You'd Like To Investigate This However The Booking Was Under Katy Paterson. Overall We Had A Very Nice Stay At The Capital.,,,,,
,86,Can't Think Of Anything:),,,,,
,87,Maybe Put Some Water In The Room And I'm Pretty Sure I Was Meant To Get A Bottle Of Wine But Didn't  My Fault I Should Have Asked.,,,,,
,90,I Prefer The Levin.,,,,,
,95,Complementary Water & Ice During Turn Down Would Be Nice. We Had To Ask For It A Few Times.,,,,,
,98,The Internet Could Be Quicker,,,,,
,108,We Weren't Given Water In Our Room At Night Time And We Had To Ask For Some Dirty Glasses To Be Removed From Our Room From The Night Before.  We Were Surprised That The Housekeeper Hadn't Removed Them.,,,,,
,110,I Think The Bedrooms And Bathrooms Need Modernising A Little.,,,,,
,111,I Am Still A Very Happy Client,,,,,
,115,Quicker Costfree Internet,,,,,
,117,I Think You Have Too Many Different Type Of Nationalities Among Your Staff. Not All Of Them Seems To Go So Well Together.,,,,,
,118,A Rolls To Heathrow...,,,,,
,120,Bring Back The Kiehls Bath Products In The Rooms. What Happened This Time? There Were No Kiehls  Only Bulgari And Other.,,,,,
,125,It Is All About Experience. I Studied Architecture And While I Stayed In Your Hotel I Really Thought About It. I Am Settling Here In Europe After Living In Australia.  I Am Scottish But My Travels Has Made Me Quite A Different Traveller Now. So This Is Not A Criticism But Things I Noticed Since I Am A Designer.   You Have All Your Bottles Of Gorgeous Kiel Products Sitting On The Window And I Notice They Are Slowly Eating Into The Paintwork On The Window Sill. Maybe A Dish Underneath Would Stop This Happening.  It Just More Paintwork To Be Done Which Could Be Averted.  The Bath Robes Seemed A Little Small Not As Sumptuous And Thick As I Wish They Would Be.  I Think They May Have Been A Bit Old.  But I Know I Need To Lose A Few Kilos! But They Were Not That Generous And So Were Awkward To Use.  There Is Always One Surface To Put Your Suitcase On But What About The Other One...I Feel Its Necessary To Have The Suitcase At The Height That You Don't Have To Bend On The Floor.  But The Decoration Was Lovely And Everything Was Great.  I Hope You Do Not Feel I Am Being Rude About The Things I Have Mentioned As I Will Come And Stay Again.,,,,,
,126,It Was The High Tea Experience.  It Taints The Overall Memories Of The Hotel.  Should We Have Said Something When We Were Seated? Probably Yes.  I Think We Would Have Felt Even Worse Being Moved And It Was Our Last Day In London.  My Suggestion Is That When A Booking Is Made You Need To Clarify With The Guest That They Will Be Placed In A Conference Room So They Can Make The Choice.,,,,,
,128,We Must Stay Longer Next Time !,,,,,
,129,I Tried A Couple Of Occasions Over A Week To Speak To The Manager Without Success. I Am Not Sure If The Message Was Recieved In A Timely Fashion.,,,,,
,133,Having Stayed At The Capital Each Time We Visit London  This Year We Had 2 Rooms As We Bought The Children. A Larger Room For Us Would Have Been Lovely.,,,,,
,136,No Bottled Water Next To The Bed In The Room  Not Enough Shampoo  Shower Gel Etc.,,,,,
,137,Breakfat Experience Needs A Bit Of Attention  Either Have A Buffet Or Don`T As There Existing Set Up Is 'Thin ',,,,,
,139,Don't Overdo The Welcoming  The Staff Is Courteuous And Helpful From Itself.,,,,,
,140,No.,,,,,
,145,The Sink Has Two Water Taps  Hot And Cold. This Is A Bit Difficult During Winter As The One Would Be Very Cold While The Other Is Very Hot. Would Be Great To Have Only One Tap That Can Flow Out Mixed Cold And And Hot Water As To The Taste Of User.,,,,,
,155,No.,,,,,
,157,Just I Did Not Sleep Due To Noice Of Equipment Outside My Room,,,,,
,159,Find My Kindle- I Left It In The Room  Phoned Immediately I Noticed (2 Hours Later). The Housekeeping Staff Were Unable To Find It.,,,,,
,161,Block The Light From Entering The Bedroom,,,,,
,165,Shower Was Adequate Only In Our Room 232. Would Be Nice To Be Able To Dim Lighting Close To The Bed For Reading Without Disturbing Partner.,,,,,
,167,I Don't Like The New Black Pudding For Breakfast- Bring Back The Old French Style!,,,,,
,168,Just The Bathrooms. Also Nxt Time I Would Look Fr A Slightly Bigger Room.,,,,,
,169,It Should Be Made Clear To People Before They Book This Hotel That This Is A Place Only For People Who Love It Over-Serviced And Fancy In The Restaurant. I Think It Is Ok To Differentiate And To Create Its Own Characteristic For A Hotel But It Must Be Absolutely Clear Before Guest Arrive. Otherwise  People Get Frustrated. In Summary  The Service Which Was Offered Did Not Add Any Value To Me And The Service I Was Looking For Was Not Offered By The Hotel. I Was In The Wrong Hotel.,,,,,
,171,We Were Disappointed With The Tired And Fairly Bland Decor In Our Junior Suite  And Having Recently Stayed At Claridges  The Connaught  The Dorchester And Four Seasons Park Lane  Feel That The Capital Has Some Catching Up To Do In This Regard. Service As Always Was Excellent.,,,,,
,174,I Ordered Breakfast Using The Preprinted Note & Left It Outside The Room  Breakfast Never Arrived. The Telegraph Did  But No Breakfast. And No Tea Making Facilities Despite An Earlier Request. The Receptionist Was Helpful On Checking Out  And Offered Food But I Had To Leave By 11Am.,,,,,
,177,Internet Speed Asked For Sheets And Blanket Rather Than Duvet,,,,,
,178,Make Sure Your Hotel Has Fast And Easy To Use Unlimited Internet!!!,,,,,
,180,More Varied Menu At Outlaws To Allow More Use As Previously Discussed   Wifi Needs To Be Simpler!!,,,,,
,182,I Would Prefer Your Bed And Breakfast Rate To Include Full English Rather Than Continental.  I Know The Supplement Is Very Small But It Does Seem A Little Penny Pinching On A Â£370 Room!  However  When The Supplement Was Explained To Me I Was Happy To Pay  But Your Receptionist Was Extremely Courteous And Immediately Removed The Supplement From My Bill.  I Promise I Will Pay It Next Time!,,,,,
,193,Compared With Our Previous Stays The Room Was Satisfactory  As Opposed To Impressive.  For The Price I Expect First Class Service With Great Attention To Detail...For Example I Was Unable To Get The Room Service And Had To Dial Reception And Then It Took A While For Someone To Answer.  At Breakfast We Did Not Have Napkins On The Table And Had To Remind Staff Of Our Order / Chase For Toast And Coffee Refill.,,,,,
,194,For What I Paid  You Are Way Over Priced. Restaurant Was Closed On Sunday  Elevator Was Hard To Put Bags In  Internet Was Slow  Had To Call Room Service For Ice  Only One Room Key For A Family Of Four  Tub In Bathroom Is So High It's A Danger To Get In And Out Of  The List Goes On......,,,,,
,198,See Previous Comment About Our Bathroom And Products,,,,,
,199,Paid Attention To The Details Of The 'Requirements' Sheet Faxed To Me By The Hotel And Duly Returned. I Had Requested In Room Tea And Coffee Making Facilities As I Had A Very Early Check Out  None Were Provided. I Specifically Booked A Large Car For An Airport Transfer As I Had 4 Cases Plus Hand Baggage This Was Not Specified To The Car Company,,,,,
,200,Nothing   Even The Weather Played Ball !,,,,,
,202,No All Very Good,,,,,
,205,A Bottle Of Water In The Evening Would Be Nice. Seems To Me That You Used To Do That? I May Be Wrong-,,,,,
,208,No It Was Wonderful.,,,,,
,209,I Find The Capital Is Consistently Good,,,,,
,212,The Turn Down Service Seemed To Be Done Very Early In The Evening And It Meant We Had To Tidy The Room Again Once We Returned To The Hotel Later In The Evening(S). Maybe A Choice Of Time As To When The Turn Down Is To Be Done Is A Good Idea.,,,,,
,214,The Laundry Charges Were Outrageous!! I Found It To Be Usurious And Offensive!! I Would Of Asked For A Deduction If I Would Of Had Time At Check Out.,,,,,
,216,Lower The Cost Lol,,,,,
,219,No,,,,,
,220,Room Service Breakfast Could Have Been A Bit More Enticing. And Was The Only Time We Felt Like We Were Bothering Staff Members. It Was Very Simple But Not Much Choice Offered.,,,,,
,224,If Possible To Put An Ashtray On The Entrance Of The Hotel To Avoid Littering The Pavement.,,,,,
,227,Informed That The Room Would Not Be Available At Check In Till 2Pm Even Though The Driver Picked Us Up From Airport At 11Am,,,,,
,230,Staffing At Breakfast Times,,,,,
,238,No,,,,,
,239,No !  Just Can T Wait To Come Back !,,,,,
,240,No - Everything Was Fabulous.,,,,,
,241,As Slh Club Member  I Had The Impression That This Is Not An Issue To The Capital  I Had To Remember Some Exclusive Benefits Such As Breakfast To Get It   I Did Not Ask Room Upgrade And I Did Not Get So I Guess That Should Be Informed In This Case To The Slh Members At Least An Excuse Based On Availability. Day Use Was Asked But Not Considered As A Possibility   So I Payed The Full Rate To Be Able To Work Until 6:00 Pm,,,,,
,243,The Whole Decor Needs To Be Redone And Brought Up To 2013/14 Expectations Same With The Tables And Chairs In Dining Room,,,,,
,244,The Heater/Air Conditioning In The Room Could Be Updated To Have A Digital Thermostat And Be Easier To Program.  Cable Tv With Cnn  Etc Should Be Available Or Easier To Find.,,,,,
,245,The Difficult Part......Keep It Up  It Was Wonderful..,,,,,
,247,Better Communication From Checkout And Less Sarcasm From Concierge On Moving Rooms !,,,,,
,251,It Was Fine,,,,,
,255,Bathroom To Small. No Handshower. Burn My Legs On Towelrack When I Was On Toilet. Dont Like Shower In Bathtub Etc. Bathroom Was 2-Star,,,,,
,260,Try And Do Something About The Garbage Area,,,,,
,261,Tables For Our Roomservice Breakfast. One Huge Tray Left On The Bed. My Husband Hates Eating In Bed Or On His Lap So He Left It And It Was A Bad Start To A Special Day.,,,,,
,263,The Internet Did Not Work And When You Are For Business You Need It!!!!!,,,,,
,265,Provide More Appropriate Toiletries For Female Travellers.,,,,,
,266,I Noticed That You Have Changed The Products In The Bathroom.  I Would Prefer That Kiehls Or Molton Brown  Which Have Been In The Bathroom Before  Returned.  I Would Prefer Ginger Cake  Lemon Cake And Millionaire's Shortbread Were Back On The Afternoon Tea Menu.,,,,,
,273,None,,,,,
,275,No - Our Stay Was Perfect.,,,,,
,282,See Issues Regarding Construction.  We Are Happy So See That You Are Undertaking Refurbishment However Booking Rooms This Close To Construction Is Not Respectful Of Guests.  In Addition The Contractor Did Little To Manage Containment Of Particulate And Door Through The Use Of Floor To Ceiling Poly Sheets Or Fans.  The Level Of Noise  Is Also Not Ideal Especially When Guests May Need Daytime Quiet Due To Jet Lag.,,,,,
,285,Staff At Front Desk Not As Experienced As They Could Be.  Should Not Have Initially Put Us In A Room Next To Construction.  Also Feel Like They Are Always In Training At Front Desk!,,,,,
,289,Am Having Problems Trying To Obtain A Vat Invoice In Respect Of The Accommdation  Still Waiting For Someone To Return Next Week.,,,,,
,292,Nothing!!,,,,,
,298,Better Housekeeping And Room Service.,,,,,
,300,I Think Your Standards Are Very Good  We Had A Good Rate - Therefore For A Top Rate I Would Expect A Little More Attention To Detail.,,,,,
,303,Other Than To Respond To My Earlier Criticisms:- Service The Room When We Were Out (On Saturday Morning) Provide Better Wi-Fi,,,,,
,305,Yes - Note My Comments Regarding Outlwaws,,,,,
,306,Tea And Coffee Maker In The Room,,,,,
,310,No,,,,,
,314,If You Had The Space Available A Small Exercise Area Would Be Great  The Weather Was Bad So I Was Unable To Go To The Park And Run.,,,,,
,316,Make It Stop Raining ??? :),,,,,
,320,Have Beef In The Restaurant But Yours Is A Seafood. I Know.,,,,,
,326,No,,,,,
,327,No,,,,,
,328,As Stated Previously  View And Outside Noise...,,,,,
,330,Se Comments Earlier,,,,,
,333,You Know Me And I Know You,,,,,
,336,There Was Confusion When We Departed.  I Had Made It Clear That I Was To Settle The Final Bill For All Rooms (Three) But Different Credit Cards Were Quoted In That Final Bill; The Original Bill Was Not Accurate  An Item Was Missing.  Furthermore  It Would Be Helpful To Make The Service Charge On The Bar Bill Clear On The Menu And When Signing The Bill  Then There Are No Surprises.,,,,,
,337,No Thanks,,,,,
,338,Staff Should Have Realised There Was No Mini Bar Key As We Had Chosen A Room With A Mini Bar And The Key Was Handed In Whenever We Went Out! No Recompense Offered When We Checked Out,,,,,
,339,When I Say It Met My Expectations  My Expectations Were Very High Indeed And Were Fulfilled Completely ....,,,,,
,342,Beyond Allowing Me To Stay Longer- No!,,,,,
,343,Take The Haribos Away!,,,,,
,345,Avoid Serving Leftovers To Your Guests,,,,,
,347,We Prefer To Have A Bedroom In The Main Part Of The Hotel (Getting To Old For The Stairs),,,,,
,351,Stayed Twice This Spring  One In An 'Old Room'  Still Noicy Aircondition  Once In A Refurbished Room  Nice And Friendly,,,,,
,352,The Italian Rest Manager Could Have Been A Lot More Welcoming,,,,,
,355,I Would Have Liked To See A Picture Of The Room On The Internet Prior To Arriving.  If So  I Would Have Opted For A Larger Room.,,,,,
,357,Faster Internet Connection,,,,,
,362,House Keeping Was Erratic  At Times We Would Return Late Afternoon (4Pm) And Room Was Still Not Serviced  We Would Have To Request The Room To Be Serviced When We Left Again For Dinner  This Happened More Than Once.,,,,,
,364,Strongly Improve Quality Of Breakfast!!!!,,,,,
,367,Improved Internet Access; Cookies Every Other Night?,,,,,
,370,Not Really,,,,,
,371,The Capital Is Not Changing But Its Clientele Certainly Seems To Be In A Negative Sense.,,,,,
,372,No  It Was Perfect.,,,,,
,373,Tea/Coffee Making Facilities In Room Current Menu In The Room,,,,,
,375,Better Hair Dryer And Iron,,,,,
,376,Missed A Shoe Horn In The Room,,,,,
,377,It Would Be A Good Idea To Place A Prominent Sign On The Lift In The Apartments That Guests Should Ensure That The Doors Are Fully Closed Otherwise The Lift Will Not Operate For Others. On A Few Occasions We Had To Use The Stairs As We Found That The Lift Was Not Working Because People Had Not Fully Closed The Doors.,,,,,
,379,The Only Comment We Have Is Regarding The Coffee But We Admit We Are Spoilt In Australia We Think There Should Be A Good Espresso Machine In The Bar As The Coffee Wasn't Great,,,,,
,387,More Variety Of Side Dishes At The Outlaw.,,,,,
,388,I Cannot Think Of Anything That Could Have Made Our Stay More Pleasurable. Thank You For Having Us,,,,,
,390,Our Visit In Your Hotel Was Way Beyond Our Expectations. Thank You.,,,,,
,394,Not Mixed Up Our Dinner Reservation!,,,,,
,395,Received A Better Room,,,,,
,398,None,,,,,
,400,Better Internet Connection In Room,,,,,
,401,I Would Say The Coal Fire Being Lit In The Reception  As In The Advertisement Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,408,Nothing.,,,,,
,409,Improve Your Wireless Service.,,,,,
,410,No,,,,,
,418,I Stay At The Capital Every Time I Go To London With Friends For Shows Concerts And Exhibitions. When I Made The Reservation I Asked For A Taxi To Be Available At St Pancras; On The Eve Of Our Arrival I Received A Mail To Confirm If I Wanted A Car. I Did Not Pay Attention To The Difference Taxi/Car And Indeed A Mercedes Parked At The Other End Of The Station Waited For Us And Charged Us Â£ 75.00. I Was Told By The Concierge In A Very Unpleasant Way That It Was Impossible To Book A Taxi At St Pancras. I Replied That In That Case I Should Have Been Told And I Would Have Made Alternative Arrangements. Several Of My Friends Who Stay Frequently At The Capital Have Told Me Since That They Don Not Require The Services Of The Concierge(S) Anymore  Because They Get The Feeling That They Are Being Racketed.  This Did Not Used To Be The Case And I Feel It's The Only Dark Side Of What I Consider Is One Of The Best Hotel In London On All Accounts.Having Lived In South Ken For Twenty Five Years  Most Of My Visitors Stayed In Your Hotel On My Recommandation Over The Years;  ,,,,,
,421,Only Want Our Room On 3  4  Or 5,,,,,
,433,Nothing At All. Just A Great Family Hotel Extremely Well Run. Congratulations !!,,,,,
,434,The Problem With Checkout Was The Only Time That I Have Had A Problem  Having Been A Visitor For Almost 20 Years - I Took Advantage Of Your 'Offer' On My Room And Restaurant Reservation And Somehow This Did Not Not Come Through When The Bill Appeared - And It Seemed To Be An Awful Long Time Before It Was Put Right - All Very Friendly And Pleasant But A Nuisance As I Was In A Hurry!,,,,,
,438,See Above,,,,,
,444,It Was My Wedding Anniversary And You Most Kindly Arranged A Half Of Champagne As A Surprise To Us Both. It Seems That This Was Supposed To Be In Our Room On Arrival And When Asked About It I Had To Say That It Had Not Been There! Then It Was To Be Sent To The Room But Never Got There This Time Either! In The End After A Bit Of Fuss (Not By Me) I Was Told That It Would Be Put In My Car For Me To Take Home. It's A Pity That This Generous Gesture Was Handled So Awkwardly And I Felt Embarassed About It Really Even Though No Fault Of Mine.,,,,,
,446,No,,,,,
,447,We Cancelled Five Days Before Saturday 16Th.,,,,,
,451,We Love The Bar Area But Sometimes Difficult To Get A Seat.,,,,,
,455,Update The Bathrooms....Plumbing,,,,,
,457,Met In #19 Because I Have Stayed At The Capital Previously.,,,,,
,458,-,,,,,
,460,Looked After My Repeated Requests For Clock And Soft Bed!,,,,,
,461,I Would Have Liked Some Coffee/Tea Service In The Room.,,,,,
,463,No!,,,,,
,465,I Can't Think Of Anything,,,,,
,475,Quiet Room(Which We Requested When Booking),,,,,
,495,No - Apart From The Bed !,,,,,
,498,No,,,,,
,499,I Did Have A Bit Of Trouble Working The Faucet In The Shower  But Finally Figured That Out.,,,,,
,502,On Arrivl I Was Not Asked If I Wanted A Newspaper In The Morning  My Room Was Very Small   The Corridors Were Hot  The Air Contitioning Was Not On Inthe Room And It Wasd Also Hot  There Was No Makeup Mirror In The Bthroom  I Had To Request Bottles Of Water For My Bedside. I Really Felt As If They Were Not Ready For Me Or I Had Been Given A Small Room Becaise I Was Afemale  In All A Disappointing Experience. The Concierge  When Asked What Time Harrods Closed Gave Me The Incorrect Answer After Looking It Up!! You Are Only 2 Minutes From Harrods  Surely He Should Ha Ve Known!?,,,,,
,512,No  I Guess Not.,,,,,
,514,I Ordered Tea And Coffee Tray In My Room We Had To Make A Request Every Day To Have It Replenished ,,,,,
,516,The Common Problem With All Hotels Is The Lighting In The Rooms Is Too Low,,,,,
,517,No Our Stay Was Perfect.,,,,,
,519,None,,,,,
,520,I Would Like A Walk In Shower  Not An Over Bath One.,,,,,
,521,Next Time We Will Book Directly With The Hotel.,,,,,
,527,I Enjoyed My Sea Bass At Outlaws But We Would Have Preferred Another Meat Choice - Only Venison Was Available. The Recent Award Of Michelin Star Is Certainly Justified By The Ambience Of Outlaws And The Presentation And Taste Of The Food That We Ate There.,,,,,
,531,No,,,,,
,534,No But We Were Not Hugely Impressed With The Food Considering Your Reputation,,,,,
,536,Nno We Were Very Happy With The Level Of Service,,,,,
,537,All Was Lovely!,,,,,
,541,As Previously Stated  More Hotel Information In The Apartment.,,,,,
,544,Fruit And Tea Tray In The Room Upon Arrival. Make Up The Bed Before Afternoon.,,,,,
,579,Bottled Water In The Room Is Standard These Days  Even In B&B Accommodation. If I'd Known It Was Possible To Have A Tea Tray (And Fresh Milk?) In The Room  I Would Have Asked For It.,,,,,
,581,Pillows.,,,,,
,613,The Dinner Celebration Was Due To Start At 8.15  But No Food Was  Served Until 9.15Pm And Then Only Bread.  The Canapes Were Very Small And Did Not Seem The Quantity That I Orderd.  The Food Was Served Very Slowly Until I Asked If There Was A Problem In The Kitchen,,,,,
,614,I Requested A 4:30 Am Wake Up Call One Morning Because I Needed To Catch A 7:30 Am Flight From City Airport For A Business Meeting.  Unfortunately  The Concierge On Duty That Night Forgot My Wake Up Call.  Fortunately  I Woke Up 15 Minutes Before The Taxi Arrived  And Did Not Miss My Flight.,,,,,
,644,I Was Caled Mr Several Times To My Face. I Am A Woman And That Was Not Acceptable. The Concierge And Doorman Looked At Me Blankly When I Asked For My Key. Overall  I Was Not Pleased With The Apparent Assumption That There Was No Way I Could Be A Guest There.,,,,,
,650,The Room Was A Disappointment.  Room Service Items Had To Be Placed On The Bed As The Room Was So Small There Was No Space For Even A Small Table.  I Was Unable To Order A Room Service Meal For This Reason And As A Single Traveller That Was An Inconvenience.   The Refurbishment Of The Restaurant And Less Formal Style Is Fine But The Food Offering Is Not As Good As The Cooking Of Eric Chaviot.,,,,,
,651,We Think You Have It Just Right  The Hotel Has A Wonderful Intimate Feel To It.  I Would Definitely Stay Again And Recommend Both The Hotel And Nathan Outlaw's Restaurant.,,,,,
,653,Great Hotel With Obviously Excellent Management.  Hope To Return.,,,,,
,661,Room Was Very Hot When The Air Conditioning Was Off But Very Noisy With It On!,,,,,
,666,Was Disappointed In Your Exchange Rate...Fortunately Had Cash,,,,,
,673,The Fact That My Ipad Was Removed From My Room Between 5Pm And 10 P.M. And My Question As To The Trustworthiness Of The Turndown Staff Who Were The Only People To Be In The Room Between My Going Out And Returning Around 10 P.M. When The Ipad Had Disappeared Was Not Taken Seriously.,,,,,
,676,I Am Sure I Will Think Of Something.,,,,,
,714,No,,,,,
,732,Given Me A Better Room,,,,,
,733,Bin Outlaw.,,,,,
,765,Have Water In The Room Available ,,,,,
,766,No,,,,,
,775,The Staff Were Very Polite And Feel Comfortable To Me.,,,,,
,794,Porter On Duty On Friday Later Afternoon 6/12/13 Was Not To Same Standard As The Ones On Friday 6/12/13 Around 2.30 Pm And 7/12/13 Am.
Reception Staff Was Excellent And Fast Both Days.,,,,,
,798,Yes Room Cleaning And Availability Of Tea And Coffee Facilities Needed To Be Provided Speedily And Without Reminders .,,,,,
,803,I Always Have High Expectations For The Capital Which Have Always Been Fully Met.  Accordingly  Meting Expectations Is The Highest "Grade" I Can Give.,,,,,
,807,Possibly An Ipod/Mp3 Docking Music System In The Room.,,,,,
,814,No,,,,,
,818,No,,,,,
,820,Nothing. I Have Stayed In Many Of The Extremely Expensive Hotels In London And Your Modestly Priced Establishment Beat The Others Hands Down. You Have A Little Gem. 
,,,,,
,821,Dining Tables In The Restaurant Were Set Too Close So There Was Little Privacy  I Felt A Little Uncomfortable Sitting So Near To The Neighbouring Table.,,,,,
,827,Our Room Was Near The End Of The Hall Near The Housekeeping Closet.  We Could Hear The Staff Talking With One Another Before We Arose Making It Difficult To Enjoy Those Extra Few Minutes Of Sleep One Expects While On Vacation.,,,,,
,830,Met/Fall Below. As Mentioned Staff Were Great But I Felt The Rooms Were Just Too Small And A Little Dated.,,,,,
,834,Rooms Need To Be Updated ,,,,,
,840,Outlaws Excellent But The Hotel Was Somewhat Below Our Expectations.,,,,,
,842,Given Me A Room Which Allowed Me To Get Some Sleep,,,,,

,5,The Hotel Should Keep A Big Bottled Water And 2 Glasses In The Room For Free Everyday As Most People Don't Drink From The Tap Directly. The Ritz Offers Fresh Big Bottle Everyday And A Welcome Tea Tray (By Nationality  For Example  We Were Offered Chinese Green Tea)On Arrival With Tea Pot Cups Biscuit And A Magazine In Our Language. I Personally Felt Very Warm And Sweet.,,,,,
,10,No It Was Good Thank You.,,,,,
,14,Mini Business Center.,,,,,
,21,None,,,,,
,26,Loved The Location Of The Hotel  Thank You For Having Us.,,,,,
,27,In The God Well See You All In My Next Visit To London :),,,,,
,28,Excellent Stay  We Have Found A Little Gem At The Capital And Will Definitely Be Back. Thanks To All Of The Hotel Team For Making Our Stay So Enjoyable.,,,,,
,31,I Really Loved The Homey Feel To Your Hotel. I Really Felt That All The Staff Worked As A Team Or Even A As A Family And It Reflects In The Personal Service We Experienced. The Hotel's Location Is Excellent And We Will Definitely Return If We Visit London Again.   Last But Not Least - You Supplied The Best Baby Cot. The Other Hotels That We Went To Usually Just Provide Us With A Horrible Wheeled Bed But Your Came With Matching Bumpers And Blanket Which Was Really Appreciated!,,,,,
,33,May Improve Some Facilities  For Example:Lift.,,,,,
,34,I Thought The Pillows And Mattress Was A Little Too Soft And Needed Replacing.,,,,,
,37,I Really Enjoyed Using The Gym And Carlton Towers  It Is Great That You Have That Facility,,,,,
,50,Looking Forward To Staying At The Capital Again .,,,,,
,60,None - Can't Fault The Hotel In Any Way,,,,,
,66,The Restaurant And The Bar Were Pleasant. Thank You.,,,,,
,70,Yes.  My Room Was Next To The Technical Staff Room That Holds Tools For Cleaning Or Something Like That. It Was Not Comfortable In The Morning To Hear The Sound Of The Door  As If Every Two Minutes Of This Room They Took Something. I Believe That The Work Of The Staff Should Not Be Visible  But Even More So  Is Heard As Loudly.,,,,,
,72,We Love This Hotel.,,,,,
,80,Just Thank You To All For A Simply Wonderful Stay  And We'll See You Very Soon For The Vegeterian Tasting Menu (Especially As Lorena Has Got Nathan To Sign His Cookbook For Us - So We Need To Pick It Up!).,,,,,
,82,Please Take My Comments In The Vein The Are Meant  Gentle Pointers Not Glaring Criticisms. I Rarely Fill In These Type Of Requests  But My Stay With You Was Such A Pleasure  And So Personal  I Hope You Will Benefit From Them. For Once I Stayed Away And Almost Felt I Was At A Friends House  Rather Than In A Money-Making Machine. The More I Pay  The Less I Want To Notice That!  Thank You Again For Your Kind Hospitality. Martyn,,,,,
,83,The Location Of The Capital Is Superb Particularly For Shopping And Being In A Less Crowded Area Of The City. The Staff Were Friendly And Made Us Feel Very Welcome. I'd Definitely Recommend It To Friends Visiting London. I'm Assuming The Wi-Fi Issue Was A Hiccup That Is Hopefully Being Fixed If Not Already.,,,,,
,86,No.,,,,,
,87,We Have Stayed Here Many Times And We Love It.,,,,,
,96,My Family Who Have Also Stayed Before Thought The Breakfast Was Not Very Good Quality- I Unfortunately Agree.,,,,,
,98,I Loved Um Experience At The Capital And Wanted To Thank You For Making It So Special.,,,,,
,107,This Last Visit The Continental  Breakfast Was Not As Good As Previous Visits. I Didn't Like The Display At The Bar In Comparison To The Table In The Dining Area,,,,,
,108,We Really Enjoy Staying At The Hotel And The Warm Friendly Atmosphere.  We Will Definitely Eat At Nathan Outlaw's Next Time.  Thank You.,,,,,
,110,We Love The Capital It's So Friendly Yet Very Professional. Particularly Love The Food!,,,,,
,111,Install A Decent Internet -- The Present One Is Very Unsatisfactory,,,,,
,112,Just Really Disapointed With My Room,,,,,
,117,Coming Back Soon,,,,,
,118,Overall A Superb Pair Of Hotels;I Had A Brief Dinner In The Levin Bistro..Very Nice As Well,,,,,
,121,Just An Excellence Place To Stay.,,,,,
,125,Its A Wonderful Location And You Need To Make The Most Of It I Feel.  The Reception Area Could Be Warmer. You Know The Office Area...As You Go In And Left Next To The Stairs. You Could Open That Up Through The Wall And Make The Reception Area There...That Would Give More Room By The Stairs As You Go In And So There Is More Direct Movement Possible To Go Up The Stairs.  The Stairs Is Beautiful.  Then Some Really Comfortable Deep Sinking Chairs Which Make You Feel Cocooned Would Work Better I Feel In The Reception Area While You Wait.  It Makes You Relax Before You Go To Your Room.  I Am Always Thinking About Design But It Feels To Open And Empty And Not Warm Enough For Some Reason.  I Hope You Do Not Take This The Wrong Way As It Is A Beautiful Friendly Hotel But It Could Be Warmer In My Opinion.  I Am A Trained Designer.  So I Hope This Helps. Thank You Again For Everything.,,,,,
,128,We Adore Your Hotel And Staff  And Have Done From Our First Visit When We Called In An Off The Cuff Lunch  Thats How We Found You  So Thank You For Being There.,,,,,
,129,Enjoyed Our Stay  Looking Forward To Next Saty. Thank You.,,,,,
,131,Thank You To All Your Team And Keep It Up.,,,,,
,135,For Many Years  My Wife And I Would Stay At 'The Basil Street Hotel' Where They Operated A Discount Scheme For Guests  Who Became Members Of The 'Basil Club' Once They Had Stayed On Three Occasions Within A 12 Month Period. The Discount Was Only 10%  But It Did Make You Feel You Were Being Rewarded For Your Loyalty. Having Recently Enjoyed A Pleasant Stay At 'The Capital' For A Very Fair Â£200 Per Night  I Enquired How Much It Would Be To Stay On 21St And/Or 22Nd May  Whereupon I Was Quoted Over Â£400 Per Night. Admittedly  This Would Be During 'Chelsea Flower Show' Week  So There Will Be No Shortage Of Takers At This Price  But It Does Mean That We Will Probably End Up Returning To 'Durrants' In George Street On This Occasion.,,,,,
,137,No Thanks,,,,,
,139,Please Add Power Outlets In The Room!,,,,,
,145,Should Offer Good Rates For Repeat Customers For Their Loyalty.,,,,,
,146,Only The Terribly Poor Wi-Fi. Ok 5 Years Ago But Not Remotely Competitive With Global Hotel Offerings. Too Slow For Business Purposes.,,,,,
,148,Bar Staff In Evening Extremely Poor  Lack Of Knowledge On Sunday 10Th February. Not Enough Staff At Breakfast. Can't Keep In Going.,,,,,
,149,Appreciated The Upgrade To A Juniour Suite!,,,,,
,152,Bathroom Point Was The One Poor Note. Otherwise An Enjoyable Stay. I Will Experiment With Your Former Single Rooms Soon I Expect. Basil Street Is A Great Location.,,,,,
,153,I Hope I Can Visit Again Soon!!,,,,,
,157,Loved Rhe Pillows Were Can I Buy Some,,,,,
,160,A Rather Strange Comment But  At Breakfast Both My Husband And I Had A Full English But The Bacon Was Very Salty And The Sausages Strangely Tasteless.  The Rest  However  Was Delicious.,,,,,
,165,We Did Not Dine At The Capital This Time But Discussed The Cuisine With Two Other Guests Over Breakfast Who Had  And While They Thought It Was Good They Were Not Particularly Bowled Over By It. Also  The Menu Seemed Rather Restrictive With Only Veal Being Available As A Meat Choice Which Rather Put Us Off. I Like Fish Very Much But Would Have Preferred A Wider Choice. Also  Two Of The Very Best Meals I Have Ever Had In London Were At The Capital When Eric Chavot Was There As Chef. I Consider Him To Be One Of The Greatest Chefs And It Was Rather Sad That He Moved On. Having Said That  We Went To His New Brasserie A Couple Of Days Ago  Rather Excited To Be Trying His Food Again  And It Rather Pains Me To Admit That It Was Disappointing. I Hope He Hasn't Lost His Touch Or Passion. The Extraordinary Thing About His Food When At The Capital Was That It Was So Delicious  Over And Above Technical Brilliance And Wonderful Display Etc.. It Just Made You Want To Come Back For More.,,,,,
,167,No. Good As Ever Otherwise.,,,,,
,174,Please See Note About Lack Of Breakfast,,,,,
,179,I Feel The Capital Is Living Off Its Past  Staying In 5 Star Hotels Across The Country This Hotel Falls Into A 4 Star Category  Not The 5 It Boasts. More Staff Training Is Required,,,,,
,180,An Oasis In The Desert Of Knightsbridge Great Job Kate Chrisitian And Team!!!,,,,,
,181,#Name?,,,,,
,182,Looking Forward To Our Next Stay!  We Hope To Become 'Regulars'!,,,,,
,189,Could You Please Correct The Spelling Of My Surname In Your Records  As Both My Arrival Letter And Later Correspondence Have Been Mis-Spelt.,,,,,
,190,Confusion About Pre-Authorisation Of Credit Cards. The Way In Which This Was Discussed In The Public Foyer On Three Occasions  Twice By Members Of Managerial Team.,,,,,
,192,We Chose To Stay At The Capital Hotel As My Brother Worked There Many Years Ago And It Was Ideally Located For Us To Attend A Concert At The Royal Albert Hall. What We Had Hoped Would Be A Relaxing Weekend Was Ruined By Builders Starting Work At 8.00 Am On Both Mornings. Although We Appreciate This Was Outside Your Control  You Would Almost Certainly Have Known That There Could Be A Potential Problem And Surely Should Have Allocated Rooms Away From The Noise.The Difference Between Happy Customers/Unhappy Customers! ,,,,,
,194,No Idea How You Will Stay In Business,,,,,
,199,The Room Attendents Used A Room Freshening Spray At Evening Turn Down The Aroma Of Which Was So Overpowering That It Induced A Sneezing Fit And I Had To Open The Windows And Leave The Room Until It Has Dissapated. The Toilet Flush Ran Continually And The Glass Shelves In The Bathroom Were Harmfully Lose.,,,,,
,200,Many Thanks Mark & Caroline Horncastle Yorkshire,,,,,
,202,No All Very Good,,,,,
,205,I Always Have A Wonderful Stay At The Capital. Your Team Is First Class.,,,,,
,206,Can't Wait Until Our Ext Visit...,,,,,
,209,We Were Very Happy With Our Stay,,,,,
,212,We Thought The Coffee Which Was Served At Breakfast Was Very Good And Exceeded Our Expectations. Coffee In Some Hotels Can Be Disappointing At Breakfast And This Certainly Was Not The Case. Much Appreciated!,,,,,
,217,When I Stayed At The Capital Years Ago I Always Avoided The Bar Because There Was Not Atmosphere  I.E  No Music. That Has Been Corrected And Now I Enjoy Going To The Bar For A Drink Or A Meeting. The Restaurant At Breakfast On My Last Two Trips Was Painfully Silent. You Can Hear The People At The Next Table Next To You Chewing Their Food. I Strongly Recommend Some Soft Background Music In The Restaurant.,,,,,
,218,Taking A Shower In A Quite Narrow Bath Is Not Easy - Why Not Replace Them With (Rain)Showers Is Always A Big Plus  At Arrival A Refreshing Complementary Drink Is Always Appreciated  At Arrival Some Little Fruit Basket In The Room Is Also Verry Positive And Not So Expensive,,,,,
,219,Perfect Location And I Love The Smaller Boutique Size,,,,,
,220,It Was All Very Easy. I Very Rarely Come Away From A Hotel Without Having Moved Room At Least Once. The Room Was Great. The Staff Very Personable And Attentive In The Main And The Food Good Too.,,,,,
,221,Stayed During A Very Hot Week And The Air Conditioning Understandably Struggled But I Wondered Whether The Heated Towel Racks Could Have Been Turned Off To Help The Overall Temperature - The Hallways Were Very Warm,,,,,
,224,If Possible There Is A Ring Terrace On The Left Of The Entrance Where You Have Placed Couple Of Plans To Replace By Couple Of Chairs And Coffee Table For Smokers ( I Know We Smokers Are Bad And Demanding But We Never Violate The Smoking Law) Appreciated.,,,,,
,227,Would Like To Try The Levin Next Time As This Was Our Original Destination,,,,,
,230,No - We Enjoyed Our Stay,,,,,
,232,We Will Return To Stay At The Capital But L Do Not Think We Would Dine In Outlaws Again,,,,,
,236,Keep It Up.,,,,,
,238,Wonderful Stay. Complementary Champagne For My Birthday - Perfect.,,,,,
,240,Looking Forward To Next Time!,,,,,
,243,I Like Boutique And Personal Service Hotels Like Yours But Disappointed How Such A Grand Lady Has Been Left For So Long Without The Care Required Especially In Such A Location,,,,,
,244,I Am Very  Very Happy With The Service At The Capital  And That Is Why I Keep Coming Back Whenever I Am In London.  The Location Is Excellent  And The Service Is Five Star.,,,,,
,245,None  Will Be Back Soon,,,,,
,253,Thank You ,,,,,
,255,Why So Old System With Separate Hot And Cold Water.?? Big Minus!!!,,,,,
,257,Please Keep Up The Great Work. Very Good Location As Well.,,,,,
,260,Sometimes Staff Need To Be More Discrete When Having Conversations With Each Other. Especially When Taking About Working Grievances,,,,,
,261,Everything Staff Wise And Service Was Superb. Prawn Cocktail In Bar Was Very Bland And Wet And Quite Disappointing.,,,,,
,262,We Have Stayed At The Capital On And Off For Many Years. I Think That The Level Of Service Has Become Better Than Ever. We Have Decided To Hopefully Always Make The Capital Our Hotel Of Choice In London. We Enjoy The Level Of Good Old British Hospitality.,,,,,
,263,The Internet Did Not Work And When You Are For Business You Need It!!!!!,,,,,
,265,The Single Rooms Really Are Too Small To Work In Effectively And Have Insufficient Storage Space For A Week Long Stay.  I Accept That This Was My Choice On Booking And Will Choose Differently In The Future. Even The Barman Delivering Room Service Felt Awkward That There Is Nowhere At All Other Than On The Bed To Place The Tray.,,,,,
,266,We Thoroughly Enjoy Our Stays At The Capital  We Always Feel At Home And Love That It Is Family Run  Not A Huge Corporate Chain.  We Are Also Regular Visitors To The Capital Bar And Outlaw's Restaurant When We Are Just Visiting London For The Day.,,,,,
,270,Sie Sollten Ihr E Homepage Dahingehend Ã¼berarbeiten  Daã Sie Nicht Teuerer Sind Als Internetplattformen  Die Zimmer In Ihrenm Hotel Anbieten! AuãErde3m Wã¤Re Es Sicher Nicht Schlecht  Kurzfristig Freie Zimmer Zu Gã¼nstigeren Preisen Anzubieten. Fã¼r Eine Einzelã¼bernachtung (Ein Kleines Einzelzimmer) Sind Die Preise Zu Hoch!!!! Fã¼r Treue  Immer Wiederkehrende Gã¤Ste Sollten Sie Ã¼ber Bessere Konditionen Nachdenken  Eine Art Treuerabatt'!,,,,,
,271,Enjoyed Our Stay Immensely,,,,,
,272,Just Remembered  We Missed The Small Cloth Napkins In The Bar  Did Not Like The Black Paper Ones.  Merry Christmas Doug,,,,,
,273,No,,,,,
,275,Next Time I Shall Endeavour To Spend More Time In The Hotel - This Visit Was All About Catching Up With Distant Family And We Spent Very Little Time In The Hotel Which Was A Pity.,,,,,
,276,Will Be Staying Again.,,,,,
,278,We Hope To Return Soon.,,,,,
,288,I Did Point Out To The Duty Manager An Email Response I Received When I Originally Booked The Restaurant. I Signed Off With Mrs Gill Faldo And The Response Was 'Hi Gill' Which I Felt Was Very Informal And Inappropriate As I Don't Know This Member Of Staff. Although I Felt It Was A Bit Familiar  Another Guest May Be More Upset By That Informal Approach Than Me.,,,,,
,290,The Bar Feels A Bit Tight But I Realise Space Is Limited.,,,,,
,291,We Enjoyed Our Stay And Will Return .,,,,,
,292,The Silicon Around The Bath In Our Room Needs Replacing !!!!,,,,,
,293,Yes:   Please Bear In Mind That Not Everyone Who Stays At The Capital Finds It Discreet Or Appropriate To Receive Communications Afterwards (Post Or Email) That  They Would Not Wish Their Spouse/Partner To Have Access To.  This Email Has Caused Considerable Embarrassment To Me.,,,,,
,294,When We Return In May  I Hope The Roadworks Are Complete- It Took 20 Minutes To Drive From The Hotel To Sloane Street.,,,,,
,299,Over Many Years We Have Stayed At Small Luxery Hotels Around The World And They Have Always Come Up To Expectation. Locatio Of This Hotel Is Ideal And Certainly Will Remain On My List For Future Visits. Garage Space Is Usually Required And As Always In London Garage Costs Are A Frustration. Perhaps That Cost Could Be Ameliorated Based Upon How Long One Stays?,,,,,
,300,The Manager Of The Capital Is Very Kind And Professional,,,,,
,302,A Small Luxury Hotel With High Service Standards. Well Done,,,,,
,304,We Found The Staff At Breakfast On 22Nd February Unhelpful - The Following Mornings Were Better. It Was Disappointing That Our Car Was Covered In Thick Dust When We Came To Leave. The Staff Did Their Best To Give It A Clean But It Was Very Unsatisfactory.,,,,,
,310,We Enjoyed Our Stay Very Much.,,,,,
,314,Always A Pleasure,,,,,
,316,No  We Were More Than Satisfied. Thank You!,,,,,
,318,Adaptor For Mobile Phone Did Not Work Well / Slow,,,,,
,319,Hope To Return,,,,,
,320,Maybe Add The Accessory To Clean The Toilet. I Didn't Find It In My Room.,,,,,
,326,I'll Be Back!,,,,,
,327,I Will Be Back!,,,,,
,329,The Only Other Comment Is That Your Staff Need To Be Told Not To Enter Rooms Without Knocking.  Within An Hour Of Checking Into Our Room  And When We Were Trying To Have A Rest After Our Flight   Three Different Employees Entered Or Tried To Enter Our Room While We Were In It.,,,,,
,330,Se Comments Earlier,,,,,
,333,See You Soon,,,,,
,336,My Comments Are To Help Improve What Otherwise Has Been A Tremendous Experience  Yet Again!,,,,,
,337,No  Thanks,,,,,
,339,It Was All Excellent,,,,,
,342,The Hotel's Location Is Perfect For My Needs And Its Size Offers Me Comfort And Friendliness Which The Larger  Corporate Hotels Lack.,,,,,
,343,No  We Often Consider Buying Another Appartment In London But Why Bother When We Can Stay At The Capital.,,,,,
,347,We Think You Are Doing An Excellent Job. It Is Always A Pleasure To Come Back.,,,,,
,350,In Our Apartment 305 The Couch Is A Little Old  And Loosing Its Spring.,,,,,
,351,See You Again  Soon I Hope !,,,,,
,352,I Preferred The Breakfast Room  Ie Outlaws When There Was More Of An Atmosphere  It's Neither One Thing Or The Other Now  It Felt Like A Cafeteria ( Albeit A Smart Cafeteria ) Instead Of Luxury Hotel Breakfast Room.,,,,,
,355,Your Service Is The Best In London!,,,,,
,362,We Stayed In Apartment 502 We Found It Very Depressing  It Had Absolutely No Personally  One Would Struggle To Spend Any Time In It.,,,,,
,367,No - We Did Enjoy The Hotel And Would Stay There Again If We Wanted To Be In That Part Of London.   For Leisure Travel  We Liked That Area.  However  My Office Is In The City  So For Business I Would Likely Stay In That Area.,,,,,
,371,I Was Again Disappointed That Our Wines Are Never Given A Feature After 20 Years Of My Company's Support.,,,,,
,372,I Had A Wonderful Time And Will Definitely Stay With You Again When Next In London.,,,,,
,373,We Will Certainly Eat In The Restaurant Again,,,,,
,375,Breakfast Service Staff Seem Very Disorganised,,,,,
,377,We Had A Marvellous Stay And Would Be Very Happy To Return And Hope That Our Plans In Future Allow Us To Do So.,,,,,
,379,Everything Else Amazing Especially The Whisky Tasting,,,,,
,387,Cocktails Were Superb And The Cocktail Waiter Really Knew His Business.,,,,,
,388,Hope To See You Again.,,,,,
,390,You Really Made A Week With My Elderly Mother Very Enjoyable For Both Of Us.,,,,,
,393,A Couple Of Suggestions. A Coffee Maker  Say A Nespresso  For Example  In The Room Would Be Very Welcome. The Water Pressure In The Shower ( We Were In Room 238 ) Is Woefully Inadequate  And Needs Attention.,,,,,
,394,Your Concierge Staff Are Also Very Helpful And Great Fun - Another Asset.,,,,,
,397,Enjoyed Our Stay Very Much. Lovely Hotel,,,,,
,398,No,,,,,
,400,Please Improve Internet,,,,,
,407,We Enjoy The Atmosphere Of The Capital - Which Is Why We Return.,,,,,
,408,I Always Look Forward To My Next Visit At The Capital.,,,,,
,413,I Look Forward To A Return Visit.,,,,,
,419,We Spilt Some Hot Chocolate Drink On The Carpet And Thought We'd Done A Reasonable Job In Cleaning It Up And We Should Probably Have Mentioned It On Leaving But Didn't. However On Our Drive Home We Had A Call That My Wife Took As I Was Driving And She Was Surprised To Get A Telling Off From A Member Of Your Staff. I Took A Call The Following Day And The Same Member Of Staff Who Started To Repeat The Telling Off To Me Anyway She Concluded By Saying We Wouldn't Be Charged For Cleaning The Carpet Or Curtains. I'm Afraid It Sort Of Put A Damper On What Was Yet Another Excellant Stay With You  If One Of My (Non Paying) House Guests Spilt Something On My Home Carpet I Certainly Wouldn't Be Asking Them To Pay If Required I'd Claim On My House Insurance.,,,,,
,420,Thank You For Your Many Kindnesses. It Was A Truly Wonderful Oasis For Both Of Us.,,,,,
,421,See You Soon,,,,,
,422,All Good. Thank You,,,,,
,425,None,,,,,
,426,I Think The Space For Eating Breakfast May Be Cramped. The Black Pudding Has Been Over Cooked On My Last Two Stays.,,,,,
,433,From The Foregoing We Think You Know Our Feelings So No Further Comments Are Necessary.,,,,,
,434,You Have A Nice Hotel  Nice Staff And A Good Ambience Which Is Why I Have Been Coming To Stay For Such A Long Time - But Do Not Remodel Any More Rooms  Please!,,,,,
,438,See Above,,,,,
,444,Just A Few Things Not Quite Right Turned What I Thought Was Going To Be An Exceptionally Pleasant Experience Into A Rather Less Enjoyable One And I Really Thought You Had Let Yourselves Down. I Was Sorry That This Was So  For So Many Other Things About Your Famous Hotel Are More Than Acceptable...And Of Course I Did Want My Wife To Have A Perfect Time. Sorry To Be A Bit Negative  But You Wanted A Candid Response ....,,,,,
,446,No,,,,,
,447,Be More Up To Date With Information,,,,,
,451,Will Return And Will Keep Recommending The Capital.,,,,,
,452,After 2 Weeks In India  With An Uneven Lodging Experience  Our Final Night 'On The Road' Before Flying Home Was The Best On The Trip. Thanks To All.,,,,,
,455,Very Pleasent Stay In London,,,,,
,458,-,,,,,
,460,The Rooms Are Small And Very Bland.,,,,,
,461,It Was A Pleasure To Spend Time At Your Hotel And Meet Many Of Your Management And Staff.,,,,,
,463,Our Second Home.,,,,,
,465,Not Really,,,,,
,466,The Quality Of The Cooked Breakfast Has Deteriorated Since Our Last Visit The Sasuage And Toast Being Of A Particualrly Inferior,,,,,
,467,We'll Be Back!,,,,,
,475,To Come Again Would Need.Better Room,,,,,
,479,One Last Thing  I Checked My Bill Before Going Out For The Morning  I Was Paying For My Mother As A Treat For Her 90Th Birthday As Part Of A Trip To The Chelsea Flower Show  I Asked That The Two Bills Be Charged To Me  This Was No Problem And I Was Told That It Would Be Dealt With While I Was Out  On Returning To The Hotel I Asked For The Revised Bill And Was Told It Ha Been Put In My Case  However On Returning Home I Couldn't Find It  What Had Happened Was It Had Been Put In My Mother Case  She Had In The Meantime Thought It Was Something For Her And Opened It  She Was Horrified At The Cost And Somewhat Embarrassed  It Slightly Spoiled The Treat.,,,,,
,496,Not Really As We Have Stayed With You Over 25 Years And Can Always Get A Deal As Every One Knows Us And Our Normal Requests.,,,,,
,499,As We Left  I Told My Husband I Would Definitely Stay With You If And/Or When We Return To London.,,,,,
,503,We Loved The Fact That Every Night There Was A Bottle Of Wã¡Ter On The Night Stand. And Wã¡Ter In The Lobby.,,,,,
,506,No,,,,,
,508,We Will Be Back Next Year.  I Want Room 264 Again.,,,,,
,512,No Thanks  Everything Was Just Fine.,,,,,
,514,My Wife Is Now Addicted To The Cherries.,,,,,
,516,We Will Be Back Next Year,,,,,
,517,My Only Comment Is That The Rooms And Hallways Are Heavily Perfumed And  As I Suffer Allergies  My Eyes Became Bloodshot.  I Didn't Have This Problem At Any Other Hotel On My Trip So I Presume That The Perfume (Or Room Freshener) Was The Problem.,,,,,
,519,My Wife And I Enjoyed The Courtesy And Hospitality By All Of The Staff,,,,,
,523,Thank You!,,,,,
,526,I Was Very Pleased To Finally Meet David Levin(And His Wife)To Have A Friendly Chat Regarding Mutual Interests,,,,,
,527,We Had A Spontaneous Conversation With Mr Levin About Our Experience At The Hands Of The French While We Waited For A Cab At The Front Steps.  He Volunteered That Doing Business In France Was Impossible And We All Laughed.  (We Did Not Formally Meet Mr Levin.  It Was Just A Casual Conversation.  However It Did Give Us Encouragement.)  Liliana Later Explained The Pre-Payment System Very Patiently And In Fact Her Comments Helped Us To Forgive The French Methods A Little Because The System Worked Perfectly Well For Us At The Capital.,,,,,
,531,Very Grateful For An Upgrade To A Junior Suite Free Of Charge Which Is The First Time It Has Happened To Us.,,,,,
,536,We Appreciated Staying At A Smaller Sized Hotel,,,,,
,540,Your Bathrooms Are Way  Way  Below The Standard That Is Expected At An Hotel Of Your Class. This Is Something You Would Expect At A Cheap B & B!!!!!,,,,,
,541,The Apartment Was A Perfect Base For My Week Of Catching Up With Friends  Renewing My Acquaintance With The City And Also Doing A Small Amount Of Business.,,,,,
,544,I Expected To Love Staying In A Flat  But I Didn't. The Slow  Creaky Lift  Stark Decor  Lack Of A Desk  Lack Of Heated Towel Rail  And Cramped Bathroom Made Me Wish We Were Staying In The Hotel Instead.,,,,,
,579,My Room Had Been Upgraded And Was Very Nice  So I Felt The Stay Was Good Value For London.,,,,,
,581,Conor  Paid The Bill.,,,,,
,626,Our Second Home!,,,,,
,630,See Page 21 Of Survey - We Will Be Arriving On 19 May  2013,,,,,
,644,Excellent Location. Breakfast Was Good. The Room Fell Short For Me.,,,,,
,650,Competitive Rates And Seasonal Offers Are An Attraction In Booking To Stay At The Capital.,,,,,
,668,Really Enjoyable Meal And Stay,,,,,
,676,Thanks To All. Well Done.,,,,,
,683,I'll Be There Next Year!,,,,,
,689,Very Central And Easy For Shopping. Concierge Looked After Our Bags And Shopping Until Our Departure Having Checked Out Earlier.,,,,,
,714,No,,,,,
,760,Your Survey Is Way Too Long !!!!!!!,,,,,
,765,I Love Staying At The Capital But I Feel It's Losing It's Chic Edge ,,,,,
,766,Please Change The Bathrooms And Change The Plumbing System.,,,,,
,775,N/A,,,,,
,776,The Staff Were Very Polite And I Felt It Was So Nice Experiance To Stay Yours.,,,,,
,778,A Certain Disagreement On The Final Account (Invoice) That So Far Has Not Been Sorted Out,,,,,
,783,It Was Surprising  And Perhaps A Little Disappointing  That No Reference To The Heating Difficulties And Temperature Were Made At The Time Of Departure  And No Suggestion Of Making A Small Deduction From The Bill For The Discomfort At Dinner And Breakfast. This Might Be A Factor To Take Into Account When Considering The Next Stay In London !,,,,,
,789,I Would Have Liked A Little Bigger Bathroom With Seperate Shower,,,,,
,794,Room 223 Smells A Bit Old And Musty Did Not Check What Is Was Carpet?Towels Do Not Smell Really Fresh Either I Know Because I Used One As A Pillow [Because I Prefer Thinner Pillows Than Hotels Supply],,,,,
,798,Restaurant Is Rather Hot Next To Radiators ,,,,,
,803,Re: 15  Above  I Always Have High Expectations For The Capital Which Have Always Been Fully Met.  Accordingly  Meting Expectations Is The Highest "Grade" I Can Give.,,,,,
,804,Re: Question 15  Based On Past Experiences  I Have Very High Expectations For The Capital Hotel.  Consequently "Meting" Those Expectations Is The Best The Hotel Can Do. ,,,,,
,805,The Eggs At Breakfast Were The Best That I Have Ever Had!,,,,,
,807,Overall Very Good.,,,,,
,809,The Staff Are Your Best Asset. I Have Stayed In Many Hoteles Around The World And Yours Is My Favourite. Over The Years I Have Stayed In Many Of Your Finer Rooms And Very Much Enjoyed Them.
Happy Christmas To All At The Capitol
Rupert F Maude,,,,,
,814,No,,,,,
,818,Excellent Hotel And Service Would Recommend To My Friends.,,,,,
,820,Thank Goodness For A Room In Which Every Switch Etc Is Not Controlled By Computer. I Loved The Slightly Low Tec Approach.,,,,,
,821,Could Be Better.,,,,,
,822,We Cannot Wait To Come Back,,,,,
,840,We Will Be Dining At Outlaws Again But We Will Be Finding Alterntive Accommodation.,,,,,
,842,We Like The Capital. I Hate Large Impersonal Hotels Which Is Why We Chose The Capital. The Restaurant And Bar Food Are Exceptional. Everything Apart From The Noisy Room Was Exceptional. ,,,,,
