,8,First Class!!,,,,,
,13,Fabulous Setting; Beautiful  Impressive Building; Lovely Room With Great Bed; Wonderful Hall With Wood Fire Creating Heartwarming Smell Of Wood Smoke As Soon As You Enter The Front Door.  Excellent Service In Every Respect From Friendly And Helpful Staff -Formal But Not Stuffy.,,,,,
,127,1St Class For Families With Bouncy Labrador!,,,,,
,130,Relaxing And Quiet - Just What Was Needed. Thank You,,,,,
,134,Wonderful With Only One Disappointment. There Were No Magazines Except Free Local Copies. I Have Been Staying At Bovey Castle For Almost Thirty Years Now And It Is The First Time I Have Visited When The Magazines Were Not Available .  As I Visit On My Own  I Look Forward To Sitting In Front Of The Fire In Either The Cathedral Room  Drawing Room Or Library With A Cup Of Tea And A Magazine To Keep Me Company.  The Lack Of Them On My Last Stay Gave The Impression That Corners Were Being Cut To Save Money.  This May Not Be True  But Nevertheless The 5 Star Experience Was Tarnished.  The Spa However And The Swimming Pool Were Fabulous And Certainly Deserve The 5 Star Rating .  The Staff And Service Were Excellent And I Will Be Back   But I Will Remember To Bring My Own Reading Material. However  I Am Interested To Know The Logic Behind The Decision Not To Supply Magazines Any More. It Seems Like Shooting Yourself In The Foot  And Undoes All The Goodwill You Have Spent So Long Building Up.    ,,,,,
,203,Very Relaxing  An Unexpectedly Informal Atmosphere. Staff Attentive And Polite. Food Was Perfect. A Delightful 3 Night Stay.,,,,,
,211,A Wonderful Experience  Helpful Staff  Fabulous Activities  Delicious Food  Comfortable Bedroom.,,,,,
,250,Did Not Want To Leave! Better Than Chewton Glen!,,,,,
,264,An Amazing Place.  Excellent 2 Day Stay.  Attentive But Not Over The Top Service.,,,,,
,269,Relaxed Atmosphere  Polite Staff And In The Main Friendly  (Reception And Welcoming Staff Especially). Breakfast Good  Bistro Not Consistent (2 Out Of 3 Evening Meals Good). Fabulous Views From Room (14) Looking Out At Your Lovely Grounds.,,,,,
,289,Relaxing And Comfortable In Beautiful Surroundings.   Thoughtful Attention To Detail.   Excellent Service.,,,,,
,305,Nothing Too Much Trouble - Loved Every Minute Of It,,,,,
,317,Love The Lodges And Also The Hotel. Gorgeous Setting.  Staff Helpful And Polite At All Times.  Great Spa Experience  Treatment With Kate So Relaxing !Had A Great Time,,,,,
,356,We Had A Great Time!,,,,,
,366,Very Relaxing And Good For A Half Term Break,,,,,
,381,Very Good  The Staff Were Very Helpful And Attentive  However I Believe They Would Benefit From Some More Training,,,,,
,392,Extremely Good,,,,,
,410,Very Relaxing In Beautiful Surroundings,,,,,
,440,Excellent From Arrival To Departure,,,,,
,462,Top Level Experiance,,,,,
,467,It Wasn't As Great As I Thought It Was Going To Be As Per The Website. The Grounds Were Beautiful But The 'Castle' Itself Was Not Particularly Well Maintained  The First Room We Were Shown Was Smaller And Plainer Than Expected And Looked Quite Grubby- Although We Accept It Was Clean  The Teastains Etc On The Cushions Make Me Think It Is Not A Particularly Looked After Hotel. This Was Brought Up With Your Staff And We Were Given Another Room Which We Were Happy With- Thank You. However While Walking Around The Castle  The Benches Were A Bit Disgusting  The Swimming Pool Area Was Obviously Not Being Checked Regularly Based On The Amount Of Towels On The Floor And Covering The Available Loungers By Guests Who Were No Longer Using The Pool Facility  And The Changing Rooms And Showers Were Horrible! On The Other Hand  Breakfast And Dinner Both Days Were Lovely  And Afternoon Tea Was Exceptional. Also We Asked For An Iron And Board One Day And It Took About Half An Hour To Be Brought To The Room Even Though We Offered To Collect It From Reception. We Assumed We'd Been Forgotton About.  ,,,,,
,524,Luxurious  Relaxing  Wonderful.,,,,,
,532,Lovely Setting  Friendly Staff  But The Room And Breakfast Was Overpriced For What It Was. What You Are Really Paying For Is The Overall Experience.,,,,,
,540,The Service Was Great  The Place Is Beautiful And The Food Spectacular (If Some Combinations Such As Grapefruit  Pork And Prawn Were A Step Too Far For Me!). The Only Thing I Noticed Was That It Was Obvious That Some Of The Rooms Hadn't Been Stayed In For A While So For Example It Took A Lot Of Muscle Power To Turn The Shower On Which Was Stuck  And The Milk Was Off (Although In Date).,,,,,
,541,I Had A Lovely Visit To Bovey  The Location  Site And Particularly The Food Was Exquisite,,,,,
,549,Relaxing Stay With My Family. However  The Service Levels Are Incredibly Mixed.  I Found The Staff Generally To Be Helpful And Very Polite  But The Service In The Castle Bistro Restaurant Was Very Poor.  We Had Dinner There One Evening And Received An Awful Service.  We Will Not Be Going Back To The Castle Bistro.,,,,,
,563,Very Relaxing - Service Is Amazing From Staff,,,,,
,623,The Staff Were Friendly And Helpful But On Several Occasions There Was A Disconnect Between What Was Asked For (I.E. Items To Be Placed On Separate Bils) And What Actually Happened (I.E. The Items Were Not Put On The Correct Bills).,,,,,
,631,Very Welcoming  Relaxing  Very Dog Friendly And Beautiful Setting,,,,,
,637,A Wonderful Place To Relax. We Only Had One Night But  With Dinner And A Spa Treatment  We Felt Very Refreshed!,,,,,
,640,Very Nice - Just A Shame To Be There For Work!,,,,,
,647,Amazing  Staff  Location  Lodge And Activities.,,,,,
,648,Impressive Setting /  Room Was Good / Staff Were Very Friendly And Accommodating Apart Form The Breakfast Team Who Must Try Harder.,,,,,
,657,We Had A Very Relaxing Time And Staff Were Very Helpful.  The Only Negative Was That Our Room Was Supposed To Be Ready At 3Pm But Wasn't Ready Until 3.40.,,,,,
,722,We Had A Very Relaxed And Relaxing Break. We Enjoyed The Area And The Castle  It Felt Like A Perfect Hideaway.,,,,,
,773,Very Pleasant Lodge. A Lot Of Stains On The Carpets And Sofas And Peeling Wallpaper Which Was Rather Off Putting But The Bedlinen And Towels All Seemed Very Clean. Very Helpful And Pleasant Staff  Peaceful Location. Activities List On The Door Each Day Was Also Very Useful. A Very Nice Location To Spend A Week!,,,,,
,820,Lovely Grounds - Good Activities - Very Nice Lodge,,,,,
,829,Lovely Hotel And Location. Just Felt Bistro Was Poor And Edwardian Grill Over Priced.,,,,,
,836,Hotel Very Impressive. Staff Very Helpful.,,,,,
,888,Very Relaxing With Myriad Activities  Community Rooms  And Good Food.,,,,,
,989,Some Staff Not Friendly   Apart From That A Beautiful Place.,,,,,
,997,I Would Like To Thank Federico And The Team For A Truly Wonderful Week End. The Room  Food And Service Were First Class Will Come Back Again.  ,,,,,
,998,A Luxurious Country Get-Away In The Most Idyllic Setting.,,,,,
,1013,Thoroughly Enjoyed The Two Day Experience For Our Wedding Anniversary And Was Very Impressed With Quality Of People Led By A Most Enthusiatice General Manager. Thanks You,,,,,
,1018,Relaxing  Comfortable Environment With Good And Friendly Service.  Spa Treatment Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1021,Lovely Staff Overall.  Found The Edwardian Restaurant Service In The Evening  (Head Of Front Of House ) Not A Comfortable And Relaxing Approach Personally.   Was A Little Disappointed With Regard To The Service Charge.  Spa Lovely  Pool Wonderful And Liked The Bistro Very Much.  Would Recommend Binoculars Available For Guests (Although Realise These Are Large Ticket Items That Might Disappear).  It Is A Beautiful Hotel  Lovely Comfortable Beds  Grounds And Ambience.   Our Bill Was Incorrect But It Was Graciously Corrected Great Reception Staff.,,,,,
,1032,Excellent Service. Disappointing Food In Grill But Good In Bistro.,,,,,
,1033,Relaxing Weekend In Attractive And Welcoming Surroundings. All Of The Staff Were Welcoming And Professional  All Of The Other Guests Were Friendly.,,,,,
,1037,Very Good With Just A Few Minor Problems At The Lodge (C1),,,,,
,1047,Wonderful Relaxing Break,,,,,
,1066,Fantastic Setting  Facilities  Food And Staff,,,,,
,1089,A Very Enjoyable Week Despite The Weather,,,,,
,1105,It Was Just A Brief Stay Of Less Than 24 Hours But Was Most Enjoyable Despite The Appalling Weather!,,,,,
,1109,It Provides A Great Base For Exploring Dartmoor.  Greatly Improved In Recent Months,,,,,
,1114,The Staff Are Excellent - Just The Right Amount Of Enthusiasm To Make You Feel Welcome But Not Uncomfortable.,,,,,
,1125,Very Pleasant  But Service Was Not Very Good.   The Golf Course Appeared To Lack Maintenance,,,,,
,1139,Elegant  Comfortable 5* See My Trip Advisor Report ( Physio Val!).,,,,,
,1156,Absolutely Lovely.,,,,,
,1167,For An Expensive Hotel It Was Very Relaxed And Not Stuffy  Sensible Dress Code Etc.  A Good Country House Hotel Experience,,,,,
,1202,It Was As Good As We Remembered It Being 7 Years Ago.  We Had Spent Our Honeymoon At Bovey Castle And This Was Our 7Th Wedding Anniversary.  It Will Always Be Special To Us.,,,,,
,1232,Perfect!,,,,,
,1262,Fantastic!,,,,,
,1272,Bovey Castle Isn't Just A Hotel  It's An Experience - I Couldn't Fault The Service  From The Reception On Arrival To The Help As We Left. (I Managed To Drop Our Car Keys Into A Drain And The Staff Went Above And Beyond In Helping To Retrieve Them!) The Food Was Out Of This World (Edwardian Grill)  The Decor Was Gorgeous And The Log Fires And Spa Treatments Were An Extra Fabulous Treat.,,,,,
,1309,Wonderful - Luxurious And Comfortable  Friendly And Helpful Staff  Stunning Views. Everything I Want From A Hotel,,,,,
,1341,Excellent. A Thoroughly Relaxing Experience.,,,,,
,1377,We Had A Fab Time  The Whole Experience Was Great And Very Relaxing.  The Food Was Superb  The Staff Were Excellent - Especially The Cheese Board Waiter! The Falconry Display Was Interesting  As Was The Owl Delivery In The Ring To The Bride! We Will Definitely Return.  Thanks,,,,,
,1378,A Very Relaxing Break,,,,,
,1393,Haven Of Tranquility  Attentive Service  Thoroughly Recommendable.  The Reduced Price We Paid We Considered Good Value For Money - The Full Prices Quoted Are Expensive.,,,,,
,1447,Very Pleasant Surroundings And Comfortable Accommodation. However  The Food Was Not Quite To The Same Standard.,,,,,
,1539,We Love Having A Lodge For A Week With The Dogs But Being Able To Enjoy The Lovely Bar  Pool And Eating Facilities At The Hotel. We Find The Main Rooms Comfortable And Relaxing To Sit In For Drinks And Afternoon Tea.,,,,,
,1549,Friendly  Courteous  Efficient And Memorable.,,,,,
,1570,We Loved The Hotel And The Grounds  The Food  The Relaxed Friendly Ambience And Found Our Room Very Comfortable. Service Was Very Good Most Of The Time Though A Little Lacking On One Or Two Occasions But Was Easily Remedied So Not A Major Issue At All.,,,,,
,1581,Bovey Castle Is An Exquisite Jewel Set In Stunning Countryside - With A Treasure Around Every Corner...,,,,,
,1585,Outstanding  Dont Know How It Could Have Been Better,,,,,
,1586,Another Wonderful Time. Booking Easy And Helpful. Arrival Seamless. Liked The Day Before Call To See If We Wanted To Book Anything Else To Get More Out Of Stay. Golf Dept Great. Arrival For Drinks And Dinner Lovely Touch. Cocktails Sublime  Food And Wine Wondeful. Service Attentive Without Being Overpowering. Room Fabulous. Loved The Soft Robes. Sound System Very Good. Everything Was Very Very Good And Made  A Short Stay Feel Much Longer.,,,,,
,1603,Excellent,,,,,
,1614,Relaxed Hotel With The Finest Quality Of Service  Location And Experience,,,,,
,1628,Luxurious And Comfortable Accommodation With Excellent  Friendly Customer Service. Beautiful Grounds And Good Facilities. Being Dog Friendly Was A Bonus Too.,,,,,
,1653,Thoroughly Enjoyable,,,,,
,1678,Extremely Enjoyable Stay As Always. Didnt Realise We Had Booked During The Childrens School Half Term But In General The Children Behaved Themselves Very Well. Seem To Have A Large Turnover In Staff Since My Last Visit But Everyone Was So Polite.,,,,,
,1753,Extremely Good Service   Splendid Setting  Very Nice Room.,,,,,
,1784,Gracious & Unintimidating Service - Something You Don't Always Receive In Hotels Of Bovey's Calibre.,,,,,
,1801,Expensive !  However  Having Said That  It Was Very Good To See It Restored To Its Previous Glory.  We First Stayed There 40 Years Ago  And Were Very Pleased To See The Lounge With The Minstrels Gallery Back As It Used To Be.,,,,,
,1809,The Best Friday Night We Have Had For A Long Time. The Staff Were So Professional And Ensured Our Stay Was The Best It Could Be.,,,,,
,1868,We Both Feel That You And Your Staff Go That Extra Mile - Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Us And Our Dog.,,,,,
,1871,Very Good,,,,,
,1891,Made To Feel Very Welcome Throughout Our Stay  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. All Staff And Service Was Excellent   Especially In Edwardian  Restaurant . Would Definitely Come Again And Recommend To Others,,,,,
,1917,Great From The Start. Reception Was Excellent Booking The Hotel Wad Painless Spa Was Fantastic,,,,,
,1919,Had A Lovely Relaxing Weekend And Felt Thoroughly Spoilt. The Only Area That Was Not Up To My Expectation Was The Castle Bistro  Customer Service Was Not Up To A 5 Star Hotel And Food Was Overpriced For The Quality Received.,,,,,
,1927,Lovely  Relaxing & Idyllic,,,,,
,1987,Lovely Stay In A Beautiful Setting,,,,,
,1989,Outstanding. We Were Made To Feel Relaxed And Welcoming  Which Is Generally Quite Hard To Achieve In Such A 5 Star Hotel. I Liked The Fact The Hotel Allowed Dogs And Children So It Made The Hotel Feel Alive And Not Some Old Peoples Home As Some Places Can Be.,,,,,
,1994,Fabulous  As Usual!,,,,,
,2014,Excellent Customer Service  Rooms Very Comfortable  Surroundings Excellent  Food Not Up To Standard,,,,,
,2048,Apart From The Weather It Was Lovely! The Staff Are Exceptional  A Real Credit To You.,,,,,
,2056,It Was My Husband's Birthday  I Mentioned It To Federico  He Decorated The Table  Supplied A Bottle Of Champagne For Us  And Had A Cake Made  To Top That In The Evening He Bought Us A Cocktail  What A Lovely Thought  And Such A Nice Touch  He Was Very Busy That Day With A Wedding Aswell  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble!!!!,,,,,
,2087,Excellent  Staff Were Really Helpful  Rooms Lovely And Food Excellent,,,,,
,2100,Very Good Excellent Customer Service,,,,,
,2105,Very Pleasant Experiance,,,,,
,2121,Another Excellent Stay  Although Disappointed Not To Be At Rear Of Hotel  Not To Have A Fridge In The Room  To Not Have Eggs From Chickens As Per Previous Stays,,,,,
,2126,Relaxing,,,,,
,2138,Outstanding,,,,,
,2172,Wonderful.,,,,,
,2177,Lovely Luxurious Yet Comfortable Hotel,,,,,
,2187,Overhaul Very Nice   But We Had A Room Next To The Lift (A Bit Noisy) And I Had Steak On One Evening And Had To Send It Back.,,,,,
,2188,Great Location/ Good Staff/Fine Dining It Isn't / Definitely Overpriced.,,,,,
,2197,Although Only A Short Stay Really Enjoyed It  Especially The Complimentary Drink At Breakfast For Our Anniversary!!  Thank You Much Appreciated!,,,,,
,2201,Loved Every Minute! Such Gorgeous Buildings And Surrounding Countryside.,,,,,
,2217,Wonderful Relaxing Stay   Sometimes Service Was A Little Slow But Generally Very Good.  Just A Small Point 2 Days Running The Small Bottle Of Milk In Our Bedroom Fridge Was Off.  We've Already Booked To Come Back Later This Year Though As We Enjoyed Our Stay So Much.,,,,,
,2229,Very Luxurious Even Though Our Bedroom Was Very Basic.....Bathroom Was Fine......Very Relaxing!,,,,,
,2233,A Very Relaxing Stay With The Finest Dining In An Exquisite Hotel Set In Beautiful Grounds.,,,,,
,2242,Excellent Location  Reasonable Room Although It Was Noisy Due To The Extractor Fan System  Food Not As Good As It Should Have Been.,,,,,
,2282,Fantastic. Everything Was Great. All Staff Attentive  Kind And Welcoming And Are A Credit To The Hotel.,,,,,
,2304,Great,,,,,
,2340,Loved Every Minute,,,,,
,2364,Relaxed And Pampered!,,,,,
,2399,Got Lots Of Attention  But Thats Probably Because We Stayed During The Week Rather Than Weekend,,,,,
,2404,It Was Such A Relaxing Stay  The Staff Were Attentive  Approachable And Always Ready To Help. The Lounges Were So Comfortable And Peaceful  The Atmosphere Was Homely.  Our Room Was Comfortable  And Spacious With Lovely Views.... Our Upgrade Was Very Much Appreciated  Thank You! The Food In The Bistro And The Edwardian Grill Was Superbly Cooked And Presented.,,,,,
,2405,Relaxing And Enjoyable. Staf Very Good.,,,,,
,2414,Relaxing And Enjoyable.,,,,,
,2485,Amazing Hotel And Facilities  Let Down By Poor Service And Unreasonable (If Minor) Additions To Bill (E.G. Service Charges On Room Rate).,,,,,
,2486,Just Perfect.,,,,,
,2487,Having Worked & Stayed In Other 5* Hotels (Royal Crescent  Bath & Pennyhill Park  Bagshot) I Was Surprised At How Friendly And Welcoming Bovey Castle Was For Us With 2 Young Children. An Excellent Experience.,,,,,
,2492,A Fantastic Venue With The Most Attentive Staff.  All Our Guests Were Well Looked After.,,,,,
,2499,Luxury  It's Such A Wonderful Location And Atmosphere,,,,,
,2501,Not A Real Castle  Staff Poor And Service Charges Forced On Us. Prices Were Very High As It Is.,,,,,
,2556,Lovely Location  Excellent Activities For Kids  Expensive,,,,,
,2558,The Staff Are Lovely And Very Helpful And Friendly.  However The Fabric Of The Building And The Rooms At The Back Leave Much To Be Desired.  It Is A Bit Tired And Needs Refurbishment In Places.,,,,,
,2572,First Class In Every Area.  A Bit Of Old Rural England At Its Finest.,,,,,
,2575,Brilliant Apart From The Dinner Booking Experience,,,,,
,2596,Fabulous,,,,,
,2605,Very Mixed Poor Experience In Bistro-Poor Menu-Average Food-Poor Service Drinks And Wine Are Overpriced Lovely Setting And Building Many Of Staff Not Up To 5 Star Hotel Standard And Uniforms Tatty,,,,,
,2621,Room Only Overlooked Rooftops Very Warm No Biscuits With Coffee Bistro Gave Us The Wrong Meal  I Think This Is Really Only For The Hunting Shooting Fishing Groups  Dining Room Staff Very Pleasant I'm Afraid I Was Really Disappointed  Oh The Coffee Was A Joke Trying To Get It Into Those Cups  I Have Had Three Hotels So Do Understand You Can T Please Everyone But It Could Have Been A Lot Better For The Money.,,,,,
,2638,The Room Was Very Nice But We Were Booked Into The Bistro Which We Found Very Disappointing  Mussels Over Cooked And No Choice When It Came To Desert  Well Sticky Toffee Pudding Or Ice Cream.,,,,,
,2639,We Felt Pampered And Spoilt. At Ease And Made Comfortable For The Whole Duration Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,2648,Lovely Grounds  Great Views From The Front Rooms  Evening Meal Service And Cooking Very Good Though Surprised That Young Children Admitted To Grill Room After 9:30 Pm. Breakfast Less Impressive. Thoroughly Enjoyable Falconry Display. Considerable Redecoration Needed In Guest Rooms Particularly Around The Windows. Guest Services Advice Needs Updating .... Apparently Wi-Fi Is Now Free.,,,,,
,2657,Slow Service  Do Not Agree With Service Charges.,,,,,
,2658,It Was Very Enjoyable And A Wonderful Experience,,,,,
,2665,A Very Special Experience Thank You,,,,,
,2683,As Usual  We Had A Lovely Break - Only Two Things Marred Our Experience This Time - We Should Have Been Warned That The Course Was Actually Closed On Tuesday As We Always Come To Play Golf.  And The Extremely Awful Noise From The Extractor Fan (I Think) In Room 11 Was Reallynot Acceptable.  But The Very Efficient Lady At Reception Organised A Room Move As Soon As I Complained  Which Was Excellant Servic.,,,,,
,2716,We Had A Wonderful Time. We Enjoyed The House  Grounds  And The Service,,,,,
,2722,Parts Of Our Stay Were Lovely But This Was Tempered By Feeling That We Were Taken Advantage Of At Other Times. Ie: Being Charged £17 For A Glass Of Sauvignon Blanc In The Bar  Without First Being Shown The Price List.,,,,,
,2745,We Had A Lovely Stay All The Staff Are Very Efficient And Good,,,,,
,2753,Very Relaxing With Wonderful Facilities Like A Swim Before Breakfast As Breakfast Was Until Late. Lounging In The Fire Lit Areas On Wonderful Sofas. We Had Very Good Food And A Lovely Room,,,,,
,2760,Fantastic Experience All Round,,,,,
,2796,Wonderful Service From Everyone From Beginning To End. Staff Had Correct Balance Of Respectful Yet Friendly Service. Food In The Brasserie Was Below Par Although Service There Was Good And Decor Stunning.  Ambience Was So Relaxing And I Enjoyed The Bird Display.,,,,,
,2799,We Had A Lovely Time. We Were So Very Well Looked After. Did Not Want To Leave!,,,,,
,2823,A Very Relaxing Stay In An Exquisite Hotel Which Has A Professional And Attentive Staff Overseen By An Excellent Manager Who Has Very Good People Skills And Attention To Detail.  The Dining Experience In Both The Bistro And The Main Restaurant Was Exception In Terms Of The Service Provided And Standard Of The Cuisine. A Very Memorable Stay And Will Definitely Experience It Again In The Future.,,,,,
,2845,Not As Special As Expected,,,,,
,2857,Very Pleasant Surroundings And Friendly & Helpful Staff,,,,,
,2901,The Rooms Were Superb  Breakfast And Dinner In Your Main Restaurant Excellent.   It Was A Shame There Was Not A Little Bar Area Where We Could Order Drinks At The Bar  It Was Too Formal Having To Rely On Staff Service Etc.,,,,,
,2930,All Public Areas Are Fantastic  Staff Were Faultless  Dinner Very Good  Cooked Breakfast Ok But Range Of Foods Superb. Loved All The Amenities & Used Them. Tennis Courts (Weather Was Great - Oct!) Bikes  Spa. Didn't Make Use Of Pool Area The Weather Was So Good We Wanted To Be Outside. Swimming Has To Be For The Next Visit. Disappointed With Size Of Bed & Felt That As We Were On An Offer We Were Given A Basic Room & Shown Back Staircase To Use With Threadbare Carpet. That Didn't Bother Us As Much As The Size Of Bed We Really Need A Kingsize To Sleep Now. The Falconry  Eagle Display Was Great & The Guy Was Knowledgeable & Funny. Loved His Dog Boris Too.,,,,,
,2934,The Overall Experience Was Excellent. We Loved The Building And Grounds  Staff Were Relaxed And Welcoming And Our Room (21) Was Comfortable. The Food At Dinner In The Grill And At Breakfast Was Very Good  Service Was Good. We All Enjoyed Ourselves Very Much And Loved The Relaxed Ambience Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,2950,Excellent Facilities  Ever Helpful And Friendly Staff And Beautiful Grounds,,,,,
,3025,A Relaxing  Rejuvenating Break  In Beautiful Surroundings With Attentive  Friendly Staff.,,,,,
,3038,It Was A Fantastic Experience. Loved It.,,,,,
,3702,Magical!,,,,,
,3780,Fantastic,,,,,
,3781,Excellent!,,,,,
,3816,A Fantastic Hotel In A Brilliant Location With Great Food And Friendly Helpful Staff,,,,,
,3863,Luxury In A Friendly And Relaxed Atmoshere,,,,,
,3881,Very Peaceful,,,,,
,3888,Above Average But Nothing Spectacular,,,,,
,3991,Lots Of Reasons To Deserve Its 5* Rating But Service Not Always Great And Our Room No 33 Needed Repairs And So Did Some Communal Hallways And Stair Carpets.,,,,,
,3995,Great  We Thoroughly Enjoyed Ourselves.,,,,,
,4069,Really Good - I Really Appreciated How Hard The Staff Try And Sort Everything Out For A Great Stay. Fed The Manager Was Excellent And Knew My Name!! Remembered My Husband Had Left His Jacket In The Restuarant - Small Details Like This Are So Important  So That Was Fantastic. All The Things Put On For The Children Were Also Really Good.  Overall V Impressed With The Hotel - Very Clean  Tidy  But Had A Lovely Informal Feel. Great Staff Super Friendly Tracy Our Baby Sitter Was Excellent!!!   Found The Additional 5% Charges A Bit Strange - I Would Prefer For All This Just To Be On The Bill From The Start Versus Adding It On .  We Will Definitely Come Back. Food Was Also Lovely.,,,,,
,4135,The Best Hotel We Have Ever Stayed In From Start To Finish Everything Was Fantastic.,,,,,
,4140,Fantastic - After A Slightly Shaky Start! Even Though I'd Called Ahead & Spoken To Reservations About The Fact That It Was A Special Occasion - The Room We Were Allocated Was Over The Extractor Fan (Not Sure Exactly What It Is) - Which Is Quite Noisy! Initially Reception Were Reluctant To Help  But I Was Very Glad That Fed Stepped In To Help  Thank You.,,,,,
,4202,A Fabulous Weekend With Excellent Service  Truely Relaxing And Definately To Be Repeated,,,,,
,4213,Service Service Service!!,,,,,
,4216,Loved The Experiance Of The Old Castle With Fabulous Staff But Was Disappointed With The Room As It Was Quite Small. We Both Like To Retire To The Room Late Afternoon For A Rest  Then Dress For Dinner.,,,,,
,4219,Friendly  Good Service  House Guest Rather An Hotel Feel. Expensive However.,,,,,
,4220,It Was For A Friends 50Th And Everything Was Perfect,,,,,
,4227,Poor Value Overall.  Some Maddening Features Like A Service Charge For Accommodation - I've Never Seen This Before.,,,,,
,4293,Too Short,,,,,
,4294,Excellent Place To Organise An Event. Rebecca Was Very Helpful In Setting Things Up In Advance. Food Was Very Good On The Night Of The Event And Having A Choice Between A Set Menu And The A'la Carte Was Also Very Good.,,,,,
,4299,Superb Service And Food  Excellant Venue To Host A Sales Meeting Gave Us A Real Focus On Our Meeting In Relaxed Surnoundings,,,,,
,4312,Ok. The Room Was Tired Looking As Were The Bath Robes. I Did Not Want To Walk On The Carpet Bare Foot And The Room Smelt Of Damp Dog.  I Was Expecting More For The Price I Paid.,,,,,
,4314,Very Relaxing  Pleasant And Enjoyable,,,,,
,4328,Good And Pleasant  Welcoming Staff And Beautiful Surroundings Inside Outside,,,,,
,4344,Particularly Enjoyed The Beautiful Reception Rooms And Log Fires But Felt The Hotel Is Let Down By The Restaurant.,,,,,
,4349,It's Always Fabulous And This Time Was No Different - The Staff Are Amazing.,,,,,
,4358,Mixed.  Food And Dining Good.  Public Areas - Lounge And Bar Variable Service And Availability.  Low Doors/Beams In Castle Room.,,,,,
,4371,Relaxing,,,,,
,4379,Very Comfortable And Relaxing With Wonderful Food,,,,,
,4385,Dear Mr. Aresti  Hoping You Are Well. Based On My Most Recent Experience  I Would Never Recommend Bove To Anyone. I Believe The Management Of My Situation With The Booking Was Unconscionable And Represents Over-All Near The Worst Management Of Client Service In Practically Any Experience I Have Had At What Preports To Be A World Class Establishment. It Caused Enormous Stress For My Family  For Myself  And Detracted From Our Stay Immensely. The Castle And Grounds Are So Special  And The Area So Magnificent  And It Is Such A Shame That So Much Of That Is Basically Ruined Some Of The Management.,,,,,
,4415,Relaxing Enjoyable Stay.,,,,,
,4491,From The Moment We Were Greeted And Luggage Taken To Our Room  To Cream Teas Enjoyed In The Oak Room And Finally An Evening Meal Taken In The Edwardian Restaurant The Service Was Impeccable At All Times.  Nothing Was To Much Trouble  Which Made Our Stay Above And Beyond All Expectations.  We Hope To Stay Again Very Soon.  Regards Ian & Janice Wall,,,,,
,4500,Very Much Enjoyed Our Stay We Stayed In Room 35 Needed So Attention Also Threadbare Carpets On The Stair Cases Etc That Being Said Staff Very Good,,,,,
,4530,Totally Relaxing And Spoilt. Beautiful Surroundings Inside And Out That Add To The Charm. If I Have A Critisisum There Are Only Two Small Observations  The Service While In The Lounges Was A Bit Slow If You Were Reading And Wanting Tea. Also While Seated In Front Of The Fire In The Bar/Lounge The Staff Would Walk/Cross In Front Of You While Behind There Is A Natural Thouroughfare From The Door Straight To The Bar. It Felt Like Your Space Was Being Invaded As Your Relaxing.,,,,,
,4546,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,4597,A Mix Of Very Good  Good And Distinctly Average,,,,,
,4620,Beautiful Bedroom And Public Lounges.  Excellent Spa  Pool.  Had A Walk In Your Beautiful Grounds And Fun Falcon Thing In The Morning.  Good For All Weathers.  Only Negative Is The Restaurants - Edwardian Grill Expensive And Unexciting Menu  The Brasserie/Bistro Food Well Below The Standard Of The Hotel.  Nothing Really Wrong With It  But Nothing Really Right With It Either - Roughly 2 Or 3 Star Quality.,,,,,
,4621,Very Impressive Hotel And Grounds. Staff All Friendly And Helpful. Decor A Little Tired Since Last Renovation In (I Think) 2006.,,,,,
,4624,Lovely Weekend,,,,,
,4626,Ridiculously Expensive And The Service Was Poor,,,,,
,4660,Lovely Old Building And Location. Not As Relaxing As Anticipated.,,,,,
,4698,Lovely Relaxing,,,,,
,4729,We Enjoyed Our Stay As The Service Was Excellent From The Moment We Stepped Out Of The Car With The Bus Boy  Reception & Staff In Both Restaurants. The Room Was Comfortable & Clean With We Appreciated.,,,,,
,4732,Below Our Expectations Of A Venue With Some Reputation For Being A First Class Experience.,,,,,
,4751,Fantastic,,,,,
,4761,A Perfect Break Except For The Weather,,,,,
,4788,Delightful. We Loved It And Only Wish We Could Have Stayed Longer.,,,,,
,4832,Generally Service Was Good But Breakfast Appeared To Be Disorganised And Slow And Service In The Bar Was Slow Too. Room And Other Facilities Were Excellent.,,,,,
,4845,Good Points:- The Food  Staff  Buildings/Fixtures And Fittings  Comfort  Views/Location  Swimming Pool And Quality Towels  Linen Robes Etc. Not So Good :- Some Refurbishment Needed ( Bedroom  And Bathroom Were A Little Tired) And The Golf Course Could Do With A Redesign And Better Maintenance. Not Too Happy Either About Service Charge Being Added To Every Bill.,,,,,
,4849,I Enjoyed The Golf Course And The Views And The Staff Were All Very Pleasant And Helpful But We Had A Major Hickup With Are Bills And Generally I Don't Feel It Was Good Value For What We Paid.,,,,,
,4855,Poor Check In - Wasn't Given Key To Room And Second Key When Fetched Was Wrong Key. Pleasant Staff. Average Food. Slow Service In Bar And Restaurant. ,,,,,
,4856,Great Service  But We Were Part Of A V Large Party  Which Was V Well Organised,,,,,
,4859,Wonderful! Friendly Staff/ Amazing Setting ,,,,,
,4861,My Favourite Hotel ,,,,,
,4862,Perfectly Relaxing,,,,,
,4863,It Was Perfect. I Was Celebrating A Birthday And The Experience Was All That Was Promised And More,,,,,
,4864,Beautiful Place But Disappointed With Food,,,,,
,4866,Best In Everyway. Staff Could Not Be Better Or More Helpful. Menu And Dining Experience Memorable. The Grounds So Beautiful. ,,,,,
,4867,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Experience Although One Or Two Issues Concerning Food!,,,,,
,4868,We Were Very Well Looked After And The Feedback We Got Back From Our Guests Was Positive.,,,,,
,4869,Fantastic Building And Setting,,,,,
,4870,Good Staff In All Departments Enhanced A Very Good Hotel In An Excellent Location,,,,,
,4871,Beautiful Setting....  Attendinglarge Private Party In Teh Edwardian Room.    Staff Very Helpful And Good.   Not Sure The Standard Of Food Was Up To The Rest Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,4872,We Have Stayed Over The Last 4 Years Regularly At The Lodges Which I'm Afraid Need An Upgrade Now.  Four  Of Us Went To Dine At The Bistro Which Was Very Poor With The Presentation And Quality Not A Five Star Standard I'm Sorry To Say!,,,,,
,4873,Very Enjoyable   Staff All Worked Hard To Make It A Truly Exceptional Experiance,,,,,
,4875,Excelleng Venue For A Celebration Party. Very Friendly Staff. Superb Walks In The Countryside. We Enjoyed The Falconry Display.,,,,,
,4879,Not Only A Great Venue But The Staff Were Fantastic Which Makes It A Great Experience.  You Can Have A Best Hotel And Views In The World But If You Dont Have The Staff Then You You Just Have A Nice Hotel.  Bovey Had Great Staff Which Is The Icing On The Cake,,,,,
,4880,First 24Hrs Was Excellent  But On Second Evening Whilst You Gave Us The Time For Dinner  There Was A Lot Of Waiting  When Other People Coming Into The Bar Went Into Their Meal Before Us.  Also We Had To Go And Ask For A Drink After Waiting For Quite A While.  Ruined The Weekend.,,,,,
,4881,Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,4882,Lovely Hotel In Wonderful Countryside. Food  Comfort  And  Staff All Excellent,,,,,
,4883,Very Friendly And Relaxing,,,,,
,4884,Outstanding Setting And Staff  All Exceptionally Attentive And Proffessional.,,,,,
,4885,Welcoming And Luxurious.  Service Staff Was Amazing.,,,,,
,4886,Great Experiance For The Wedding,,,,,
,4889,Cosy  Special Experience And Home Away From Home,,,,,
,4890,It Was Delightful.  Thought The Bistro Could Have Been Decorated Slightly Less Cafe Is But More Bistro,,,,,
,4892,Stunning Hotel With Excellent Helpful Staff In Beautiful Surroundings,,,,,
,4893,Excellent Service And Facilities. A Great Escape.,,,,,
,4894,I Had A Amazing Stay At Bovey Castle As Always. It Was A Return Visit For Myself But The First Time I Had Stayed There With My Partner And I Was So Pleased That He Enjoyed It As Much As I Did And Our Weekend More Than Lived Up To All The Stories I Had Told Him About Previous Visits.  The Customer Service From All Of The Staff Is Faultless And Really Did Make Such Difference To Our Stay. They Are Always Friendly  Helpful And Always Ready To Chat Or Have A Little Joke With You.   We Enjoyed Our Wine Tasting Experience With David Which Was Excellent  He Is A Real Gentleman. We Also Did A Cocktail Making Master Class Which Was Also Great Fun And I Would Recommend To Anyone - The Host (He Was Welsh But Sadly I Can't Remember His Name) Created A Brilliant Atmosphere With His Cheeky Charm  Great Choice Of Background Music And An Infectious Passion For Great Cocktails.   We Are Already Looking Forward To Booking A Return Visit  Hopefully In The Summer.  ,,,,,
,4895,A Peaceful Rest In A Wonderful Old Building With Small Private Areas To Relax. The Staff Were Outstanding On The Desk  At The Entrance And For Housekeeping  Public Rooms And Restaurant Service.,,,,,
,4896,Quiet And Luxurious,,,,,
,4897,Very Enjoyable Experience.,,,,,
,4898,Home From Home  But With The Non Intrusive Pampering And Beautiful Surroundings,,,,,
,4900,Just Enough Attention To Detail Without Going Over Board.,,,,,
,4901,Pleasant Stay With Some Minor Glitches,,,,,
,4902,Amazing. The Service Was Great  The Atmosphere Was Great  The Facilities Were Great  Overall...Great!!!,,,,,
,4903,Had A Wonderful Stay  However We Were Disappointed With The Breakfast Service. We Arrived For Breakfast At 10.15 To Find There Was No Hot Food Available  Eventually A Waiter Took Our Order And Brought Our Food To The Table. We Waited For A Considerable Time To Be Offered Tea Or Coffee And Toast. It Seemed To Us That Although We Loved Our Room  And The Dinner And The Whole Ambience Of The Castle  Our Experience Was Let Down By The Breakfast Service.,,,,,
,4904,Excellent,,,,,
,4905,A Really Terrific Weekend With Terrific Staff,,,,,
,4906,A Wonderful Week Enjoying Rest And Relaxation In The Most Beautiful Surroundings  Made Even More Special Because We Could Share It With Our Little Dog Molly. We Have Never Come Across A 5Star Quality Hotel That Is So Dog Friendly. We Are Already Planning A Return Visit And Would Not Stay At Any Other Venue When In The Area. Thankyou So Very Much For A Lovely Lovely Stay.,,,,,
,4907,Our Previous Stay Was Fantastic  We Had A Lovely Relaxing Time And The Food Was Excellent So We Decided To Treat Ourselves For Our Anniversary Again This Year.  This Stay Was Totally Spoilt By An Issue We Had In The Early Hours Of The Morning Which We Reported At The Time And Subsequently Had To Move Rooms.  The Matter Was Further Reported To The Hotel Manage In The Morning  The Response Of Which We Are Still Awaiting.  Also In The Bathroom Of Room 19 The Sink Was Cracked Which We Feel For Such A Highly Rated Hotel Should Of Been Addressed.,,,,,
,4908,Fantastic Room  Good Food. Service In Restaurant For Breakfast Was Rubbish,,,,,
,4909,Incredible Experience!,,,,,
,4910,Very Relaxing But Evening Meal Would Have Been Lovley If It Was Hotas Ours Was Cold    ,,,,,
,4913,Enjoyable,,,,,
,4914,A Very Impressive Venue  A Wonderful Building Inside And Out In An Amazing Location.,,,,,
,4915,Very Relaxing And Perfect For Our 2 Small Children.,,,,,
,4916,Excellent,,,,,
,4918,Wonderful Service And Attention To Detail,,,,,
,4919,Very Special The Atmosphere Was Formal But Relaxed At The Same Time Staff Were Great We Love It,,,,,
,4922,Beautiful Place With Lovely Rooms  Check In Staff Excellent  Restaurant Staff Very Slow And The Cooked Breakfast Was Not Very Good. The Price Of Drinks Is Extortionate!,,,,,
,4925,A Bit Hit And Miss. Reception And Front Ouf House Staff Were Excellent  As Was Leah Who Was Looking After Our Function. Restaurant Staff And Bar Staff Were Inconsistent.,,,,,
,4926,Excellent In Every Way - People  Food  Accomodation - We Wanted To Relax In An Area With Little Or Nothing Nearby And The Hotel And Grounds Met These 100% - ,,,,,
,4929,A Wonderful Experience From Arrival To Departure. Extremely Helpful And Attentive Staff At All Times. Very Professional Service. Would Love To Visit Again When Time Permits. ,,,,,
,4930,Bogey  Castle Is A Lovely Place.  The Staff  Service  Food And Facilities Other Than Our Bedroom  Were All Excellent.   We Had A Confirmation Email Of Our Booking Of A Classic Room  On 26Th September For Our Stay Last Saturday 23Rd November.   On The Website The Classic Rooms Are Described As Having Restricted Views.  Our Room Had No View  We Looked Out On To Drainpipes  Flues And Roof Tiles.  We Were Woken At 7 Am By The Noise Of The Flues Which Was Improved By Shutting Our Window.   If This Room Was The Only One Available To Us When We Booked In September  It Would Have Been Helpful To Have Had It Explained  So We Could Have Had The Opportunity To Either Ask For Another Room Or Book Somewhere Else.,,,,,
,4936,V Enjoyable Party Of A Friend  Bedroom V Basic For Price Paid Even Though A Special Rate  Staff Seemed V Stretched At Dinner And Especially Breakfast,,,,,
,4937,Very Comfortable Rooms And Excellent Service.,,,,,
,4938,The Lodge Was Perfect For A Family Gathering And We Made Full Use Of The Hotels Facilities And Activities,,,,,
,4939,Relaxed Luxury,,,,,
,4940,Wonderful. The Hotel Is Fabulous And The Staff Couldn't Have Been More Helpful. The Food Was Great And Everywhere Was Warm And Comfortable. Slight Hiccup When We Realised That The Bathroom Heating Was Faulty But We Were Offered Another Room. We Had Already Unpacked And As We Were Only There For One Night We Declined. If And When We Can Afford The Luxury Of Your Hotel Again We Would Certainly Return. A Small Addition Of A Handrail In The Shower Would Make It Safer For Older People Like Us. Thanks To Everyone. Marian And Henry Scott,,,,,
,4941,Good  But Found The Service Charges Added To Each Item An Annoyance.,,,,,
,4942,Brilliant. However Disappointed When I Got Home To See We Could Have Stayed For Half The Price On Our Secret Escapes Account. ,,,,,
,4944,Very Good Experience. My Wife And I Have Already Recommended Bovey Castle. ,,,,,
,4946,Taking Into Account  Location  Building Including The Hotel Room  Food And General Service Levels Bovey Castle Offers A Near Unique Experience. However  The True Test Is Whether I Would Have The Same Opinion Had The Hotel And Apartments Been Full. Incidentally  In My Opinion The Apartments Are Overpriced And Presumably Geared For Short Stays Rather Than A Week. ,,,,,
,4947,The Lack Of Phone Signal Means I Cannot Come Again During The Week  So We've Booked A Weekend In January. The Staff Were Brilliant,,,,,
,4948,Relaxing Treat In Stunning Surroundings With Very Polite And Helpful Staff.,,,,,
,4949,Wonderful  Peaceful Location  Faultless Attention To Detail,,,,,
,4950,Good Break,,,,,
,4952,Really Enjoyed Our Stay At This Lovely Location,,,,,
,4953,Fantastic  It Was A Great Experience With Incredible Facilities,,,,,
,4954,We Enjoyed Our Experience At Bovey However Felt That Some Of The Staff Could Have Been More Friendly.,,,,,
,4955,We Held Our Wedding At Bovey 20 Years Ago And Had Not Stayed Since. Whilst We Booked Via Secret Escapes And Got A Good Price  The Service At Reception Was Disgraceful. The Hotel Was Almost Empty But We Were Given A Room Tucked Away  The Response To Our Conversation Was Minimal And We Were Shocked By The Overall Lack Of Interest In Us As Guests. The Restaurant Service Made Up For It Although We Also Felt The Waiters Were Almost Over-Familiar. When We Suggested Next Day That We Could Have Been Given A Better Room (Ours Was Room 36 In What Was Clearly The Servants'quarters  Reached By Threadbare Carpets And Gloomy Lighting) The Receptionist Just Shrugged. As We Are Buying Ahouse In The Area We Plan To Be Back On Several Occasions In The Future But I Am Sure I Can Find Somewhere Else More Welcoming And Appreciative Of Our Business. We Spent Over £300 On A Single Night In November Which   Despite The Dbb Offer  Is Not Insubstantial. I Very Much Look Forward To Hearing A Response From Management.,,,,,
,4956,Excellent In All Ways Except Bedrooms Which Were Comfortable But Not Particularly Luxurious.,,,,,
,4957,Very Enjoyable Short Break. Extremely Pleasant And Helpful Staff Added To The Positive Experience.,,,,,
,4958,Generally Very Good But A Few Things Went Wrong.,,,,,
,4959,A Wonderful Celebration In A Glorious Setting,,,,,
,4961,Very Nice. Lauren Who Received Us At The Door Made A Special Effort To Take Us Around The Castle And Introduce Us To All Facilities. Please Thank Her On Our Behalf And We Thought She Was Very Welcoming.,,,,,
,4962,Absolutely Fantastic; Looking Forward For Returning For New Year,,,,,
,4963,Very Luxurious.   The Cafe Let The Quality Of The Rest Of The Hotel Down A Bit - Even Though The Food Was Delicious.,,,,,
,4964,We Had A Lovely Time And Definitely Intend To Come Back. We Had Heard About Bovey Castle (We Live Quite Nearby) But The Special Deal Through Special Escapes Clinched It!,,,,,
,4966,Well Looked After Excellent Service And Customer Excellent Care,,,,,
,4970,Lovely Room  Amazing Venue  Slightly Let Down By Food In Bistro And 12.5% Charge.,,,,,
,4971,Pricey,,,,,
,4972,Very Comfortable - Great Room - Delicious Supper In The Bistro,,,,,
,4973,We Had A Lovely Time. The Staff Were Great. We Felt Able To Relax In The Beautiful Lounges,,,,,
,4974,Beautiful Hotel    Lack Of A Bitter To Drink From The Bar .. Disappointed With The Mattress In The Room As Seemed To Be 2 Singles Joined Together  At This Price I Would Expect A Double Mattress.. Food Service Was Painfully Slow On What Looked Like A Quiet Night  Even Though Staff Levels Seemed More Than Enough ....... Far To Long Between Being Called In For Dinner  Followed By A Long Wait For The Starter That Could Have Been Slightly Larger  I Am Sure 3 Scallops Would Be Better ....... Another Painfully Long Wait For The Main Course  So Finished Dinner After 2200 Hrs .. Breakfast Again Painfully Slow  With Only 2 Other People In The Restaurant And Plenty Of Staff.. To The Point That One Of Our Party Had To Leave Before Breakfast Arrived  Having Waited 25 Minutes At Least And Another Was Incorrect But We Couldn't Wait Any Longer   A Real Shame As It Was A Very Nice Breakfast ,,,,,
,4975,A Very Enjoyable Experience,,,,,
,4977,Wonderful,,,,,
,4978,Staff Very Helpful  Nice Decor  Good Facilities  Beautiful Gardens,,,,,
,4979,Lovely Accommodation  Great Location  Super Food  Amazing Staff.,,,,,
,4980,Great -Staff Were Very Good  Room Was Comfortable.  ,,,,,
,4982,Lovely  Everyone Is So Friendly And Makes You Feel At Home As Soon As You Arrive.,,,,,
,4983,We Only Turned Up At 1400Hrs For Wedding At 1500. Booked Into Room Got Changed And Was At The Wedding Until 2300 Then Went To Bed. Had A Little Look Around But Feel We Didnt Experienced The Whole Magic Of What Bovey Castle Has To Offer.,,,,,
,4984,Stunning Setting.Amazing Public Rooms.Good Food Average Bedroom.Good Service (Although Charged To The Limit) My Main Gripe Dead Flowers Everywhere.Dead Ameriliss Dead Leopard Lily Dying Poinsettia All In Plastic Pots Really!!  ,,,,,
,4985,Could Not Sleep Due To Banging Door Below  Pond Water To Bathe In  Bathroom Needed Refurb  Good Food Friendly Staff,,,,,
,4986,The Food And Staff Of The Edwardian Both Dinner And Breakfast Were Outstanding  The Wedding Planner Was Terrible  Reception Was Cold And Carless  House Keeping Was Great  Tea Room Was Too Busy To Care About Us,,,,,
,4987,Fantastic It Is The Most Beautiful Hotel We Have Ever Stayed In The Service Was Second To None And The Friendliness Of The Staff Was Wonderful The Owners Should Be Proud Of What There Staff Have Achieved.,,,,,
,4989,Extremely Good. Customer Service Was Brilliant; Polite  Friendly And Helped Us With Our Every Need. The Spa Treatments Were Also Equally As Lovely. ,,,,,
,4990,Lovely  But Having No Water For The Monday Evening Spoilt Our Break And Created Embarrassing Situations. On Checking Out There Was No Mention Of The Reason Or Apology / Discount For The Inconvenience,,,,,
,4991,Wonderful,,,,,
,4992,Fantastic - We Stayed In A Lodge.  We Were So Well Looked After By Everyone And Made To Feel So Welcome.  It's The Best Experience I Have Ever Had In The Uk.  Truly Magical - Enhanced By The Festive Spirit  The 50 Foot Christmas Tree And Frederico's Curtesy And Friendliness.  Thank You So Much For Making Our Special Moment Together - Fantastic.,,,,,
,4994,Good Service And Excellent Food  Disappointed With The Cost Of Drinks,,,,,
,4995,Absolute Luxury,,,,,
,4996,Excellent Service  Fantastic Surroundings  Superb Food.,,,,,
,4997,Beautiful Hotel Inside  Lovely Grounds And Pool  Friendly Staff,,,,,
,4998,Relaxing  Great Service And Attention To The Details  Thank You.,,,,,
,4999,Generally Very Good  Well Positioned Bedroom Overlooking The Countryside.  Public Areas Very Comfortable.  Staff In General Very Friendly  Especially Alex With The Ferrets!  We Found Sometimes Service Could Be Slightly Slower Than We Expected But Realise The Hotel Was Quite Busy At Time We Visited.  Found The Price Of Drinks To Be On The High Side. Ate In The Bistro And In The Edwardian Grill On Both Occasions Food Was Good.  On One Occasion Members Of Our Party Ordered Hot Chocolate Which Came Out Luke Warm And Had To Be Returned - Only A Small Point But Not What We Would Have Expected.  Used The Swimming Pool Which Was Lovely.  All In All Had A Lovely Short Break Before Christmas. ,,,,,
,5003,Wonderful Atmosphere And Great Service  A Fantastic Break To Relax All Senses,,,,,
,5009,Relaxing And Comfortable Without Any Pretense.,,,,,
,5010,We Had The Most Wonderful Time-It Was My Daughters Wedding. All The Staff Were Excellent-Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. I Only Wish I Could Have Stayed For A Few More Days!! ,,,,,
,5011,Too Expensive - Paid A Lot For Room But No Breakfast Included  Even Though Part Of The Wedding Party. Drinks At Bar Ridiculously Over Priced  So Unlikely To Stay Again  Even Though Setting Beautiful  Food Good And Dog Allowed (Even Though At Cost Of £20 When Most Hotels Charge £10!),,,,,
,5012,Relaxing  Excellent  Intentive  Professional And Federico You Made It Happen. Without You There Would Be Not Great Team To Work With. Thanks For Everything And Your Staff.,,,,,
,5014,Quite Enjoyable. It Did Feel That The Hotel Was Busy Gearing Up For The Xmas Holiday Period Next Week  Rather Than Concentrating On 'Now' ,,,,,
,5015,The Hotel - Stunning  Our Room  35  Ok. Minor Niggles- The Bath Paneling Was Tatty And Needed Painting; Damp Around The Window; Smell Of Paint In The Room But Overall Very Comfortable. Note For Future Bathroom Design- A Bathroom Of This Size Should Have Double Sinks. My Main Gripe Would Be The Carpet On The Back Staircase  Ancient And Threadbare! We Considered Upgrading But Felt There Was Not Enough Difference To Warrant The Tariff Increase  General Note To Reception Staff When Trying To Present An Upgrade Do Not Show A Room With Identical Decor  I Am Sure There Are A Number Of Decorating Styles In Every Room Category. The Only Benefit We Could See To Upgrading Was A Slightly Larger  Squarer Shaped Room With Better Views-Not Important In The Depths Of Winter When It Is Dark So Early. Our Meal In The Edwardian Grill With Two Non Resident Relatives Was Superb  The Food Was Excellent  My Only Minor Disappointment- That The Petit Fours Did Not Include Chocolate Truffles Or Anything Containing Chocolate! The Pool/Spa Area Was Stylish And Spotlessly Clean. The Sauna Unfortunately Was Not Hot Enough Due To A Power Cut.  Overall An Exceedingly Enjoyable Break.,,,,,
,5016,Excellent,,,,,
,5018,It Was Not As 5* As Expected,,,,,
,5019,Very Good,,,,,
,5020,It's One Of The Few Services Which Has A America Customer Care With A English Attitude.. Have The Wifi Is Free Extra Part A Great Service. ,,,,,
,5021,Decidant ,,,,,
,5022,Full Of (The Most Unpleasant) Surprises. Total Lack Of Management Concern,,,,,
,5023,Wonderful Surroundings And So Relaxing.,,,,,
,5024,We Felt Welcomed From The Moment We Arrived. Really Helpful Kind Staff. A Fantastic Location  Lovely Room  Great Evening Meal And Breakfast. Merlin The Owl Was Impressive Too ;-),,,,,
,5025,Fantastic ,,,,,
,5026,Lots Of Food!!,,,,,
,5027,Excellent,,,,,
,5028,Was Amazing  Thank You Very Much Indeed :),,,,,
,5029,First Class As Always,,,,,
,5030,Excellent,,,,,
,5031,Very Relaxing Experience. Staff First Class  Good Food  Relaxed Atmosphere. Superb Pool,,,,,
,5032,Wonderful. Felt Deep In The Heart Of The Moors.,,,,,
,5035,Excellent Service From All The Staff. ,,,,,
,5036,Great  But Expensive.,,,,,
,5037,Fantastic Experience! Everyone Made Us Very Welcome And The Staff Could Not Do More For Us To Make Our Stay More Perfect. ,,,,,
,5038,The Experience Was First Class From Arrival To Departure  I Genuinely Could Not Find Fault With Any Aspect Of Our Stay And Your Staff Are A Real Credit To You And The Industry,,,,,
,5039,Amazing! My Favourite Hotel. Amazing Service Too. ,,,,,
,5040,Wonderful Place Overall With Truly First Class Service. We Got The Impression That The Lodge  However  Was Not Owned By The Hotle And Suffered From A Slight Lack Of Tlc - Small Things - Like The Technology Was Pooer (Poor/Limited Tv  No Ipod Audio Capability  Wifi Wouldnt Work With Apple Tv). Dishwasher Neeeded Fixing  Clocks Werent Correctly Set  Kitchen Kitted Out Relatively Basically). However  Service Quality And Reponse Made Up For A Lot  And Basically No Complaints.,,,,,
,5041,Wonderful Hotel  Staff Good  Room Also Good   Bistro Very Underwhelming  Breakfast Ordinary. 5* Hotel With 3* Food  I Didn't Try Main Restaurant  Put Off By The Cost Of The Cheapest Bottle Of Wine.  ,,,,,
,5042,A True English Countryside Experience With Tons Of Fun And Unique Activities For Kids,,,,,
,5044,Really Relaxed   Beautiful Location  Felt Very Welcome And Cared For From The Moment We Arrived Until The Time We Left. ,,,,,
,5046,An Absolutely Perfect Christmas!,,,,,
,5047,It Was A Truly Great Experience. The Staff Were Attentive And Friendly And The Overall Attention  To Detail Was Second To None. Thank You For A Super Festive Break!,,,,,
,5048,Your Christmas Arrangements Were Very Good With Plenty Going On To Keep Our Family Happy  Generous Hospitality Lovely Staff   Wonderful Atmosphere    A Super Christmas And Such Enthusiasm For The Guests Enjoyment By Federico . Well Done And Thank You,,,,,
,5049,Perfect. Cant Think Of Anything More That Anyone Could Have Done  A Fantastic Christmas!,,,,,
,5050,Very Welcoming  Relaxing  And With Many Things To Do Or See.  The Staff Are Excellent. They Are Well Trained - So They Do Their Job Well - But They Are Also Genuinely Friendly And Helpful. Nothing Was Too Much Trouble And Everything Was Done Just Right. We Felt Comfortable At Bovey And Appreciated All The Small Details. ,,,,,
,5052,Amazing Christmas Experience For Families.,,,,,
,5053,The Lodge -Cleave For Was Excellent,,,,,
,5054,Excellent Service With Our Every Wish Catered For.,,,,,
,5055,A Very Warm  Relaxed And Friendly Atmosphere Was Apparent As Soon As We Arrived And This Prevailed Throughout Our Stay. If You Want To Be Cosseted In A Relaxed And Friendly Way  This Is The Place To Go To.,,,,,
,5057,Welcoming And Comfortable.  Your Staff Are Well Trained And Very Friendly. They Manage To Combine Professionalism With Genuine Warmth. Very Impressive. ,,,,,
,5060,A Lovely All-Round Experience.,,,,,
,5061,Bovey Castle Is An Amazing Place To Stay. The Grounds And Facilities Are First Class. A Couple Of Areas To Improve Would Be An Update To Carpets And Sofas In The Lodge We Stayed In (Ingle Tor). We Also Had To Complain About Maintenance Noise During Our Stay. A Little Unexpected At A Five Star Retreat.,,,,,
,5062,Lovely Cosy Relaxing Christmas Break With The Family With Plenty Of Activities For The Children And A Super Environment For The Adults.,,,,,
,5063,A 1 I.E Top,,,,,
,5066,Hotel Decorated For Christmas Definitely Had The Wow Factor - -  Pool And Sauna Excellent  - - -Room Was Comfortable And Well Appointed  - - - Food In The Bistro Was Quite Dissappointing.All Staff We Encountered Were Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,5067,Very Comfortable - We Were In A Lodge And Enjoyed The Ability To Do Our Own Thing And Then Make Use Of The Castle Comforts Whenever We Liked.  Staff Were All So Friendly And Accommodating When Needed And Seemed To Know When To Leave You Alone To Enjoy The Bovey Experience.  It Felt Like A Home From Home.,,,,,
,5068,Staff Were Friendly  Warm Welcome (Although No Power  Due To Power Cut!)  Dinner In The Grill Restaurant Was Lovely.  When We Checked Out Though We Were Not Asked If Everything Was Ok Or How Our Stay Went Etc. So  I Am Glad For This Survey As The Breakfast Which We Had Ordered With Room Service Was A Bit Disappointing - My Scrambled Egg Was Missing  There Was No Sauces (Tomato  Brown Etc) There Was No Salt  No Pepper. There Was Not Enough Hot Milk With Comparison To Coffee (Which Wasn't Hot).  I Would Love To See Thick Cut Fresh Bread Served With Breakfast And Also Tooth Picks On Tables !,,,,,
,5069,Terrible Experience With  Pool Not Being Open For Children.  Room Dirty.  Spoon In In-Rom Tea Box Dirty.  Wallpaper Missing.  Paint Peeling.  Roof Leaking In Lounges  Towels Along Windows To Prevent Drafts.   Damp On Staircase To Basement.  Carpet Worn Through In Halls And Stairs.  ,,,,,
,5070,Pretty Good Apart From The Room Which Had Broken Windows That Whistled In The Wind And Caused Major Sleep Disruption,,,,,
,5071,It Was Not Quite Up To Expectations.  The Tv In One Of Our Rooms Was Not Working Properly - Poor Sound.  The Carpets On The Stairs Were Thread Bear Which Did Not Meet With The Grand Experience Upon Arrival.  Breakfast Was Disappointing As We Had To Ask 3 Times For Coffee And The Meat Options Were Not Ready For The Breakfast Diners,,,,,
,5072,Very Relaxing And Other Than When The Wedding Was On Never Too Busy .Dissapointing The Bikes Were Not Available,,,,,
,5073,Staff Friendly  Not So Much At Reception  Dealt With Chalet Issues As Best They Could,,,,,
,5074,A Great Place To Stay And Relax,,,,,
,5075,Very Well Looked After By Attentive Staff Except In The Edwardian Room Where They Appeared Under Pressure,,,,,
,5076,As Usual It Was Superb. All The Staff And Facilities Are Great  Food Fabulous ,,,,,
,5077,Lovely Location  Hotel  Service Etc. ,,,,,
,5078,As Always All We Had Hoped For.,,,,,
,5079,Lovely  We Could Not Find Fault With Anything In Spite Of Power Cuts On Arrival And Stormy Weather That Made It Difficult To Enjoy The Fantastic Outdoor Space To The Full. I Would Recommend Selling Or Offering A Larger Selection Of Fresh Fruits In The Bistro (As An Option To Other Snacks And Desserts On The Menu) But This Is Really Just A Bonus Request  We Wanted For Nothing And Were So Well Looked After In Comfortable  Beautiful And Clean Spaces At Bovey Castle!,,,,,
,5083,The New Years Eve Package Was Excellent And Exceeded Our Expectations. The Staff Were Truly Outstanding - They Worked Incredibly Hard To Make Guests Feel Special Even Though The Hotel Was Extremely Busy. ,,,,,
,5086,Accommodation  Food And Service Excellent.  ,,,,,
,5089,We Love Every Visit To The Hotel And Enjoy The Bovey Rangers For The Children And The Excellent Service From The Stuff.  Eight Years Staying And Many More To Come. ,,,,,
,5090,Customer Service Was Great - All The Staff Were Very Pleasant And Very Helpful. Hotel Was Nicely Decorated For Christmas And Had A Nice Luxurious Feel In The Rooms.,,,,,
,5092,Beautiful Surroundings But Strange Inconsistences In Service,,,,,
,5094,We Had A Lovely Stay Only Marred By Friends Daughter's Behaviour And The Parents Lack Of Responsibility To Deal With Her. We Felt It Reflected Badly On Us Too Especially Their Failure To Apologise To You. Your Staff Were Superb And The Food And Attention We Received Were Excellent. I Can't Speak Highly Enough Of All Your Effort To Look After Your Guests. Thank You So Much Again And We Will Certainly Return Without The Other Family!,,,,,
,5095,We Found All Your Staff Very Friendly And Welcoming  In Particular Yourself Who Works Tirelessly In Every Possible Way And It Is Very Commendable And Much Appreciated. If We Have Any Comments  We Would Like To Mention That  The Coffee Served Is Very Strong And The Chips Served In The Restaurant With The Steak Were Rather Oily Even Though They Were Crisp And Tasty. Also We Were Very Concerned Regarding The Amount Of Candles Alight All Over The Bar And Lounge Areas  Particularly On New Years Eve When Many Guests Are Somewhat Worse For Drink!  It Not Only Puts All Your Guests And Staff At Risk But If There Were To Be A Serious Fire We Feel Your Hotel Insurance Would Not Cover You In These Circumstances! Also There Were A Few Young Ladies Completely Drunk During The Evening Sprawled On The Floor Having Dropped And Broken Champagne Glasses On The Oak Floor. It Was Also Unpleasant Having Visited The Ladies Toilet Before 9.00Pm To Find There Had Already Been An Incident In There Where Your Staff Had To Be Called To 'Clear Up' After These Women. We Had Hoped  Staying Somewhere Like Bovey Castle We Could Escape This Behaviour.,,,,,
,5096,A Fantastic Weekend  Made Even  Ore Memorable By The Staff Who Were All Exceptional,,,,,
,5097,The Hotel  The Surroundings And The Staff Are Amazing  Nothing Is Too Much Trouble For Everyone Of Those I Came Into Contact With. They Are Happy And Friendly  Bovey Castle Is My Favourite Hotel Ever For All The Reasons Listed Above. ,,,,,
,5098,A Truly Wonderful Christmas Made Extra Special By Extraordinary Staff Led By Great Manager - Totally Exceptional! We Have Not Stopped Telling People About It Since The Day We Got Home And Cannot Wait To Come Back.,,,,,
,5099,Made To Feel Special,,,,,
,5100,Dissapointed That The Evening Meal Was Not In Main Edwardian Room As This Was The Main Reason For Us Booking As It Was A Birthday Celebration I Had Booked For My Husband. Until We Were Shown To Out Table After Choosing From Menues Our Meal And Wine In The Lovely Bar We Found Ourselves Put In Side Room In A Very Tight Corner Close To Other  Dinner Guest. The Meal Was Enjoyable But Whole Experiance Was Spoiled.No Apology Was Offered And If We Had Been Advised Of This We Would Have  Chosen The Bistro  Which Had At Least Some Atmosphere.  The Evening Was Saved  As We Had Asked To Have Our Coffee In The Cathedral Lounge  By The Magnificant Tree And The Delightful Young Polish Waitress . ,,,,,
,5101,A Wonderful  Relaxing Start To The Christmas Break.  Thank You!,,,,,
,5102,Stayed In Rose Cottage Which Was Very Nice And Stayed Warm Over A Cold Period.  We Did Have 2 Leaks (Window And Roof) Which Was Rather Inconvenient (And Annoying Given How Much We Had Paid). Advert Implied That Garden Was Fully Enclosed For Dogs But This Was Not The Case. Lovely Gas Fires And Overall A Good Experience.,,,,,
,5103,Five Star Reception And Public Rooms  Some Exceptional Staff But Definitely Not Five Star Bedrooms. Our Bedroom Had Stains On The Armchairs  Carpets And Bathroom Walls. Some Of The Furniture Was Shabby (Not Shabby Chic  Just Shabby)  With Water Marks On Tables And Low Quality Chairs. We Were Underwhelmed With The Bedroom Quality And Disappointed To Have A Wardrobe That We Could Only Fit A Few Items Into On The Hanging Side And That Emitted A Terrible Smell From The Shelves Section. We Had To Hang Several Items Of Clothing Outside The Wardrobe Because Of The Lack Of Hanging Space. ,,,,,
,5104,Beautiful Setting  Lovely Room - Weather Terrible So Unable To Enjoy Any Outdoor Activities.  Absolutely Enchanted By The Hawks Which Took Part In The Display - We Have Been Talking About It Ever Since.  I Had A Sundari Spa Treatment Which Was Excellent And My Husband Took Part In A Guided Walk To Easdon Tor Which He Found Most Interesting.  The Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful But In Some Cases We Found Their Accents Difficult To Understand And Vice Versa.  One Other Comment - The Gala Dinner On New Years Eve Began At 8Pm And The Last Course Was Served After 11Pm Which Meant Long Gaps Between Them.  This Resulted In Us Getting Up To Have Our Coffee And A Cocktail In One Of The Lounges At 11.20 As We Were Falling Asleep!!  Apart From This We Enjoyed Every Minute And Will Definitely Be Returning.  I See From The Calendar That Ballooning Takes Place From Bovey Castle.  I Have Hot-Air Ballooned In Africa And The Usa And Love It So Would Definitely Like To Try That At Some Time!!   Joy Greep,,,,,
,5105,Welcoming  Friendly  Personal  Relaxing  Luxurious  Glamourous  Fun,,,,,
,5106,Our Experience At Bovey Castle Was Made Perfect By The Personal Attention Given To Us By The Manager Frederico. He Is The Most 'Hands On' Manager I Have Ever Come Across.  The Staff Were Always Smiling And Tried To Help Wherever And Whenever They Could. To Put On A Package To See In The New Year Must Be So Difficult But Everyone At Bovey Castle Made It Seem As If It Was An Every Day Occurrence And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Them.  Each Activity Was Fun And Flew By. The Food Was Good And Plentiful.  We Left Feeling That We Wanted More Which Is The Sign Of A Wonderful Stay. ,,,,,
,5107,A Truly Wonderful Experience ,,,,,
,5110,A Great Experience.  Good Atmosphere   Lovely Surroundings  Very Welcoming Staff From The Moment We Arrived. Lovely Facilities,,,,,
,5111,Excellent (And Bistro Much Improved!),,,,,
,5112,Completely Relaxing And Luxurious. Great Service But The Lodge Enabled Us To Keep Ourselves To Ourselves And Gave Us The Space. To Bring Our Puppy And 3 Boys  All Of Whom Loved The Outside Space. Quite Possibly The Very Best Uk Break We've Had And Exceptional Value Via H.H!,,,,,
,5113,We Had One Of The Lodges Which Are Lovely And Perfect For Larger Families With Dogs - Our Lodge Was A In Need Of A Little Tlc As Wallpaper Peeling Off In Bathrooms But Generally Very Nice - Also No Pegs To Hang Any Wet Coats :-( We Were In B2 - The Main Hotel Needs A Lot Of Tlc And Looking Tired Especially In The Pool And Spa - The Bar Was Our Favourite Room But It Has Huge Potential To Be Superb As All The Original Features Are Divine :-)Food Was Excellent In Edwardian Grill And Service Was Generally Pretty Good - We Did Think That The Extra Service Charges Especially Those For The Cleaning The Rooms Was Pretty Steep!! Considering We Were Paying Already For This Service ... ,,,,,
,5115,Excellent Stay Wonderful Staff And Customer Service  Fabulous Food And Room Well Done To All The Team !!,,,,,
,5117,We Had A Wonderful Stay. We Found The Staff Team To Be Friendly And Helpful At All Times. Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. The Castle Looked Beautiful With The Christmas Decorations. Thank You To All.,,,,,
,5118,Fantastic ,,,,,
,5119,Somewhere Very Special To Celebrate My Special Birthday With My Family.,,,,,
,5120,It Was Very Pleasant And Relaxing.,,,,,
,5122,Great Staff Very Helpful And Friendly,,,,,
,5123,One Of The Best New Year Celebrations I've Been To For Many Years. ,,,,,
,5124,Relaxing And Fun. The Kids Love It And So Do The Adults!,,,,,
,5125,We Had A Lovely Time... Beautiful Surroundings  Excellent Staff... Couldn't Fault It  Apart From The Drinks Being Really Expensive ! Would Definitely Recommend And Would Love To Return Again One Day.,,,,,
,5126,It Was Reasonable  Though Not Particularly Good Value For Money Despite The Promotional Offer I Took Advantage Of And I Certainly Wouldn't Pay Full Price. There Was Nowhere To Park Outside When I Arrived Because It Was Busy With People Arriving For Afternoon Tea  Though Check-In Was Handled Well And It Was Nice To Be Escorted To Our Room.  The Room Itself Was Relatively Small And The Bathroom Slightly Cramped - I Don't Understand Why There Was A Trolley Of Toiletries Taking Up Valuable Floor Space When A Couple Of Shelves Would've Served The Same Purpose To Better Effect  We Were Constantly Moving The Trolley Around To Keep It Out Of The Way. I'm Not Convinced About The Rattan-Style Floor Either  Surely Can't Be Very Hygenic (How Do You Clean It Properly)?  The Television Deserves Its Own Paragraph - It Was Truly Awful And The Most Obvious Negative Of Our Stay. Slow  Unresponsive  Clumsy Interface - Please Ditch It.  We Felt That Having A Charge Attached To All Service Detracted From The Experience Because We Were Never Sure If A Member Of Staff Was Being Helpful Or Being Paid.  I'd List A Few Positives But Am Restricted On Word Count.,,,,,
,5127,Lovely Building And Surroundings. Unfortunately Weather Was Very Wet  Therefore We Were Unable To Fully Appreciate The Grounds. Our One Night Stay Was Exceptionally Warm Temperature Wise  With Little Sleep Within Our Room. My Meal Within The Edwardian Was Also Disappointing.,,,,,
,5128,Fabulous Stay  First Class Service,,,,,
,5129,A Lovely Blend Of High End Service With Private Stately Home Comfort. We Were Made To Feel Very Special Without Being Over Attentive. Afternoon Tea Was A Highlight Of Our Stay  So Too Was Just Sitting In The Oak Room By The Fire.,,,,,
,5131,Very Welcoming And Comfortable In Lovely Surroundings,,,,,
,5132,The Service Was Very Good  The Food Excellent  Our Only Complaint Was The Room ( 52) Was Next To The Lift And The Very Noisy Hallway Kept Us Awake On Both Nights. ,,,,,
,5133,It Was Fabulous And The Service Excellent. Our Room ( Room 17) However Had Very Very Noisy Pipes Making A Noise Throughout The Night Which I Did Mention To Staff. Although Room Beautiful I Had A Very Sleepless Night :(  ,,,,,
,5134,Awesome. Extraordinary. Excellent Gastronomy And Your Human Resources Are Incredible!,,,,,
,5135,Its A Wonderful Location  Great Golf Course (But Obviously Not In January)  And A Curates Egg Of A Place A Lot Of The Time. We Like Quirky But Sometimes You Can Be So Irksome We Want To Scream!!!!!  ,,,,,
,5137,Simply Wonderful!,,,,,
,5138,Delightful!,,,,,
,5139,Our Stay Was Cut Short Due To A Burglary. We Were Very Grateful For The Offer A A Free Night In Due Course And We Are Looking Froward To A Trouble Free Stay Sometime Soon. The Hotel And Staff Were Great. Ironically  The Offer Made By The Manager Has Resulted In Several People Saying They Were Going To Look Up The Hotel  So I Hope The Kindness Is Well Rewarded. ,,,,,
,5140,We Stayed For Thre New Years Celebration And Are Very Impressed On How Everything Was Organised  We Hope To Come 2024/2015 Again!!,,,,,
,5141,Was A Lovely Place. Beautiful Scenery. Lovely Breakfast. Was Catered For In Everyway,,,,,
,5143,A Relaxing Stay Great For Children And Adults. With Friendly Happy Staff. We Felt Refreshed.  The Bistro Was Lovely For Lunch With Great Food. The Sole Was Perfectly Cooked And A Lovely Lemon Caper Butter. My Thai Infused Dish Was Lovely. Are Two Years Old Pizza Was Perfect And Nice To See Real Food Served To Children.  The Dinner In Edwardian Grill Was Very Good. My Only Comment Would Be That The Portion Of The Rabbit Starter Was Maybe A Bit Large. I Would Have Preferred A Better Balance With The Richness Of The Dish. My Scallops However Where Perfect.  The Duck Main Could Have Been A Little Smaller. And The White Chocolate Parfait Could Have Been A Little Smaller. I Say This As A Positive Tho Because The Food Really Showed Fantastic Cooking And Create Knowledge Of Taste. All Of The Front Of House Staff Where Very Well Led By The Restaurant Manager Even When It Was Noticeable For Us To See That They Where New Staff And Haven't Quite Gelled Together But Sure It Will Come. The Rest Of The Experience Was Great. ,,,,,
,5144,Staff Lovely ... Hotel Had Many Nice Unexpected Touches.  Very Much Liked The Work Ethic Of The Polish Guy Who Runs The Formal Dining Room.  Sadly The Weather Stopped My Husband Using The Golf Course But That Leaves Something To Come Back For . ,,,,,
,5145,We Had A Wonderful Time. We Stayed For Two Nights For Some R&R Before Our Baby Arrives  Due In 8 Weeks  And It Was Just What We Needed. We Only Wish We Could Have Stayed Longer.,,,,,
,5146,Out Of This World Very Hard To Put In To Words Hotel Was Top Class ,,,,,
,5148,Enchantingly English ,,,,,
,5149,Beautiful Building  Food Was Wonderful  Though Pricey.  Little Disappointed With Room (37) Just A Little Small And Overlooked The Car Park.  Third Time Visiting And Rooms We Are Given Seem To Get Smaller!!  All In All Though  Extremely Relaxing And Pleasant Place To Get Away From It All.,,,,,
,5150,We Enjoyed Our Stay Immensely (Despite The Weather). The Service And Friendly Staff Made Us Feel Very Special. The Evening Meal Was Lovely  As Was Breakfast (Plenty Of Choice). The Only Criticism Would Be The Banging Of Doors Early In The Morning. We Assumed Staff Were Arriving For Work (We Were In The Room Close To The Main Door). ,,,,,
,5151,One Long Lovely Party!,,,,,
,5152,Relaxing Luxury Break  Nice To Be Pampered And Treated Special,,,,,
,5153,Wonderful Stay,,,,,
,5154,Beautiful Place  Lovely Staff Very Homely And Comfortable. Look Forward To Seeing You All Again.,,,,,
,5155,I Am Extremely Disappointed To Hear That The Christmas Present I Had Booked For My Parents Was A Complete Waste Of Money.  My Parents Stayed At The Hotel Last Night And I Booked The Room Especially For Them As They Were In Desperate Need Of A Nice Romantic Break. I Am So Disappointed To Here That There Room Was Not Up To Standard And Nothing Like The Pictures On Your Website. I Have Attached Pictures Displaying Green Bath Water  Dirty Blinds  Thread Bare Carpet And Wore Out Lamp Shade. This Is Supposedly A Castle Valley Room!  For The Price I Paid For This Room This Is Far From Acceptable. I Will Not Be Recommending Bovey Castle To Anyone.  I Actually Stayed At The Hotel 5 Years Ago And It Was Lovely And I Had One If The Less Expensive Rooms And It Was Lovely. I Feel Awful That It Appears To Have Gone So Down Hill In The Last 5 Years And Am Extremely Gutted My Parents Didn't Have The Well Deserved Break They Needed.  I Hope You Value This Feed Back So No Other Guests Have To Encounter The Same Disappointment         Rebecca Crook 07850 576985 ,,,,,
,5156,Fantastic Setting - Disappointed In Food Offered In Edwardian Restaurant - Portions Barely Adequate And Lacking In Vegetables And Dessert Menu Was Totally Underwhelming That Even Two Females Who Enjoy Desserts Were Not Tempted At All - Noted Ladies On Next Table Reacted Similarly - Other Than Restaurant Enjoyed Stay Immensely And Breakfast Buffet Was Great ,,,,,
,5157,Excellent  Staff Service And Attitudes Make Or Break Any Business  Yours Are Delightful.,,,,,
,5158,It Was Great The Staff Were Really Accomodating And Helpful As Always. We Had A Really Good Time Was Very Relaxing. ,,,,,
,5159,Relaxed  Friendly  Beautiful Surroundings  Lovely Public Rooms  Excellent Service - Nothing Too Much Trouble For Staff.,,,,,
,5160,We Had  A Great Stay Service Amazing Food Delicious And We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome  We Had  Ababy And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. To Us Service Was Fantastic .,,,,,
,5161,Overall We Had A Very Enjoyable Time.  Room 28 Was Quite Musky When We Arrived And There Were Water Damage Marks Near The Windows And A Small Area Had Been Damaged In The Main Room.  The Roller Blind In The Bathroom Had Seen Better Days!!  I Feel The Bistro Could Be Improved And This Has Lowered Our Rating Of The Experience. Here Are Some Examples: Our Daughter Was Not Offered The Cordial From The Children's Menu.  We Were Not Aware It Was Included Until The End Of The Meal. When We Finished Our Main Course  We Waited Over 20 Mins For Someone To Ask Us If We Want A Dessert Or Some Drinks.  In The End We Left Without Having A Dessert Or Tea/Coffee The Couple On The Next Table Complained That They Had Found Soil In There Salad! ,,,,,
,5162,Great Friendly Service Accomodating To All Needs ,,,,,
,5163,Lived Up To Expectations. Not Too Posh To Make You Feel Uncomfortable. Very Comfortable Bed  Strange No Table To Put Kettle On And Tv Remote Not Working. Would Be Nice To Have Fresh Milk For Drinks. Heating Could Be Turned Down A Bit In Corridors. Food Was Excellent. Bit Disappointed With Bistro  Maybe A Cloth On Tables Would Be Nice In The Evenings. Overall A Lovely Place And Relaxing Experience. We Will Return.,,,,,
,5165,Everything Was Absolutely Wonderful. The Only Very Small Criticism We Had Was That We Were In A Hurry On The Day Of Checking Out  As We Needed To Get A Train. Breakfast Was Quite Slow Service Although The Host Was Incredibly Gracious.   Thank You Also For The Free Champagne On Arrival - Lovely Touch  And For Allowing Us To Have Cream Tea In Our Robes After The Spa!   The Girls On The Front Desk Were Wonderful And Very Helpful. As Well As Our Lovely Barman  Who's Name Escapes Me Now But I Believe Said He Was Originally From Kenya When Asked  Who Made Us Feel Incredibly Special And Welcome. He Deserves Full Credit For Making Us Spend Faaar Too Much On Champagne!  ,,,,,
,5166,A Comfortable And Relaxing Stay; Good But Not Outstanding Service; Some Parts Of The Hotel Were Tired.,,,,,
,5167,A Day To Get Away From The Pace Of Life And Work. Relaxing And Peaceful. A Day To Unwind In An Environment I Love -The Countryside.,,,,,
,5168,Very Relaxing Hideaway In A Modern Lodge.,,,,,
,5169,The Hotel Itself Is So Beautiful  We Felt Like Royalty Driving Up The Drive!  We Had A Warm Welcome  And All The Staff Were Exceptionally Helpful.  Our Room Was Lovely  Beautifully Decorated And Clean.  The Gardens Are Wonderful  As Is The Spa Our First Nights Meal Was Very Disappointing  However  My Husband Had A Large Lump Of Soil In His Rocket.  Despite My Telling Staff At Least Twice That I Need Food To Be Gluten Free  I Was Brought Chips Which Weren't Gluten Free The Waitress Took My Meal Away And Gave Me  Presumably The Same Steak (Which Could Have Been Contaminated But I Decided To Risk It Rather Than Cause Another Fuss)  And Brought Me New Potatoes A Few Minutes Later  But By This Time I Had Nearly Finished My Steak And Salad I Appreciate That This Is All That Could Be Done  But It Spoilt Our Meal For Both Of Us.  It Was A Special Occasion And The First Time We Had Been On Holiday  And Child-Free Since Our Triplets Were Born Over Three Years Ago However Everyone Was Extremely Apologetic Other Than This  The Food Was Excellent  And Everyone Worked Hard To Ensure We Were Happy,,,,,
,5170,Very Unique. Great Service. Excellent Rooms. Pleasant Surroundings,,,,,
,5171,Enjoyed The General Ambiance,,,,,
,5172,A Perfect Weekend To Celebrate My Birthday. All Staff Were Really Helpful And Pleasant  And Made All Of Us Feel Very Welcome And At Ease,,,,,
,5174,Very Relaxing In Opulent Surroundings.,,,,,
,5175,It Is A Really Lovely Place To Sta With Great Staff And Facilities.  The Décor Is Tired  And Needs Some Refurbishing  The Bathroom In Particular Could Do With A New Bath Panel And There Is Damage Under The Splashback On The Washbasin Where Water Has Leaked In.  I Used The Swimming Pool And  Steam Room Early On Saturday Evening And There Were Wet Towels Everywhere And The Floors Were Wet And Dirty  There Had Obviously Been A Lot Of People Using The Facilities And Not Enough Staff To Tidy Up After Them.,,,,,
,5176,Came To Celebrate My Husband's 65Th Birthday. Staff Very Attentive  Great Service And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. We Feel They Genuinely Wanted To Make Our Stay A Memorable One. Really Relaxing And Felt Like We Had Gone Back In Time. The Reception Rooms Were Well Maintained And Inviting. The Bedroom Was Comfortable And Nice And Warm. Cosmetically Some Areas Were In Need Of Some Attention  But This Is A Minor Detail. Swimming Pool And Leisure Facilities Modern And Well Maintained. The Grounds Were Beautiful  Despite The Wind And Rain. The Food Was Of Good Standard  Although Given The Price  We Were More Impressed With Gidleigh Park  Which Is Where We Celebrated My Husbands Birthday Last Year. Overall  However  Thoroughly Enjoyable With No Complaints  Would Recommend It To Friends And Family.,,,,,
,5177,An Excellent Experience With Outstanding Food  We Always Travel With Our Dogs And We Were All Made To Feel Extremely Welcome.,,,,,
,5178,Relaxed Need I Say Any More,,,,,
,5179,Comfortable In A Beautiful Hotel Building And Setting,,,,,
,5180,Great Venue  Food Good...Over Attentive Staff In Breakfast On Saturday ....My 20 Something Daughter Was Overwhelmed By The Attention...On Sunday  At 10.15 Am Not Enough Staff And Had To Wait 40 Minutes For Breakfast....Very Hot In Main Hotel.....Bistro Cooler ...We Slept With Windows Wide Open Unheard Off At Home...Pool And Gym Facilities Great..But The Unsupervised Nature Meant 6 Teenagers Spoilt The Tranquility For Numerous Adults Saturday Afternoon.....,,,,,
,5181,Very Pleasantly Surprised By The Sincerity And Friendliness Of Your Staff. Excellent Food Very Comfortable A Real Treat.,,,,,
,5182,Relaxing And Welcoming ,,,,,
,5183,A Great Place To Spend A Few Days In The Winter,,,,,
,5184,We Stayed At Bovey 6 Years Ago And Had A Brilliant Time. We Have Been Trying To Book To Come Back Ever Since. We Had A Great Room Again But Elements Of Our Stay Disappointed. The One Night Stay Is Never Enough! Having Been Called To See If There Were Any Extras To Add To Our Stay I Had Wanted To Book A Treatment. I Called Saturday But There Was No Answer. I Left A Message. No Treatments Were Free When We Arrived. We Ate A Cream Tea In The Corridor! Based On Our Dinner Bed Breakfast Rate There Was Little Option For The Table Booking Time In The Evening And Ended Up Not Eating Until After 9Pm. We Had A Pre Dinner Drink In The Bar  Food Was In The Bistro. It Would Be Useful If The Bar Staff Explained That Guests Eating In The Bistro Should Make Their Own Way To The Restaurant  Having Checked Our Table Booking We Sat For 20Mins Expecting To Be Told Our Table Was Ready But Eventually Told Just To Make Our Own Way. Overall Good But Not Excellent. High Expectations After Our Last Stay. ,,,,,
,5185,A Wonderful Stay In A  Beautiful Building With A Relaxed And Friendly Atmosphere.  The Staff Were Extremely Helpful  Polite And Friendly Which Added To The Wonderful Break.,,,,,
,5186,Very Nice Stay  Lovely Setting And Good Service At The Lodges. Service At Main Castle Was A Bit Up Tight Though  Didn't Make Us Feel Welcome...,,,,,
,5188,Service Exceptional.  Staff Attentive And Polite At All Times. Wonderful Surroundings And Hotel. Spa And Golf Enjoyed By Us All. ,,,,,
,5190,As Usual A Beautiful Experience And The Staff Were Fantastic!,,,,,
,5191,A Very Nice And Enjoyable Weekend.,,,,,
,5193,Pleasant  But Overpriced.,,,,,
,5194,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,5197,Relaxed And Friendly Atmosphere,,,,,
,5198,Unwinding Amazing !,,,,,
,5199,The Reception Staff Are Great As Are Those In The Spa  The Restaurant Staff Could Not Translate My English Into What I Wanted To Eat.  The Doors In The Bedroom And Around The Building Had Dirty Handprints On Them.  We Asked For A Quiet Room And A Family With A Baby Were Put In The Room Next Door. As For The "Opt Out" Service Charge For Everything Including Booking The Room It Became Too Much Especially When The Service Was Poor,,,,,
,5201,A Super Weekend  Relaxing With Comfy Tasteful Rooms In The Lodge  It Is Like Taking A Step Back To A Nicer More Polite Age ,,,,,
,5202,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,5203,Exceeded Expectations. I Had Thought I Had Had A Relaxing Weekend Away Before  But I Never Relealised What I Had Been Missing,,,,,
,5204,Lived Up To Expectations. As Soon As One Turns Into The Drive One Has The Same Warm And Cosy Feeling As Turning Into One's Own Home. It Is The Perfect Place To Relax And Unwind. We Will Return.,,,,,
,5205,"Jaw Dropping"!!! Fabulous Welcome And Customer Service  Fabulous Food In The Edwardian Restaurant  Fabulous Massage In The Spa ,,,,,
,5207,Extremely Pleasant.,,,,,
,5208,Absolutely Fantastic. My Fiancée Had A Brilliant Birthday Break. The Staff Were It Of This World. We Would Love To Go Back. Thank You So Much! ,,,,,
,5209,A Relaxing And Utterly Pleasurable Treat.,,,,,
,5210,A Wonderful Winter Weekend Being Spoilt By The Staff,,,,,
,5211,Pleasant But Bedroom And Housekeeping Poor.In A Very Empty Hotel They Put Us In The Room Next To The Boiler -Rm 11.We Asked To Move And Got Room 8. It Was Quiet With A Lovely View But The Bathroom Was Tiny A Large Crack In The Sink And A Bath With The Enamel Missing In Some Places.The Room Decor Needs Work With Marks And Stains On The Wall. The Fridge Did Not Work And Had To Be Replaced And Milk Had To Be Requested.On Our Second Day No Fresh Milk Was Supplied And The Waste Bin Was Not Emptied. My Husband And I Have Travelled Extensively And We Were Disappointed By The Standard Of Our Room. The Staff Were Friendly And Helpful And Food Good.It Is The Detail That Makes A First Rate Hotel Experience And It Was Lacking Here. Why Put A Couple Next To The Boiler Room When The Hotel Was Empty? We Were Also Disappointed That Immediately On Giving Our Names To Reception On Check In They Informed Us Of A Special Offer For £40 A Night We Could Have A Better Room. Better Pr Would Have Been To Offer This For Free!,,,,,
,5212,Relaxing Break Away From Our Children. Pampered!,,,,,
,5213,Fabulous. Exceeded Expectations. Great Little Details Such As Car Parking And Taking Luggage On Arrival  Great Outfits Worn By Employees. Also Brilliant Activities  Suitable For Everyone. Food In Bistro Was Very Good. ,,,,,
,5214,It Met My Expectations And Was A Lovely Stay. One Little Point To Mention Is That You Do Not Stock Decaffeinated Tea Bags In Your Rooms. Although You Tried Your Best To Sort This Out It Took Three Trips To Our Room And Two Phone Calls. The First Was Phone Call To Say You Only Had Loose Tea. Then Tea Arrived And Tea Strainer (Difficult To Use Without A Pot). Then Waitress Came Back To Charge Me For The Privilege (Signed Bill)  So Asked For A Teapot. Then Phone Call To Say No Charge Would Be Levied. Finally Tea Pot Arrived. This All Took About Half An Hour For A Simple Cup Of Tea. ,,,,,
,5215,Felt  That I Had Died And Gone To Heaven. The Staff Were So Welcoming Of Me And My Two Children( 9 And 6 Years). Although Expensive There Was No Sense Of 'Stuffiness' About The Place Or The Staff.  ,,,,,
,5216,Very Pleasant Stay  Staff Very Attentive  It Was Given As A Present For My 60Th Birthday From My Son. We Probably Couldnt Afford It In Peak Times. We Can Throught Secret Escapes Offer.,,,,,
,5219,We Loved It.  The Only Minor Criticism Is The Pervasive Piped Music In The Public Rooms.,,,,,
,5220,Very Pleasant Stay  Every Member Of Staff Worked Hard To Make It An Enjoyable Stay. ,,,,,
,5221,Luxurious; Wonderfully Attentive Food; Fantastic Breakfast; Beautiful Setting,,,,,
,5222,Nice Place But Felt Ripped Off By Service Charges That Are Automaticallly Added To Bill. Felt It Qas All A Bit Artificial. ..It May Convince Americans And Asians Tgat It Is Typically British But Not The Brits! Felt Too Much Like A Money Machine Than True Hospitality.,,,,,
,5223,Loved The Place And Relaxed Feeling And Excellent Staff.  However I Felt The Evening Meal (Described As Gourmet) Was Definely Below What I Expected And Was On A Par With Moderate Pub Fare.,,,,,
,5224,Attention To Detail Is Impressive. Believe It Or Not It Was The Supply Of Dog Towels In The Front Porch Which Set The Scene For Me - I Knew That There Would Be Other Little Touches Which Would Delight.,,,,,
,5225,Relaxing Enjoyable Stay. Excellent Manager & Staff/Great Service,,,,,
,5226,Very Comfortable With Excellent Staff.,,,,,
,5227,Very Luxurious  Lovely Surroundings And Super Staff,,,,,
,5228,Lovely Although Expensive ,,,,,
,5229,A Lovely Relaxing Luxurious Escape,,,,,
,5231,Very Well Looked After By All Staff,,,,,
,5232,A Wonderful Place For Our 43Rd Wedding Anniversary,,,,,
,5233,Lovely Location With Attentive Staff With An Elegant But Relaxed Atmosphere,,,,,
,5234,We Thought It Was A Wonderful Place And The Staff All Very Welcoming. The Food In The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent. Overall We Left Very Relaxed.,,,,,
,5235,Everything That We Wanted It To Be And More. A True Break And An Escape From Our Daily Lives.,,,,,
,5236,Beautiful Place  Upbeat  Excellent Service - Best Service Of Any Stay We Have Had  This Time. Thank You.,,,,,
,5239,The Most Relaxing Break Ever Had.  Stunning Views . Staff Attentive (And Fun Also). Wonderful Food.,,,,,
,5240,Beautiful Hotel In Amazing Surroundings. Excellent Staff. Wonderful Log Fires!,,,,,
,5241,Fantastic! Real Understated Luxury With Excellent And Very Friendly Staff. Superb Location ,,,,,
,5242,Amazing,,,,,
,5243,Peacefull And Relaxing,,,,,
,5244,Unforgettable.,,,,,
,5245,So Often Hotels Disappoint In Some Way.  Not On This Occasion.  The Hotel Building And Grounds  Staff  Food And All Round Experience Were Exceptional. Lovely Atmosphere And Furnishings. We Were Lucky With The Weather (Esp For Jan) And Able To Take Advantage Of The Lovely Walks Suggested In The Hotel Booklet. I Want To Come Back. ,,,,,
,5246,Fabulous Attention To Detail  Extremely Professional.    Elegant And Welcoming.    Pool Area Terrific  Staff Couldn't Be Nicer Or More Helpful.,,,,,
,5248,Delightful.,,,,,
,5249,Relaxing  Enjoyable And Left Wanting To Stay Longer!,,,,,
,5250,We Were Delighted With Every Aspect Of Our Stay. The Professionalism And Friendliness Of The Staff Made This Short Break An Especially Pleasant Experience.,,,,,
,5251,Had A Fantastic Time! Staff We're Very Helpful And Friendly. Food Was Excellent. ,,,,,
,5252,A Haven To Return To After Busy Days  Wonderful Setting And Fantastic Food.  Staff Were Attentive And Helpful.,,,,,
,5257,Great Service And Very Friendly  Beautiful Location With Amazing Architecture. Enjoyed The Service  Food And Taking All The Character And Charm Of The Building. Would Of Loved To Have Seen More Of The Outside And Walks But The Weather Was Awful Which Is No Fault Of Yours. ,,,,,
,5258,Nice Experience   Relaxing Exactly What We Were Looking For......But Just Too Short!,,,,,
,5259,It's A Superb Place - Breathtaking Scenery  Lovely Rooms And A 5 Start Service,,,,,
,5260,From Driving Up To Main Door To Leaving Was Made To Feel Very Welcome,,,,,
,5266,A Wonderful Experience.We Have Not Stayed In An Hotel Before Where The Staff Gave Their Clients As Much Care And Attention. When Something Did Go Wrong It Was Noted Seriously. The Main Dining Room Experience Was Amazing.Thank You For A Delightful Few Days.,,,,,
,5267,Calm Comfortable,,,,,
,5268,Positive And Enjoyable And The Afternoon Tea Was Very Good Indeed. Given The Cost Of Our Stay I Would Have Expected Small Details Not To Be Overlooked Though. For Example  I Was Asked If I Wanted A Morning Paper  But This Did Not Arrive On Either Morning; One Of  The Small Jam Pots On Our Breakfast Table Was Clearly Used And  Half Empty. The Hall Carpet On The First Floor Was Very Stretched And Rather Sorry Looking And The Shower Rooms In The Pool Had Mould All Around The Bottom Join With The Floor. In All The Stay Was Great  But I Did Not Leave Thinking 'I Must Return'. At Over _700 For Two Nights In January (Arguable Not The Busiest Time Of Year) I Would Have Expected A Bit More (Complimentary This Or That) An Amuse Bouche At Supper  And The Paper,,,,,
,5269,We Have Stayed Several Times And Love The Relaxed Atmosphere And Beautifully Furnished Rooms And Drawing Rooms. Pool Is Fantastic And One Of The Best We Have Seen. Staff Very Helpful And Friendly. ,,,,,
,5270,Very Enjoyable.  We Were Able To Relax In Lovely Surroundings Withexcellent Service.,,,,,
,5271,Excellent Friendly And Efficient Service. We Were Made Very Welcome And Comfortable. ,,,,,
,5279,Truly Amazing. The Staff Are Lovely  The Food Wonderful And The Spa Really Relaxing.,,,,,
,5280,It Was Great To Come Away Feeling The Hotel Lived Up To Its Billing. We Have Been 3 Times In The Last 3 Years And Have Left Feeling Totally Disheartened Even Having To Make Formal Complaints On 2 Occasions. This Was A Lovely Break And How It Should Be. You Also Had A Management Trainee At The Hotel Who Was Superb 'Paul' .. Made Our Stay Even Better.,,,,,
,5281,The Place Was Spectacular  The Surroundings Sublime.  The First Day I Arrived With A Party Of 10 It Seemed That We Were Not Expected.  I Had Set Up The Event With Dani In Events  But She Hadn't Suggested That I Book Tea Or Lunch When We Arrived And When We Came In Hungry After The Long Journey From London It Seemed That We Were An Inconvenience To The Staff. 
Service Was A Bit Slow The First Day As Well  But For The Most Part  Staff Was Very Kind And Helpful.
Service On Sunday Was Much Better.
It Was Also Great That Dani Could Arrange The Murder Mystery Dinner Although It Was All Too Much Of A Mystery To Me How It Would Proceed.,,,,,
,5282,Meet And Greet/Front Of House..Faultless. Lounge Areas..Pleasant And Relaxing. Bedrooms..Tired And Dated (Room 38) Fine Dining Restaurant... Very Poor Quility For Price Charged. Eating Off Floor Tiles Is Not Fine Dining! And Far Too Many Eastern Europeans Busying Themselves Around The Table. If We Visit Again I'll Fetch A Packed Lunch!,,,,,
,5283,Superb  Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay,,,,,
,5284,Extremely Enjoyable. The Staff Were All Most Helpful.,,,,,
,5285,The Castle Is Beautiful  Comfortable And Has A Very Welcoming And Relaxing Atmosphere. 
The Staff Were Very Friendly But Service Was Extremely Slow On Food & Beverages Throughout Our Stay. 
The Value For Money Was Good And I Would Definitely Come Back With The Hope That The Service Level Improves And Meets The Expectation Of Such A Premium Location. ,,,,,
,5286,Just Perfect From Start To Finish,,,,,
,5287,Brilliant But Did Take Offence At Being Turned Away From Lounge Bar Because Tables Had Been Reserved,,,,,
,5288,Luxurious And Relaxing. Very Pleasant. ,,,,,
,5289,Comfortable.
Difficulty (Impossible) On Sunday Pm To Get A Seat In Lounge Because You Had Maximised Your Sunday Afternoon Tea Bookings  You Cannot Forget Guests.
Understand Your 12.5% Service Charge And Your Explanation For It  But Not Fully Accept - Wish I Could Uplift My Clients Prices By Such A % And Get Away With It. You Are Taking The Michael And Preying On People's Reluctance At Check Out To Say No - Be Honest With Your Prices. The Surcharge Is The Principle Reason I Would Not Return Or Recommend.,,,,,
,5290,A Lovely Place And Cant Wait To Visit Again,,,,,
,5292,Absolutely Fantastic,,,,,
,5294,Great,,,,,
,5295,Staff Were Excellent - Shame It Took So Long To Sort Our Rooms And Promise Of Champagne Did Not Materialise.,,,,,
,5296,A Fantastic Experience Excellent Food Location And Staff ,,,,,
,5297,We Had A Fabulous Weekend At Bovey Castle  We Were Thoroughly Looked After  Especially By Ashley  She Is A Credit To Your Hotel   We Have Recommended It To Many Of Our Family  Friends & Colleagues. Can't Wait To Come Back Again In The Future.,,,,,
,5298,Loved The Facilities And The Atmosphere. Cocktail Making Was Brilliant. Weather Could Have Been Kinder But That Meant We Used The Superb Swimming Pool. Only Criticism Is That Gym Is Not Situated Well And The Equipment Could Do With Updating.. Wonder Whether An Outside Activity Course For Adults Would Work? Bmf Etc Are Trendy Currently.,,,,,
,5299,Very Enjoyable But With Small Annoyances That Should Not Happen In A5* Hotel,,,,,
,5301,The Service Throughout All Areas Of The Hotel Was Outstanding ; Personal Yet Professional. The Hotel Is Comfortable And Classy Without Being "Wag-Ish" Or Too Stylised.,,,,,
,5302,Very Relaxing  With Wonderful Attentive Staff. Amazing Facilities  Superb Food. Frederico Welcomed Us Immediately And Was Utterly Charming For The Whole Of Our Stay! ,,,,,
,5303,From The Moment We Arrived The Service Of The Staff Was Excellent.  They Are An Exceptional Team Of Warm And Considerate Men And Women.  The Facilities Were Equally Superb And Of The Highest Standard.  In Many Places Around The World That We've Visited We've Left Thinking "Why Didn't They ...?"  Here  There Was Nothing Which We Could Think Of That Could Improve On The Experience.  Of Course  Things Might Be A Little Different At The Height Of The Season  But We Doubt That There Would Be Any Lessening Of Standards In The Personal Care Of All The Guests.,,,,,
,5304,Relaxed And Stylish ,,,,,
,5305,Warm Country Hotel With A Lovely Atmosphere And Excellent Attentive But Not Intrusive Staff.,,,,,
,5306,Excellent !!!! From When We Arrived To When We Left We Were Made To Feel Special By Every Member Of Staff.
The Surroundings Were Beautiful And The Service First Class.,,,,,
,5307,The Lodges Were Spacious And The Hotel Had A Nice Relaxed Feel - Staff Were Friendly  But Not Too Friendly.
Swimming Pool Was Great And The Location Is Great For Exploring Dartmoor.,,,,,
,5308,Absolutely Brilliant  Loved Every Minute And Wish I Could Have Stayed Longer,,,,,
,5316,It Was A Different World Compared To Other Hotels  The Staff Were Excellent And Nothing Was To Much Trouble.,,,,,
,5317,Absolutely Delightful !! A Real Treat!! Staff All Very Attentive And Service Was Excellent.,,,,,
,5318,It's Like Being A Member Of A Lovely Country Club With A Fabulous Spa.  There Is Only One Thing I Would Change And That Would Be To Have A Hot Jacuzzi.  We Come To Bovey Castle Usually Once A Month Because It's Like Home From Home.  It Is The Best Place To Take Your Dog As All Of The Staff Are So Welcoming - Absolutely Brilliant. ,,,,,
,5319,Great Welcome; Lovely Friendly & Helpful Staff; Unintrusive & Great Service.,,,,,
,5320,Had A Great Time With Lovely Food And Great Activities Going On.,,,,,
,5322,Very Good And The Decoration Is Quite Unique. It Is Magnificent Area.  
I Would Expect More Outdoor Activities To Be Organized For Smaller Groups. ,,,,,
,5323,Enjoyable Weekend But First Night Ruined By Members Party Directly Below Our Room Which Kept Us Awake Until After Midnight. Food And Service In The Bistro Were Very Average But The Second Evening We Ate In The Edwardian Restaurant And Food And Service Was Great.  ,,,,,
,5325,Marvellous Friendly Staff At A Beautiful Location. Delicious Food Although The Steak Was Not As Good As Elsewhere. Lovely Room. Excellent Pool And Sauna. Very Relaxed Atmosphere. Thoroughly Enjoyed Every Moment.,,,,,
,5326,Relaxing  Though There Was A Smell Of Drains In The Living Room Of Rose Cottage  Which I Reported To Reception And Was Told Someone From House Keeping Would Come And Check  But No One Did. The Staff Could Be Friendlier  They Made Us Feel Like We Shouldn't Be There When Entering The Main Building To Use The Pool. There Was A Summer Weight Duvet On The Bed In January And The Central Heating Is Poor.,,,,,
,5327,A Very Friendly Welcoming Hotel In A Fantastic Setting - The Stay Was Very Relaxing And Enjoyable ,,,,,
,5328,Excellent Staff  Could Not Be More Helpful Kind And Welcoming  From The Manager Right Down To The Lovely Gents Opening The Doors. Facilities Brilliant  In Particular The "Extra" Ferret/Falconry Mornings. Spotlessly Clean  Grounds Immaculate (Even After The Storms The Grounds Men Were Busy Collecting Fallen Twigs The Very Next Day). Perfect Mix Of Traditional English Stiff Upper Lip Luxury And Welcoming Attitude From All.,,,,,
,5329,A Very Special Weekend!,,,,,
,5330,Beautiful House With Mixture Of Luxury And Homeliness Which Is Almost Unique. Very Good Service.,,,,,
,5333,We Felt Very Special And Well Looked After  The Level Of Customer Service Was Amazing. The Little Touches Such As The Turning Down The Bed And Leaving Some Fudge With The Weather Forecast On The Bed Were Rally Nice. The Only Thing That Didn't Live Up To The Rest Was The Evening Meal In The Edwardian Grill  The Steak Was Over Cooked  The Red Wine Was Too Cold And My Food Allergy Was Not Dealt With Very Well.,,,,,
,5334,Love It ;-) ,,,,,
,5335,Memorable  Relaxing  Retreat.  Derrick Was Very Professional With Nothing Too Much Trouble.  He Made Us Feel Welcome From The Moment We Arrived And Is A Real Asset To Bovey Castle.  Our Room 26 Was Warm And A Nice Size.  We Wish You And Your Team Well Deserved Success To The Future And Hope To Visit Again Soon.  Jason And Lizette Baker,,,,,
,5336,Lovely Warm Atmosphere  Great Location  Homey & Inviting  Great Service Barring 1 Incident Of Understaffing / Inattentive Service (Fed Back At Check Out),,,,,
,5337,Relaxing  Quiet  Refreshing,,,,,
,5338,Friendly  Helpful  Accommodating  Extensive Provision.,,,,,
,5339,Great Venue  Fantastic Service!,,,,,
,5340,It Was A Really Lovely Treat To Stay With You For Our Anniversary Although Not Something We Would Ordinarily Have Been Able To Afford If It Were Not For The Travel Zoo Special Offer.  You Have An Amazing Venue  With Great Service  And We Truly Felt Comfortable And Relaxed So Overall The Expereince Was Great.  It Was Unfortunate That There Was A Power Cut On The Evening Of Our Stay Which Meant We Woke Up With No Power Or Electricity In Our Room  So We Had To Shower In The Dark And Were Unable To Use The Kettle Or Hair Dryer Which Was A Little Disappointing.  We Did Not Let This Ruin Our Trip But Were A Little Upset By The Maintenance Man's Communication When He Came To Our Room And (With No Apology Or Care That We Had Been Without Power All Morning) Felt Accusing By Telling Us It Was Our Room (Room 54) Which Had Tripped The Rest Of The Electrics On The 3Rd Floor And Questioning Us With What Had We Plugged In - Which Was Nothing Other Than The Hotel Equipment (Hair Dryer And Kettle The Evening Before).,,,,,
,5341,Pleasant.  Although The £75 Charge For A Late Check Out Was Rather Extortionate!,,,,,
,5342,The Staff Are Fantastic! Frederico  You're Amazing. Never Before Has A Hotel Manager Been So Interactive With Guests  Rather Than Hiding Away In An Office Never To Be Seen. What A Refreshing Change. We Loved The Hotel And Will Come Again. One Tiny Piece Of Feedback: The Shower Gel Pumps In The Swimming Pool Changing Rooms Are Screwed Into The Wall Very High Up. I Could Barely Reach Them. Please Can They Be Lowered?,,,,,
,5343,Fantastic Hotel And Service,,,,,
,5344,Very Good Experience  We Really Enjoyed Our Stay And Look Forward To Returning.,,,,,
,5345,All The Facilities Are Excellent  As Are The Staff And The Attention To Detail. Perfect!,,,,,
,5346,Fabulous ,,,,,
,5347,Very Relaxing And Hospitable. Excellent Service  Just Wish We Had More Time With You,,,,,
,5349,It Makes You Feel Relaxed!,,,,,
,5350,The Property Is Stunning And Every Element Of The Service Front He Moment We Arrived Until The Moment We Left Was Absolutely Excellent.  There Are A Few Tired Areas Such As The Bathrooms And Spa Area Which Could Do With Updating.  The Spa Area Particularly Is Not Very Welcoming With Minimal Beds To Relax On.  Strangely There Are Tables And Chairs And A Garden Bench Which Do Not Seen To Add To The Experience  I Would Get Rid Of Those And Add More Beds. ,,,,,
,5351,Fantastico!,,,,,
,5352,Lovely,,,,,
,5353,The Attentive Bovey Castle Staff Absolutely Made Our 30Th Wedding Anniversary Celbrations Perfect. Outstanding & Professional Service Coupled With The Superb Bovey Castle Brand Set In Beautiful Devon Countryside. A Wonderful & Winning Combination.,,,,,
,5354,Excellent Personal Service. Fabulous Facilities. 
Enjoyed The Spa. Great Menu Choices And Food Was Beautiful. ,,,,,
,5355,Everything Was Beautiful About The Hotel And Surrounding Countryside.  The Staff Were Excellent And Couldn't Do Enough For Us.,,,,,
,5356,Completely Relaxing In A Sumptuous Yet Homely Environment.,,,,,
,5357,Unfortunately We Arrived Very Late Due To Poor Weather/Road Conditions.  We Received A Very Warm Welcome From The Staff And Although The Kitchen Was Closed A Very Tasty Sandwich Was Made For Us.  The Next Day We Were Offered A Complementary Lunch/Drinks As We Missed The Inclusive Dinner The Night Before.  This Was Very Kind Although We Were Unable To Take Up This Offer As We Had An Engagement To Get To.   We Will Definitely Come Back So We Can Fully Enjoy The Facilities And Warm Welcome.  Thank You.  Cliff Davies.  ,,,,,
,5358,From The Time We Arrived  We Were Made To Feel Special And That Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.The Staff Were All Very Courteous And Our Accommodation Was Superbly Comfortable And Complete.,,,,,
,5361,Perfect In Every Way. The Service Received Is Of The Highest Standards And The Staff Are Attentive To The Customers Needs. 
It Is The Destination Of  Choice. ,,,,,
,5362,Service Excellent  Food Very Good  Room Very Nice But Due To Bad Weather ( Which Obviously Could Not Be Helped)  Middle Window Rattled Badly  Room Also Close To Noisy Extractor Fan. Would Love To Visit Again In Better Weather But Would Request Room Away From Fan. ,,,,,
,5363,We Werevewry  Well Looked After Which Enabled Us To Relax After Our Very Harrowing Journey Through The Floods,,,,,
,5364,Relaxing  Comfortable  Welcoming  Luxurious,,,,,
,5365,It Was Only Short So I Did Not Experience All The Facilities,,,,,
,5366,Very Good,,,,,
,5367,Simply Great!,,,,,
,5369,Lusciously Luxurious. Absolute Pleasure To Stay And Eat. ,,,,,
,5370,We Have Stayed A Number Of Times And I'm Very Happy With The Lodges And Friendly Staff. My Daughter Was Very Ill During The Stay So I Could Nt Use All The Facilities As I Would Have Liked And The Weather Was Awful. Great Food - We Will Come Again X
,,,,,
,5371,You Could Not Fault The Staff (Excellent).The Mackerel Starter In The Edwardian Restaurant Was Very Very Disappointing You Could Not Taste The Mackerel Only The Crab.When We Tried To Book A Treatment In The Spa We Were Told That They Where Fully Booked This Week (Half Term) Through Outside Guests Booking Up.What About The Hotel Guests.,,,,,
,5372,I Couldn't Fault The Stay Or Staff With Anything  Everyone Went Out If Their Way To Ensure A Stay Was Perfect.,,,,,
,5373,Could Not Be Better. Just Happy That A Kind Of This Place Excist.,,,,,
,5374,The Hotel Is Lovely  The Spa Treatment Was Excellent And The Swimming Pool Is Excellent. The Castle Bistrol Was Perfectly Adequate As Part Of The Spa Deal  But The Evening Meal In The Castle Bistro As Part Of Our Overnight Stay Was A Complete Disappointment And Rather Spoiled The Visit. The Bistro Seemed Quite Incongruous With The Rest Of The Hotel  And It Certainly Wasn't A Very Nice Meal  Spoiling An Otherwise Enjoyable Visit (Despite The Weather).,,,,,
,5375,We Loved Our Stay Just Spoilt By How Hot Our Room Was. All Windows Open And Radiators Off But Still Too Hot. ,,,,,
,5376,We Found The Staff Attentive But Not Obtrusive   Very Professional And Helpful   The Food Was Delicious And Our Room Was Really Good.All In All A Fabulous Experience,,,,,
,5377,Perfect  If I Had One Complaint  We Found The Restaurant Menu A Little Limited ,,,,,
,5378,Met Our Expectations And Beyond. The Service Was Second To None And Will Definitely Be Coming Back For Another Mini-Break.,,,,,
,5379,Lovely,,,,,
,5380,Great Hotel. Very Relaxed And Informal. Very Friendly And Welcoming Staff.,,,,,
,5381,Absolutely Amazing  We Could Not Have Asked For More.,,,,,
,5382,Everything Was Perfect. ,,,,,
,5383,In Spite Of Awful Weather We Were Busy Every Moment Of The Stay Either Being Pampered By Luxury  Or Swimming Hard In The Pool Or Watching In Awe At The Falconry Display. It Was The Most Amazing 24 Hours..In Fact Felt Like 48!! ,,,,,
,5384,Really Nice Stay But We Won't Be Able To Afford To Stay Again Unfortunat,,,,,
,5385,Poor Value For Money,,,,,
,5386,Good - But Not Perfect,,,,,
,5387,It Was A Privilege To Be Able To Stay In Such A Majestic And Fabulous Building.  I Admire And Respect Greatly People That Dedicate Their Time And Money Into Keeping Our Architectural Heritage Alive.  I Thoroughly Enjoyed The Visit  It Was Comfortable  Restful And So So Relaxing.,,,,,
,5388,Wonderfully Comfortable. Best Possible Staff. Our Bathroom Needed Attention. Cracked Tile Chipped Bath Signs Of Having Moved The Shower. Pizza In The Bistro Needed Garlic And Herbs.,,,,,
,5389,The Overall Experience Was Very Good And The Staff Were Extremly Helpful As One Would Expect.
We Did Have An Issue With The Original Room That Was Set Aside For Us  But That Was Overcome When We Raised The Problem With Reception. The House Manager And Hotel Manager Were Both Very Helpful In Sorting Out Our Concerns And Bringing The Situation To A Satisfactory Conclusion.
The Problem With The Room (29) Was The Noise From The Kitchen Fans  There Was A Constant Drone From The Ventilation Unit And Although I Was Inform That This Would Stop After Service (10.00)    We However Had Come Away From A Busy Week And Just Wanted To Relax In The Calm Quiet Surrounding Of Bovey Castle  To Sit And Read  Which Was Not We Felt Possible With The Droneing Noise.
My Company Build Bespoke Houses For Demanding And People Who Pay Great Attension To Detail And There Are Baffles And Mountings That Can Be Fitted To Ventilation Units To Prevent The Rumble And Noise We Experienced  Which I Am Sure Would Benefit Your Clients Who Are In Rooms In The Vacinity Of The Kitchens.
Once We Were Moved It Was Very Good,,,,,
,5391,We Had A Great Few Days  Quality Time For Us And Our Children.  We Swimming Pool Is Perfect And Nice And Warm! We Also Enjoyed Our Walk Around The Grounds And The Crazy Golf.  The Staff Are Very Welcoming And Very Attentive And The Breakfast Had So Much Choice - A Fine Dining Experience In Itself.  Our Children Loved Beaky And The Lego Room Service Was A Big Hit Also.,,,,,
,5392,Well Managed Hotel. Friendly Courteous Helpful Staff .  Superb Location   We Hope For Better Weather On Our Next Visit!.,,,,,
,5393,First Class.,,,,,
,5394,First Class.,,,,,
,5395,Very Enjoyable Made Wellcome As Soon As We Arrived In Carpark To Leaving Via Carpark,,,,,
,5396,Federico Is An Asset To Bovey However I'm Beginning To Feel That Other Staff Do Not Follow His Example. Why Is It That When We Have Visited On Numerous Occasions And Got Married Here We Still Get 'Do You Want To Be Shown Around ' ? This Is A Nice Touch But Repeat Custom Is Not Recognised  We Spent The Previous Two Nights At Salcombe Southsands Where A Glass Of Prosecco Is Given To Returning Guests ( I Remember When This Was The Case When You Checked In At  Bovey ). We Waited In The Bar For 20 Mins Before The Bar Man Spoke To Us ( Whilst Waiting For Our Room )  Then After Two Hours I Had To Go To The Bar To Request The Bill. We Love This Hotel But Things Have Changed For The Worse   Maybe We Have Been Spoiled Staying At Ritz Carltons And Fairmonts All Over The World But I Thought Bovey Casle Would Want To Be Up There With The Best Of Them.,,,,,
,5397,Edwardian Solice,,,,,
,5398,Very Helpful Staff  Nothing Is To Much Trouble.
Relaxing Place To Stay What Ever The Wheather,,,,,
,5399,Lovely Location With First Class Staff.  Overall  A Short But Amazing Experience That Re-Charged Our Batteries (Required For The Drive Home Through Deep Flood Water!),,,,,
,5400,A Beautiful Resort  But Quite Expensive,,,,,
,5401,Fantastic  Price Reflects The Service  Standard.,,,,,
,5402,Loved The Place. The Dinner On The First Night Let You Down And Spoilt The Experience. Meal Not Up To Scratch. Lukewarm. Menu Not Up To The Standard Of The Hotel. Pudding Inedible And Cooked To Be So Hard I Could Not Put My Fork In It. No Falconry Although It Is Stated It Is On Daily.
Lunch The Next Day Much Better And Spa Treatment Vey Good.,,,,,
,5403,Everything We Had Hoped For,,,,,
,5404,It Was What We Were Looking For - Two Nights Away In A Country Leisure Retreat With Access To Walking /Dartmoor.  Service Was Excellent And We Particularly Appreciated The Hotel Balance Of Quality Service And Accomodation Of The Outdoor Lifestyle (Dog Towels And Wellies In Porch A Nice Touch),,,,,
,5405,We Were Very Well Taken Care Of From The Moment We Arrived. The Staff Were Polite And Helpful  And The Management Totally Professional. Thank You For The Lovely Upgrade And The Complimentary Glass Of Champagne   It Was Most Appreciated.  ,,,,,
,5406,This Is A Dream Holiday Destination. We Are So Pleased That We Were Able To Stay Again. The Facilities Are Wonderful  And The Pool And Changing Rooms Are So Pleasant. The Grounds Are So Pleasant  Despite The Weather. It Is Wonderful Too That You Are So Dog Friendly As It Meant That We Could All Have A Wonderful Break With The Dog Too. ,,,,,
,5407,We Were Led To Believe It Was A 5* Hotel But Our Experience Was Not 5* - We Found The Room Shabby And In Need Of Redecoration And Felt It Was Over-Priced For What We Got. The Bar And Lounge Areas Were Very Nice But We Were Disappointed Overall,,,,,
,5408,Great British Winter Holiday Full Of Outdoor Activities.,,,,,
,5409,Truly Wonderful! Beautiful Surroundings  Great Food  Outstanding Staff! Highly Recommend It.  ,,,,,
,5410,Setting Is  Obviously  Superb. Staff Without Exception Were Polite  Pleasant And Attentive. Room (Lack Of View) Was Something Of A Disappointment  As Was The 'Traditional English' Breakfast  But Overall An Enjoyable Stay.,,,,,
,5412,Fantastic Grounds And Facilities. Rooms Were Immaculate And Well Decorated. Service Was A Mixture Of Extreme Politeness And Helpfulness From Certain Members Of Staff And A Relaxed More Informal Approach From The Younger Waiters. The Food Choices Was Extremely Well Picked With A Suitable Variety But Not Overwhelming. Overall A Wonderful Experience.,,,,,
,5413,A Unique Experience  Made Up Of A Superb Setting  Excellent Facilities  Top Quality Service And A Genuine "Friendliness" Amongst Staff At All Levels,,,,,
,5414,Brilliant!,,,,,
,5415,We Had A Wonderful Time - Everything Was Excellent  The Food Was Particularly Exceptional  But All Aspects Of The Stay - Activities  Setting  Service  Etc Were Fabulous.,,,,,
,5416,Relaxing  Friendly And Serene. ,,,,,
,5417,As Per My Trip Advisor Report Being Published On Monday - An Excellent Visit  And We Thank Federico For Spending Time With Us In The Evening Explaining The Future Development Plans For Bovey Castle. ,,,,,
,5418,All Staff Very Helpful And Friendly. The Swimming Pool Was Excellent.,,,,,
,5419,Fantastic. Service Is Second To None And Room Was Brilliant. Our Free Upgrade To The Junior Suite Was Very Much Appreciated. I Would Say That £14 For A Pint Of Beer And An Orange Juice Was A Bit Overpriced Though! ,,,,,
,5420,I Booked A £229 One Night Package  A Few Days Before Arriving Someone From Bovey Castle Called My Husband And Upsold Him On Having Dinner In The Edwardian For An Extra Cost. I Think You Should Only Ever Call Up The Person Who Booked. The Room Was Good  Although Several Damp Patches On Wallpaper.  The Meal In The Edwardian Was Good But The Service Was Not  I Found The Waiter Rude On 3 Occasions  Although The Waitress Who Served Us Was Exemplary. The One Night Cost Us £300 Which I Did Not Think Was Value For Money. The Castle Itself Was Beautiful  In A Wonderful Setting And We Did Have Tea In One Of The Many Rooms  Which Was Very Nice And The Service There Was Also Good With A Waiter There Offering Me A Loan Of His Pen To Do My Crossword - That Was A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,5421,Brilliant  Lauren Especially Helped Make Our Stay Great,,,,,
,5422,Wonderful Weekend. Well Looked After And Was A Great Experience.,,,,,
,5423,Very Pleasant  Helpful Staff  Excellent Food And Wonderful Surroundings.,,,,,
,5424,Beautiful Location  Friendly Staff  Good Food In The Edwardian Bistro  Great Bird Of Prey Handler But Really Disappointed With Our Room  No 5.,,,,,
,5425,Perfect. Simply Amazing. Thank You For Having Us And Making Us Feel So Welcome. I Just Wish Mother Nature Had Not Tried To Kill Me So Many Times On The Way To See You! ;) ,,,,,
,5426,We Had A Fabulous Time  We Thought That The Room And Hotel Facilities Were First Class And The Staff Were Very Attentive Without Being Over The Top,,,,,
,5427,Simply Wonderful,,,,,
,5428,A Luxurious Treat,,,,,
,5429,Fantastic Time! Staff Were Brilliant  Food Is Amazing Even When The Weather Is Horrific. The Only Thing That Needs Work Is Decoration.,,,,,
,5430,Perfect,,,,,
,5431,A Really Relaxing Weekend In Fantastic Surroundings  Great Food And Drink  With Staff Who Couldn't Have Been More Helpful. We Will Definitely Be Coming Back!,,,,,
,5433,Trully Exceptional,,,,,
,5434,Luxury In The Countryside With A Opulent Feel  Perfect Staff Attitude And Approach And Very Welcoming.,,,,,

,9,While Booking I Emailed If Room Rate Could Be Disclosed From My Partner Because It Was A Present. This Was No Problem And It Wouldn't Be Stated On The Check In Form. I Also Payed In Advance But When Checking In It Was Stated On The Form For My Partner To See.,,,,,
,14,Staff Did Not Want To Show Us To Our Lodge As We Were With Helpful Holidays.  It Seemed Silly As There Were So Many People Working Behind The Front Desk  And No Guests In The Lobby,,,,,
,16,Super Efficient And Friendly Staff,,,,,
,22,The Arrival Team Were Friendly And Efficient,,,,,
,25,Small Piece Of Mis-Information Annoyed Me.  When I Asked Could We Have Sandwiches In The Bar I Was Told No. However When I Sat In The Bar I Asked The Bar Staff Who Said That Of Course I Could And Gave Me A Menu.,,,,,
,27,I Rang A Few Weeks Before Our Visit And Spoke To A Young Man About Arranging Quad Biking.  He Said He Would Call Me Back.  He Did Call Back To Say He Couldn't Get Hold Of The Quad People But He Would Keep Trying But He Never Called Me Again Which Is Not Good Customer Service.  In Any Case We Arranged The Quad Biking Ourselves At Half The Cost.,,,,,
,29,The Staff Were So Friendly With Big Smiles!  It Was Incredibly Helpful To Have The Tour Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,30,Excellent Fantastic Wekend Break In The Lodge,,,,,
,31,Very Impressed With All The Staff.Especially Touching When Asked If We Would Like A Car For Visiting Friends At Gidleigh Park - Very Efficient,,,,,
,32,Breakfast Was Poor For The Quality Of The Accommodation And One Morning Cooked Breakfast Was Not Offered Which I Think Is Unusual. We Were Phoned Several Times After The Stay To Make An Additional Payment; This Was Ok But I Was Put On Hold For 5Mins Then Told No One Was Available. Then Next Time I Phoned I Kept Getting Passed On To Different Members Of Staff. Staff Were Friendly And We Had A Fabulous Time  We Really Enjoyed The Building  Walks And Pool. We Would Love To Return In The Future  Thank You For Such A Lovely Relaxing Break.,,,,,
,34,If There Was One Thing I Would Point Out. On Arrival We Had Tea And Coffee And Would Have Like A Sandwich Or Cake. When We Asked We Were Only Offered Biscuits (Which Were Lovely)  But When We Seen The Afternoon Tea Menu Which We Had Booked It Said That Sandwiches Etc Were Available From 11Am To 5Pm. We May Have Been Misunderstood.  Otherwise Our Stay Was Exceptional. Thank You,,,,,
,43,Excellent,,,,,
,44,We Arrived At 6.Oopm Not Much Help Outside [Raining]  Staff On Arrival A Bit Confused,,,,,
,45,At Bovey For A One Night Stay- Check In At 3Pm Seemed Late As We Wanted To Unpack  Explore And Use Our Room To Get Changed And Use The Spa And Pool Facilities.,,,,,
,48,Efficient Check In.  Nice To Be Shown Around The Hotel On Arrival.,,,,,
,49,Lovely Welcome,,,,,
,50,Chap Who Parked The Car Was Smart And Professional,,,,,
,51,Room Promised For 3 Was Ready About 3.25,,,,,
,55,Minor- Booking Confirmation Was Not Emailed To Me  Despite Being Told It Would Be.,,,,,
,56,I Had A Problem With Original Room And Was Moved Twice. In The End Paid For An Upgrade Although Was Misquoted Upgrade Price By Reception. Rectified By Manager Next Day However If I Hadnt Checked It Would Have Been A Nasty Surprise. Room Was Lovely Though And Was Given A Very Good Discount.  Overall Staff Were Helpful If A Little Disorganised,,,,,
,58,A Warm And Friendly Greeting By All Staff,,,,,
,61,Email Contact Prior To Our Stay Was Prompt And Courteous.,,,,,
,64,The Reception Staff And Porters Were Charming And Welcoming. However We Found Some Of The Restaurant Staff To Have Limited Spoken English Which Was A Little Odd And The Turn Down Of Our Room Was Offered By A Rather Scary Chap  Who Was Rather Confrontational Than Friendly; We Declined His Offer.,,,,,
,67,How Wonderful To Have The Car Parked For Us And Thene Escoprted To Our Room.,,,,,
,70,Arrival Could Be Made Clearer For Lodges Maybe Give Clear Option Of Pre-Paid Luggage Transfer  Believe It Is |Â£20 Which I Would Have Prepaid And Then Be Straight Transfer Also Be Aware Of Service Charge So No Need To Tip,,,,,
,73,We Were A Little Early So Were Directed To One Of The Lounges Which Was Lovely But Even When We Returned When We Instructed To  There Seemed To Be Quite A Bit Of Confusion And We Had To Wait Nearly 30 Minutes Longer To Get To Our Room,,,,,
,75,It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Confirmatory Email At Time Of Booking,,,,,
,77,We Arrived Early  Think About 12.15Pm And Our First Room Was Ready By 2Pm But We Had To Wait Till 3.30Pm For Our Second Room  However It Wasnt Really A Problem As There Was So Many Things For Our Children To Do While We Were Waiting.,,,,,
,79,Not At All Everything Was Fantastic  The Wedding Was Superb Followed By Exquisite Food  The Room Was Very Nice And Everything We Needed For A Comfortable Stay  Breakfast Was Ok  Not The Best  Cold Plates Which Is A No No   Thats Our Only Little Niggle   Thank You,,,,,
,83,Would Have Liked Some Contact Prior To Our Arrival....Just A Quick Email Maybe,,,,,
,85,Porters Good And Very Friendly.  Always Smiling And Friendly On Leaving Or Returning To The Hotel.  Rather Made Up For Reception Staff,,,,,
,96,Hard To Find In The Dark. Better Driving Instructions,,,,,
,98,It Was Really Nice To Receive A Call The Day Before To See If I Needed Any Further Requirements. Nice Touch.,,,,,
,104,All The Staff Were Very Welcoming  Professional And Helpful.,,,,,
,108,You Could Do With Adding Better Signage To Direct People To The Hotel Particularly From Moretonhamstead  My Satnav Sent Me To North Bovey Which Meant Some Very Tight Country Lanes With No Signage At All. Not A Nice Experience.  ,,,,,
,116,Reception Team Were Fantastic Especially Sarah Who Changedbour Room As We Needed A Bath For Our Baby. Sarah Was Also Very Helpful With Baby Listening Service And Really Put Us At Ease And Helpedbus Have An Enjoyable Evening And Dinner.,,,,,
,121,No The Atmosphere Was As I Had Hoped It Would Be.,,,,,
,122,We Were Asked If We Wanted To Upgrade & Were Very Kindly Shown Both Rooms By Heather Who Was Charming & Very Efficient.,,,,,
,128,It Would Have Been Nice If We Were Told Of The Special Offer Â£49 For A 2 Ball Of Golf As We Would Have Arrived Earlier To Take Advantage Of This,,,,,
,130,Fishing Arrangement Was A Little Vague But Your Fish Fight Like Champions. Lovely Time.,,,,,
,131,On Arrival Everything Was Handled Efficiently And We Were Shown Where Everything Was Before Being Shown To Our Room; Something That Took About 10 To 15 Minutes.  However  Approx 30 Minutes Later When Wanting The Book An Eveing Meal And Sunday Lunch I Had To Remind The Same Member Of Staff Who Had Shown Us To Our Room Etc Who I Was And What My Room Number Was.  I Have Stayed At Many Hotels Where Staff Members Have Known Such Information Without Having Had Such Close Personal Contact.  A Small Point But Given The Exclusivity That Bovey Castle Is Seeking Then The Ability Of Staff To Remember Their Customers Would Be Worth Striving For.,,,,,
,134,All Good,,,,,
,142,All Luggage Taken From Car Not Just Labelled Luggage.  Luggage Taken To Wrong Room And  When Redirected  Wrong Luggage Delivered To Our Room.,,,,,
,148,A Member Of Family Joined Us Later In The Week And Arrived At 9Pm. She Had A Young Baby With Her And Was Directed By Reception Staff To The Car Park For The Lodges And Unfortunately Was Sent To The Wrong Lodge. This Meant She Was Wondering Around The Grounds At Night With A Baby And Eventually Had To Go Back To The Hotel. A Female Reception Staff Was Not Very Helpful But A Male Member Was And Realised There Were Two Different Parties Staying With The Same Surname And Then Explained Where She Needed To Go. The Female Staff Member Did Not Apologise Once Which Was Rather Upsetting For My Sister-In-Law. Not A Five Star Service!,,,,,
,152,It Was All Perfect,,,,,
,157,10 Out Of 10,,,,,
,160,Pre Arrival Contact Was Excellent  Very Efficient  Professional  Cheerful And Above All Friendly.  The Lady Went Out Of Her Way To Make Me Feel Welcome And When She Found Out Our Visit Was To Be A Birthday Treat (And The Same Day As Her Birthday) She Said That She Would Do Her Best To Put Us In A Room With A View Of The Grounds.  Which She Did.  Arrival Contact Was Excellent  Although The Young Man Who Took Our Bags In From The Car Was A Little Over Exuberant  But Extremely Polite And Efficient And Friendly.  Ashlie Showed Us Around As We Were A Little Too Early For Our Room.  She Was Excellent And A Real Asset To Your Staff.  She Was Very Relaxed  Knowledgeable  Professional  Explained How The Castle Worked And How We Would Find Everything To Make Us Feel Comfortable  And Generally Made Us Feel Welcome And We Were Really Looking Forward To Our Stay At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,161,We Asked For All Beds In The Lodge To Be Made Up As Doubles And One Was Made Up As Twin.,,,,,
,166,Amazing Golf Course And Wine List!,,,,,
,172,The Arrival Welcome Was Almost Over Enthusiastic - We Were Barely Out Of The Car When We Were 'Jumped' On By A Member Of Staff Firing Instructions At Us.,,,,,
,181,We Were Asked Prior To Arrival What Time We Would Arrive  Our Room Was Not Ready For Several Hours Later.,,,,,
,182,I Had Mentioned That It Was Our Wedding Anniversary And This Had Been Noted.  We Were Offered A Glass Of Champagne By Frediroc On Our Arrival  Which Was A Very Nice Touch!,,,,,
,186,An Explanation Regarding The Two Restaurants And An Offer To Book A Table Would Have Been Preferable To Being Handed A Card With Our Presumed Choice Of Restaurant And Times For 3 Nights.,,,,,
,187,The Lift Was Out Of Order When We Arrived But This Wasn't Mentioned To Us Untill We Were Being Shown To Our Room On The Third Floor Not A Major Problem But It Would Have Been Nice To Know In Advance We Might Have Waited Untill It Was Fixed.,,,,,
,189,The Staff Did An Excellent Job Checking Everyone In Especially As They All Arrived At The Same Time And They Were Polite And Helpful At All Times,,,,,
,190,Service Was Slow In The Edwardian Restaurant.,,,,,
,191,Helpful In Organising My Day,,,,,
,193,In Terms Of Pre Arrival Contact  I Booked The Trip Some Time Ago (Feb 2011) And Requested A Family Room As We Were Bringing Our Baby With Us.  Although We Requested A Junior Suite We Were Not Made Aware Of The Availability Of Separate Sleeping Areas In Some Junior Suites Which Would Have Made The Stay Much Easier For Us Had We Been Allocated One,,,,,
,198,Unfortunately No One Returned My Original Call So I Had To Call Again A Week Later. I Had An Email Asking For Which Treatments We Required  I Replied But Had No Confirmation So Rang The Morning Of The Spa Day And Asked The Reception Staff To Relay The Information To The Spa  However When I Turned Up For My Treatment The Message Had Been Relayed Incorrectly And The Therapist Was Expecting To Give Me A Scalp Treatment And Facial But I Had Asked For Balancing Back And Foot Treatment. The Names Within The Emails Were Not Correct.,,,,,
,200,Richard Particularly Commented On The Fact That The Staff Were Friendly And Chatty When We Wanted Them To Be But Discreet And Stood Back When They Knew We Wanted To Chat Amongst Ourselves Or Read The Paper  Etc.,,,,,
,205,Lots Of Useful Information And Very Accomodating Of Our Personal Needs And Requirements My Partners Birthday And Parking Of Our Motor Home!,,,,,
,213,I Had An Issue With My Credit Card Being Charged Twice And Then Refunded In Error. I Felt I Should Have Been Notified About This.,,,,,
,227,Had An Amazing Stay! Beautiful Luxurious Hotel  Every Detail Had Been Considered  We Have Not Stayed Anywhere So Relaxing And Cosy In S Ling Time. The Only Thing We Didnt Like Was The Decor In The Bistro  We Didnt Dine There But We're Surprised By The Canteen Feel Due To The Too Modern Minimal Choices  Reminded Us Of Eateries Attached To Travelodges  Sorry! It Didn't Fit In With The Rest Of The Hotel When It Could Easily Achieve This While Still Being A More Casual Dining Area. A Garden Room Feel With Wicker Furniture  Palms  Shutters Would Be Nice Or Go With The Traditional Pizzeria Feel Looking At Interiors In Italy From The Period Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,228,There Was Nowhere To Park Due To A Wedding And The Hotel Being Busy. Had To Hang Around And Ask At Reception Before Any Assistance Or Direction Was Provided. Not Easy With Young Baby,,,,,
,232,On Both Occasions That We Have Been To The Bistro Restaurant We Felt That The Service Was Well Below Of Our Expectations And Of The Standards That Bovey Castle Appears To Strive For. Each Time We Felt That The Staff Could Have Been A Lot More Attentive By Acknowledging Us On Entering The Restaurant  Showing Us To A Table And Bringing A Menu Without Us Having To Wait And Eventually Ask For One.However Everywhere Else All The Staff Have Been Fantastic And Could Not Have Done More For Us  Particularly The Blond Man Who Was Serving Afternoon Tea On The 23Rd July In The Oak Bar And Then Worked There Behind The Bar On The Same Day Late Evening.He Was Friendly  Very Professional And A Credit To The Hotel.,,,,,
,239,We Arrived At 1Pm But Our Room Was Not Ready (Understandable). We Went For Lunch In The Bistro But After This The Room Was Still Not Ready.  We Went And Sat In One Of The Lounges And Were Told That Staff Would Come And Get Us When Our Room Was Ready  They Never Did.  We Had To Go To Reception 3 Times To Enquire When Our Room Was Ready. When We We Were Showed To Our Room We Were Told That Our Bags Would Follow In 2 Minutes. After 30 Minutes They Had Still Not Arrived And With Two Kids We Were Very Keen To Make Use Of The Spa Facilities So We Rang Reception To See Where They Were.  It Took Another 30 Minutes For Them To Arrive. Not The Speed Of Service We Expect Of A 5 Star Hotel.,,,,,
,241,Friendly Staff And Thought The Quick Tour Of The Hotel  Although At The Time I Thought Abit Odd  Was Actually Brilliant As We Only Stayed One Night But Felt Instantly At Home So Actually A Great Little Touch.,,,,,
,244,The Room Information That We Were Given On Arrival Was Not Accurate (Already Detailed In Email To Manager),,,,,
,247,Would Have Been Nice To Get Twin Beds As Requested- Took 2 Attempts.,,,,,
,249,No,,,,,
,250,We Made Several Phone Calls Pre Arrival With Minor Queries Which Were Dealt With By Efficient And Knowledgeable Staff In A Courteous Manner.,,,,,
,253,All The Staff Make Customer Service Look Easy And Our One Night Away Made Us Feel Like We Had Had A Week Away ! We Will Be Back !,,,,,
,255,As We Arrived A Little Early  Our Room Wasn't Ready. So A Member Of Staff Kindly Showed Us Round And Touched On The History. We Had A Wander And Some Tea  Before Being Shown To Our Room.,,,,,
,257,The Meet And Greet As Our Car Arrived In The Driveway Is A Lovely Personal Touch And Very Welcoming. The Check In Staff Were Exceptionally Welcoming  Including Making Enquiries Re Dinner Despite Our 10.30Pm Arrival.,,,,,
,259,Communication Before Visit Is Always Excellent  Arrival Is Always Welcoming,,,,,
,265,Fantastic Staff Who Can't Do Enough For You,,,,,
,266,This Really Didn't Bother Me But We Were Advised That The Room Would Be Ready By 3Pm - That Someone Would Come And Get Us When It Was Ready.  We Waited And 3Pm Came And Went So We Decided To Check At Reception Who Advised It Was Ready(But No One Had Come To Advise Us).  We Were Helped To The Room By A Very Lovely And Efficient Young Man.  I Would Not Have Mentioned It As It Really Wasn't A Problem But Because They Had Said They Would Come And Set Us But Didn't - Not Good To Over Promise And Under Deliver.,,,,,
,269,Appreciated Phone Call Prior To Our Arrival  Also The Room Upgrade To Celebrate Our Birthdays Was A Lovely Surprise And Added Bonus.,,,,,
,270,Being Greeted On Arrival And Car Being Park Was Nice,,,,,
,275,Staff Very Friendly Both With The Email Before We Arrived & When We Arrived. Were Upgraded When Asked If Availability & Made Very Welcome.,,,,,
,276,So Efficient  And Made To Feel Entirely Welcome,,,,,
,278,Reception Were Very Friendly And Efficient,,,,,
,279,The Meet And Greet /Valet Personnel Were Excellent,,,,,
,282,I Was Offered A Coffee On Arrival  Which I Was Told Would Be Brought To My Room. After Waiting Approx Ten Minutes I Had To Phone Reception For The Promised Coffee.,,,,,
,285,Very Welcoming,,,,,
,286,No  Service Was Excellent,,,,,
,293,Just Made To Feel Very Special,,,,,
,294,No Comment Made By Staff As To The Reason For Our Visit  Even Though My Husband Had Discussed My Celebration With Your Reservation Staff On Making The Booking In January.,,,,,
,299,We Were A Little Nervous About Bringing Our Two Dogs But  Both Pre-Arrival And When We Turned Up  Your Staff Could Not Have Done More To Make Them More Welcome And Put Us At Ease.,,,,,
,301,All The Staff Are Very Helpful And Efficient But Some Are Very Young And Are Building Their Experience,,,,,
,303,It Was Not Clear To Us On Booking Our Summer Madness Package That A Service Charge Would Be Added To The Cost Of Accommodation And The Meal Allowance.,,,,,
,308,Excellent In Every Way  Professional And Welcoming.,,,,,
,309,One Our First Visit We Were Greeted At The Door  Our Car Keys Taken From Us And Our Luggage Brought In. On This Occasion There Was No Greeter But When We Got To Reception All Staff Really Pleasant And Helpful. On Our Second Day When We Came Back There Was No Greeter Again  Is This A Cut Back?,,,,,
,311,Arrival Was Fantastic- Great Impression As We Drove In (4 Cars)  3 Porters Were There Waiting To Take Our Luggage Which Was Taken In For Us And Everything Done Smoothly. We Arrived Very Early  But Was Made To Feel Welcome. Only Qualm Was The Keys For The Rooms  Some Didn't Work  Some Were Lost Etc. However Everything Else Was Perfect.,,,,,
,314,Poor Communication And Customer Service Skills At Time Of Reservation.,,,,,
,317,Staff Very Helpful And Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,
,320,We Thought The Staff Were Excellent And Very Welcoming And Friendly.,,,,,
,321,Arrival Was Extremely Efficient And Friendly - Really Felt You Were Welcome,,,,,
,323,A Telephone Call A Few Days Before We Arrived Was Appreciated. Staff On Arrival All Very Helpful.,,,,,
,331,Top Marks For Staff.,,,,,
,340,Very Well Presented For The Time Period With Relation To The Building  And That Was Why We Booked To Stay With You  To Get A Flavor Of Bygone Times. Well Done.,,,,,
,341,The Staff Who Showed Me To My Roon Has Led A Wrong Direction And Wrong Level. However She Was Nice And Friendly.,,,,,
,342,Very Friendly And Unpretentious ... Perfect For Me,,,,,
,343,The Was A Slight Personal Hygiene Issue With One Of The Waiters - A Whiff Of Body Odour At Dinner Is Somewhat Off Putting And Not Something One Would Wish To Mention ... !,,,,,
,351,Emails Could Be Answered More Promptly.,,,,,
,355,Welcome Both At The Door And At Reception Was Very Impressive And Made Us Feel Valued And Special,,,,,
,356,Lauren Gave Us A Warm Welcome And After Showing Us Our Room Give A Tour Of The Facilities And Ground Floor Rooms.,,,,,
,357,I Had Left An Answer Phone Message And My Call Was Not Returned.,,,,,
,358,Parking  Luggage Transfer And Escorted Introduction To Bedrooms All Done Very Well,,,,,
,359,Was Made To Feel Very Welcome,,,,,
,365,We Were Not Told About The Lack Of Falconry Display During Our Stay Which Is Something We Were Looking Forward To.,,,,,
,367,I Was Particularly Impressed With Felicity On Reception.  We Arrived Early And She Made Suggestions As To How To Pass The Time  Including A Tour And Recommended A View Of The Falconery Display.   ,,,,,
,371,Nothing Appeared To Be Too Much Trouble  However The Approach Was Almost A Little Too Laid Back As We Were Told To Wait For Someone To Come And Fetch Us  But After A Considerable Time Had To Remind Someone Else To Get Said Someone.,,,,,
,376,I Can't Remember The Blonde Lady's Name Who Was There When We Arrived (And Was There During Our Stay) But She Was Lovely. Really Welcoming.,,,,,
,378,We Was Welcomed By Hearing We Had Been Upgraded From A Superior Castle Room - Unfortunately We Was Disappointed With The Room We Was Given - Room 15,,,,,
,382,Sometimes Tricky Getting Through On Phone,,,,,
,385,The Staff Were Particularly Accommodating Of The Fact That We Arrived Early On The First Day  Thankyou.,,,,,
,386,Very Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,
,388,The Holiday Broker Advised Us To Contact Your Reception Desk In Advance Of Arrival Regarding Key Pickup. Quite Frankly  Such A Call Is Senseless  As Reception Personnel Seemed Unprepared And At A Loss For Words.,,,,,
,389,Excellent Tone With Everyone - We Really Appreciated Your Friendly Manner  Considering The Formal Nature Of The Setting. We Also Liked The Personal Touch From Federico!,,,,,
,392,Spotless,,,,,
,393,Always A Strong Point And Continues To Be,,,,,
,395,Reception Was Very Busy.  The Greeting Was Warm And Polite But I Could Have Done With Help Locating The Lodge And Lifting A Coupe Of Cases.,,,,,
,396,Can't Praise The Staff Enough  From The Moment We Handed Our Car Keys Over  We Felt Like Very Special Guests.  We Were Very Sorry To Say Goodbye Yesterday Morning.,,,,,
,398,Had A Curtisy Phone Call 2Days Before  Which Allowed My Wife To Book A Spar Treatment  A Very Nice Thing To Do.,,,,,
,400,Ashley Was Great At Check In And Very Helpful -- Touring Us Around  Etc.,,,,,
,403,Made To Feel At Home Straight Away,,,,,
,413,I Was Bowled Over By How Friendly And Unique Your Hotel Is  First Class.,,,,,
,419,No Comments,,,,,
,423,Email Contact Very Acceptable  Enabling The Booking Of Any Facilities Provided If Required,,,,,
,424,All Of The Staff Were Absolutely Charming And Very Helpful And Very  Very Polite. A Breath Of Fresh Air. Thank You.,,,,,
,431,Was Not Showed Around,,,,,
,433,We Were Shown To Another Guests Occupied Room Which Was Very Unaceptable As Our First Impression Was Shattered By This Mistake With Reception,,,,,
,434,Not Sure Why My Car Was Parked A Long Way From Reception - They Were Insistent. As We Were Playing Golf This Was Not Ideal. It's Not An Old Banger To Say The Least So I'm Not Clear Why It Was 'Hidden Away'.,,,,,
,436,I Was Given The Wrong Room  Unpacked The Bags And Having Waited Nearly An Hour For My Wife To Join Me After Walking The Dog  Discovered That She Had Been Shown To Our Allocated Room - Getting The 'Special Experience' Off To A Very Poor Start  Particularly As All Of The Unpacked Clothes Had To Be Moved.,,,,,
,437,We Were There For Our Wedding. Ashlie Wheale Had Done A Fabulous Job And Everything Went Like Clockwork. When We Arrived Everyone Knew Who We Were.,,,,,
,443,I Had Upgraded From The Basic Travelzoo Offer  But The Upgrade Was Not Recognised On Arrival.  We Arrived Early And  Understandably  The Room Was Not Ready; We Could Have Been Encouraged To Have A Pot Of Tea  Or A Snack In The Bistro.,,,,,
,445,Unfortunately Our Room Was Not Quite Ready For 3Pm But This Was Explained To Us And Dealt With In A Very Proper Way.,,,,,
,446,Nothing To Add - Just Super,,,,,
,450,I Paid Upon Booking With My Visa Card (Pam Carter ). Upon Checkout We Were Advised That This Was Just To Secure The Booking. We Were Asked To Pay The Full Amount Upon Checkout Which My Husband Richard Rodd Did Using His Credit Card. He Paid A Total Of 402.15 Bp Using His Master Card On 10/5/13 Receipt No 78797. My Visa Card Has Been Charged (No Longer Pending) We Have Payed Twice I Believe For The Accomodation.,,,,,
,451,We Arrived Early (Early Afternoon) And Our Room Wasn't Ready Which We Were Prepared For. However  We Had To Check With Reception If We Could Access Our Room  Despite The Fact That It Was Known That We Were In The Bar No-One Came To Tell Us That Our Room Was Ready.,,,,,
,455,Both Doormen/ Porters And Reception Staff Were Very Helpful And Very Friendly.,,,,,
,456,No - Everything Was Very Smooth,,,,,
,457,As A First Time Guest - Excellent Mini Guided Tour Of Hotel By A Member Of Staff,,,,,
,467,We Were Greeted By A Blonde Girl On Reception Who Was Brilliant And Showed Us Around Etc. Don't Remember Her Name But After Chatting For A Bit  Established She Had Only Been There For A Few Days- She Did Great :),,,,,
,472,I Arrived Very Late In The Evening So Probably Didn't Experience The Full Service - What I Did Notice Was That The Porter Wrote My Credit Card Number Down On Paper And I Felt Uncomfortable With This.  I Can't Fault All The Pre Arrival Help Received From Leah And The Team - It Was Excellent  Although I Would Have Liked To Have Been Able To Book All My Activities Online.,,,,,
,476,Very Efficient,,,,,
,477,The Service Was Flawless. Everyone Was Very Kind And Hospitable. It Was A Dream To Stay At Bovey. A Memory We Will Cherish.,,,,,
,481,The Booking Process Was Confused And Difficult. I Wasn't Confident That The Reservation Team And The Resort Desk Communicated With Each Other. Calls Were Supposed To Be Returned That Were Not And It Felt Like I Had To Do The Chasing By Calling Again.,,,,,
,484,Check-In Was Straightforward And Speedy The Lady Who Showed Us To Our Rooms Was Helpful And Happy To Find Out Extra Information That We Needed.,,,,,
,486,The Car Park Was Very Disorganised When We Arrived And Were Given No Advice Or Help Without Looking For It. A Chap Walked Through Reception Without A Shirt On And There Were Many Children Running Around It Was Rather Disappointing For First Impressions After Expecting So Much.,,,,,
,488,The Staff At The Spa Were Exceptional.  Everyone Else I Encountered Made Me Feel Like It Was To Much Trouble To Help.  1 Specific Example Was On Check Out: Where The Receptionist Asked Me How My Stay Was.  When I Told Her I Found The Staff Unhelpful  The Room Below Standard And That It Was A Disappointment I Had Been Unable To Have Dinner Or Breakfast In The Dinning Room Because Of A Group You Were Also Hosting  She Told Me It Was Just The Way Things Were And That The Group Took Priority Giving The Impression She Didn't Care That I Had Found My Stay Below My Expectation.,,,,,
,489,My Guests Were Not Received As Well A Me,,,,,
,495,I Was A Part Of The Wedding Party And Had Not Checked In Before Arriving With The Bride But The Staff Were Very Helpful And Quick With The Check In Process.,,,,,
,496,Very Quick And Efficient  Very Impressed!!,,,,,
,502,Sounds Like Silly Feedback - But It Is The Little Things That Make A Difference... Was Surprised Not To Be Wished Happy Birthday When It Was Revealed And Supposedly Noted When Booking And Also The Welcome Note In The Room Was Only Addressed To Mrs Cassidy - Not Mr And Mrs Cassidy.,,,,,
,509,Pre Arrival Was Very Good Arranging Flowers And Chocolates In The Room. Upon Arrival There Was No Valet Service  We Had To Carry Our Bags To Reception And At Reception Check Was Slow And Key Not Available,,,,,
,514,The Resort Team Were Excellent And Helped Book Our Dinner Times And Spa Treatments. Having Discussed With Them The Fact That This Was A Special Occasion To Celebrate Our Wedding Anniversary And That We Were Travelling Considerable Distance To Get There I Had Hoped We Would Have Been Offered An Upgrade To Our Rooms.,,,,,
,518,We Were Offered A Glass Of Champagne To Celebrate Our Recent Marriage Which Was A Very Nice Touch,,,,,
,522,Staff Were Always Friendly& Very Helpful & They Did A Great Job!,,,,,
,544,The Bellman Who Took Us To Our Room Gave Us A Quick Overview Of The Amenities In The Room  Pointed Out Where Things Were  And Even Offered To Give Us A Tour Of The Property. This Was A Very Nice Touch.,,,,,
,546,Perfect,,,,,
,549,We Arrived Late At Night And The Car Park Area Outside The Hotel Was Very Dark With No Staff To Be Seen.  It Would Have Been Much Nicer To Have Someone Available On Arrival.  We Had To Go In To The Hotel To Ask Someone Where To Park Our Car (Didn't Know It Was Valet) Etc.,,,,,
,555,We Did Book Through Groupon  So This Issue Isn't Probably Something You Had Control Over  But Our Booking Proceedure Was A Hassle And Deeply Disappointing. Several Times We Were Promised That From Xx Time We Could Book  Only For The System Not To Be Available. Glad We Persevered Though.,,,,,
,558,None,,,,,
,560,We Had To Ask To Be Shown Around.  Also  No One Explained The Difference Between The Bistro And The Grill When I Booked Over The Phone.  Had They Done So  We Would Have Booked The Grill.  We Were Under The Impression The Bistro Was The More Formal Option.,,,,,
,563,Our Meal Was A Bit Late - Only Sat Down At 9:45 (Table Was 45 Minutes Later Than Stated),,,,,
,565,Service Was Very Slow In The Bistro And Piano Bar For Drinks,,,,,
,566,I Had To Ask A Lot Of Questions At Reception When I First Booked In Re. Restaraunts / Spa / Breakfast Etc.,,,,,
,568,Everything Was Excellent!,,,,,
,570,Rebecca Smith Was Very Helpful With The Organising Pre Arrival. The Porter John Was Very Attentive On Site - Excellent.,,,,,
,582,We Accidentally Parked In The Wrong Place And Were Rather Strongly Told To Move Which Wasnt The Best Start. Its Not Totally Clear That It Is All Valet Parking (Or Perhaps We Missed The Sign On Entrance)  But Perhaps It Could Have Been Slightly More Polite Than 'Move'.   From Entrance Into The Hotel  Check In And Being Shown To The Room Etc Were All Fantastic Though.,,,,,
,584,Staff Were Very Friendly. We Had No Help Unloading The Car Though. This Was More Difficult As The Stair Gates Ordered Were Not In Place So One Of Us Had To Stay With Children All The Time. We Were Also Unable To Eat Afternoon Tea As All Places Were Reserved. If Only The Hotel Had Advised Us To Book Before We Arrived. Not A Very Welcoming Event!,,,,,
,586,Overall  It Is Great Experience.  Before My Arrival  I Managed To Book Activities With The Resort Desk Via Phone And Email.  And  I Got A Quick Response.,,,,,
,587,Thank You For Your Flexibility  Allowing Us To Arrive One Night Early At Rose Cottage.,,,,,
,591,We Were Looked After Well.,,,,,
,594,From The Moment We Were Offered Mulled Wine In The Hall It Felt Like Christmas.  A Very Warm  Welcoming Atmosphere.,,,,,
,596,Arrival Excellent And Reception Staff Very Helpful. Bar Staff Also Very Good And Attentive However Staff In Main Restaurant Not So Good.,,,,,
,601,The Reservations Team And Reception Staff Were Very Helpful In Making The Changes I Needed To My Reservation.,,,,,
,604,Having Stated That It Was A Suprise And Having Booked Spa Treatments I Was Upset To Have Received A Telephone Call Left On My Answering Machine Trying To Sell Me Spa Treatments. My Wife Picked Up The Message Thus Spoiling The Surprise.  In Addition I Would Ahve Expected A Note On The System To Say That It Was A Surprise And That Treatments Had Been Booked.  At The Very Least The Staff Member That Called Should Have Checked The System To See If We Have Something Booked  It Was Very Annoying And Unprofessional,,,,,
,608,We Were Told That The Castle Was Very Quiet  However When We Arrived Our Room Still Wasn't Ready. I Know Check In Is Not Until 3Pm But Seeing As We Had Hotel Transport To Pick Us Up From Exeter And They Knew We'd Be Arriving Before 3Pm (Arrived At Around 1.30Pm)  I Would Have Thought That They Could Have Made An Effort To Have Our Room Ready - Especially Seeing As The Hotel Wasn't Fully Booked. Also On Our Arrival Nobody Offered To Show Us Around At All.,,,,,
,610,We Felt The Greeting By Your Reception Staff Was Not Great.  They Were More Interested In Speaking Between Themselves.,,,,,
,611,2 Out Of 3 Rooms Were Not Ready On Arrival.  Staff Dealt With That As Best They Could  But Still Disappointing.,,,,,
,612,On Arrival The Cathedral Room And Reception Area Were Over Smokey.,,,,,
,615,The Arrival Would Have Been Better If The Foot Staff Were At The Front Of The Hotel As The Car Pulled Up,,,,,
,618,Friendly And Helpful,,,,,
,619,Celia And Kerstin From Er Were Good And Presented An Overview Of What Was Available. However A More Directed Selection Rather Than A 'Good For Everyone' Focus Would Have Been Better.,,,,,
,622,Extremely Professional And Helpful Arrangements Ahead Of Time  And Very Warm Welcome Upon Arrival.,,,,,
,623,The Staff Dealing With Booking Extra Activities Were Very Helpful And Efficient However Trying To Make Advance Bookings From Your Wine List Prived Extremely Difficult. Once At The Hotel The Wine Staff Were However Very Good.,,,,,
,624,Not Very Quick At Returning Phone Calls,,,,,
,632,The Staff On Arrival Were Excellent.  Our Luggage Arrived At Our Lodges Promptly And The Pep-Talk About The Accommodation Excellent.  We Were Also Permitted To Have A Very Early Check-In Which Was Fantastic.  One Small Negative Comment: We Were Quite Strongly Encouraged To Have Pre-Dinner Cocktails In The Bar Before Dinner  Only Later Finding Out A Â£30 Charge Per Head.  I Wasn't Impressed By The Selling Technique.,,,,,
,638,The Place Was Run Like Fawlty Towers In My Opinion. The Staff At Reception Were Terrible  Both Rude And Unhelpful As Were The Waiting Staff At The Wedding Breakfast And At Breakfast The Following Day. However  The Bar Staff On The Evening Were Great.,,,,,
,641,Staff In Restaurants Could Be Hit And Miss With Level Of Service . Order Food / Toast / Drinks For Breakfast And Did Not Arrive Many Times .No Toast And Then Came To Late On  Various Days . Tables Did Not Set Up With Correct Cutlery Till Food Arrived In The Bistro . You Would Request Something And The Staff Would Forget. Bed Linen Not Changed When It Was Accidentally Wet By Baby And The Bed Was Just Made Up Again Damp. Also There Was A Mark On The Bed As Daughter Out Chocolate On It And It Was Never Changed And Our Stay Was 3 Days. No Pimms To Drink In August. Generally No Consistent Approch To Waiting On Tables And To The Level Of Service You Recieved In Both Restaurant .,,,,,
,643,We Arrived Late Afternoon And Went Downstairs To Have Tea But Were Not Met With The Usual Level Of Service We Have Had Previously From Bovey.  We Had To Wait Quite Some Time For Tea And Repeatedly Ask When Our Order Would Arrive.  We Had A Similar Scenario The Following Day At Tea As Well And Didn't Find The Staff Particularly Warm Or Inviting  Which Was Not Like Our Previous Experiences At Bovey.,,,,,
,646,No Signage In Car Park / Entrance - Didn't Know Where To Park Or Where The Entrance Was  So Drove Around For 5 Mins  No One Approached Us To Help.,,,,,
,648,Arrival Was Good  Shown To Room And Helped With Luggage.  When We Left We Were Not Helped With Our Luggage Until We Were Half Way Across The Front Courtyard,,,,,
,650,No,,,,,
,651,Reservation Booking  Email Coorespondance And Arrival / Settling In Were Excellent.  I Think More Notice Could Be Given On Email Instructions Re: Satnav Post Code (Which Misdirects).,,,,,
,652,Absolutely Excellent Arrival Process .... We Were Running Slightly Late For Our Prebooked Lunch So Left Our Car (Packed To The Rafters With Luggage) At The Front Door And Went Straight For Lunch.  After Lunch We Checked In And Were Taken To Our Lodge And Found That The Car Had Been Emptied Of Luggage  The Fire Was On And Even Our Chilled Food Had Been Placed In The Fridge - Fantastic Service  Thank You.,,,,,
,657,I Did Not Receive A Booking Confirmation Email And Had To Ring Up A Few Days Before To Check That Our Reservation Existed.,,,,,
,659,Very Professional And Friendly Service - Your Staff Could Not Do Too Much To Assist Us.,,,,,
,660,Bell Boys Accepted A Tip For Bringing In Luggage. This Was Wrong Of Them  As We Later Realized That There Was A 10 Percent Service Charge On Everything To Cover Things Like This. It Would Have Been More Honest For Them To Tell Us This At The Time  Because We Felt Ripped Off When We Found Out Later.,,,,,
,664,Was Kept Waiting From 1Pm Until 3Pm To Gain Access To Room - Although This Is Following The Rules I Felt Some Flexibility Could Have Been Shown,,,,,
,666,The Dinning Room And The Swimming Pool Are Out-Of-Date.  The Sleeping Room And The Other Rooms Are Pleasant And Comforable.,,,,,
,676,We Found Your Reception Staff To Be Lacking On All Three Occasions We Used Them.  On Arrival There Was No Welcome Or Any Interest In Us Apart From Our Credit Card Details. No Help Was Given When Requesting To Change The Dinner Reservation.  On Contacting Reception Regarding A Noisy Dog Outside The Room We Were Told That It Would Be Leaving Before The Night So Would Not Be A Problem. This Was Not The Case As It Was There Our Entire Stay. Luckily This Did Not Affect Our Sleep But Why Were We Given Wrong Information. On Check Out We Were Not Asked About Our Stay  If There Were Any Problems.  We Did Not Feel Valued Or Of Any Interest To Your Reception Staff.,,,,,
,682,I Have Emailed The Hotel Manager A List Of Errors That Tool Plce,,,,,
,685,Reception And Staff Awaiting Outside Were Excellent.  The Resorts Team Was Hard To Get Hold Of As We Had Booked And Tried To Book Some Additional Activities. But Very Helpful Once Could Get Hold Of Them. The Room Service Missed Our Order The First Day  Was 5 Minutes Later Than The Latter End Of The Delivery Time Slot And Were 5 Minutes Before The Latter End Of The Delivery Time Slot On The Final Day.,,,,,
,697,Excellent,,,,,
,701,Arrival Was Fantastic  Was Welcomed At My Car  Luggage Taken  Greeted By Hotel Manager At Door  Got A Great Tour Of Hotel And Luggage Taken To Rooms - A Great Start To The Experience.,,,,,
,702,All Very Efficient And Welcoming.,,,,,
,703,The General Manager (Federico) Is Worth His Weight In Gold - And Gold Is Very Expensive These Days!  He Really Pulled Out The Stops For Us And Was There At The Right Time Whenever We Needed Him And Even When We Didn't.,,,,,
,707,No,,,,,
,711,Reception Staff Very Friendly On Arrival (And Previously On Phone). Porter Was Helpful But Not Warm Or Friendly - Unsmiling,,,,,
,712,Would Have Been Nice To Be Greeted At The Door By Porter To Help Us With Luggage/ Valet Parking. Except From That The Arrival Was Great.,,,,,
,713,We Were Advised By Reception We Could Have Afternoon Tea In Any Lounge And Prior To Arrival We Had Been Advised We Did Not Need To Book Afternoon Tea. The First Lounge We Entered We Were Asked Had We Booked We Said No And Were Directed To Another Lounge Instead. We Had Tea And It Was Fine But Confusing.,,,,,
,715,Ashleigh Showed Us Around And Was Very Attentive To Our Family Throughout Our Stay.,,,,,
,723,Were Unable To Book Some Activities Prior To Arrival Despite A Couple Of Phone Calls - This Would Have Allowed Us To Make More Of Our Short Stay,,,,,
,735,It Was A Very Exciting Experience.,,,,,
,743,It Would Have Been Nice To Be Told That You Need To Book The Afternoon Tea (That Was Included In Our Package) In Advance. When I Asked On The Morning We Wanted To Have It  It Was Fully Booked. Luckily They Managed To Squeeze Us In Later In The Afternoon.,,,,,
,744,Thank You For The Lovely Champagne On Arrival.,,,,,
,746,We Should Have Been Informed The Pool Would Be Closed During Our Stay?,,,,,
,759,Porters Excellent Reception Not So! Should Have Booked Tables In Restaurant For Us. The Reception Is Also The Concierge  And It Was Their Job To Ensure We Had Booked Table In Restaurant.  We Had Not Booked And Bank Holiday Was Very Busy. Most Hotels Mention This When You Check In. Reception Said Nothing. We Regard This As Very Poor. ,,,,,
,773,Booked Via Helpful Holidays  Which All Seemed Very Straightforward  Would Certianly Use Them Again. Check-In On Arrival Was Quick  Efficient And Very Friendly,,,,,
,777,Excellent - Nice Meet And Greet On The Forecort - Full Escort To Lodge.  Felt Very Welcomed And Staff Fully Aware Of Any Of Our Pre Bookings (Tennis Court Etc).,,,,,
,785,Thank You For The Champagne And Kids Cocktail.  I Still Think The Room Should Have Been Ready At 3Pm.,,,,,
,787,Very Friendly And Efficient With Luggage And Parking Of Car.,,,,,
,792,We Were Showed Around The Hotel And Spa Which Was Very Informative.,,,,,
,793,It Would Have Been Helpful To Have Been Advised To Book Dinner In The Restaurant  On Arrival. I Was Disappointed To Have To Eat In The Bistro As Although Staff Excellent  Bistro Is Looking In Need Of Refurbishment And Menu Was Limited,,,,,
,802,Yes  The One Thing That Stuck Out Was The Inconsistency Of The Pricing And Packages Offered To Me.  I Phoned Initially And Had To Change Things A Few Times.  Each Time I Phoned Back Something Changed.  When I Changed My Reservation From Two Nights To Three Nights The Person On The Phone Tried To Take My Mid-Week Package Away From Me Even Though The Nights Were All Still Mid-Week.  I Found This Disconcerting.  I Sold Two Other Families From Harrow School On Bovey And They Ended Up Booking As Well.  I Had To Say That I Knew One Of The Families Received A Mid Week Special On Their Three Night Stay  Which The Receptionist Put Me On Hold To Check  Before I Was Allowed It.,,,,,
,808,Ultimately Discrete,,,,,
,809,When We Checked In  Wasn't Given Any Information Regarding Activities And Times At Castle.  Some Gals At Front Desk Were Very Cool And Not Receptive To Questions Or Any Type Of Guidance.,,,,,
,812,Reservation Staff Very Helpful,,,,,
,817,We Were Very Impressed With The Way The Staff Handled Our Arrival Ensuring That We Knew What To Do  Where To Go And Were Not Left Alone Without Knowing What Was Going To Happen Next.  Also Appreciated A Pre-Visit Phone Call Because They Had Realised We Hadn't Booked A Dinner Table.,,,,,
,820,Our Lodge Was Not Ready When We Arrived - We Were A Little Earlier That Stipulated Check In But It Would Have Been Good If It Had Been Ready.,,,,,
,822,All Very Efficient,,,,,
,823,We Were Very Lucky To Have Been Double Booked At Another Place  So Then We Accepted This Alternative  As We Had The Most Perfect Girls Weekend Away  And Will Highly Recommend Your Hotel And Especially The Lodges.,,,,,
,824,Very Dated Shabby Reception Area  Behind The Desk Reminiscent Of Fawlty Towers! Only One Key Per Room Which Didn't Fit Well!,,,,,
,830,We Were Not Informed Of The Dinner Supplement Nor Was This Pointed Out At The Time Of Booking Until We Asked How The Menu Worked With Individual Prices,,,,,
,835,Staff Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,837,They Were Ok Till We Pointed Out A Problem  Then They Were Dismissive Uninterested And Slightly Unfriendly,,,,,
,842,The Bistro Food And Service Cld Be Improved.,,,,,
,844,The Marketing Contact Carefully Explained The Differences Between The Different Rooms Which Was Helpful In Making The Correct Choice Of Room.,,,,,
,849,Amazing Staff!,,,,,
,853,Slightly Confusing On Arrival As It Was Not 100% Clear Where To Initially Park.,,,,,
,857,The Bistro Does Not Live Up To The Superior Standards Of The Rest Of The Hotel  Both In Terms Of Design And Food Quality. The Same Is True For The Gym  Pool And Spa: Outmoded Pool Design  Run-Down And Dingy Sauna And Steam And Cramped Gym (And The Rest Of The Spa Area On A Different Floor Which Is Also Not Ideal). I Would Not Want To Be A Spa Member Here.,,,,,
,859,No,,,,,
,865,Christopher Made Us Feel Very Welcome However It Would Have Helped If You Mentioned That There Is No Telephone Reception. Not A Huge Problem ( And Rather Refreshing!) But That Way I Could Have Warned People Looking After The Kids At Home Etc.,,,,,
,884,On Arrival A Wedding Fayre Was Taking Place  The Welcome Wasn't As Expected  When We Stayed Previously A Gentleman Collected Our Luggage From The Car And We Were Shown Into The Drawing Room And Offered Champagne And Then Shown To Our Room. On This Visit We Brought In Our Own Luggage  Checked In And Were Then Shown To Our Room.I Spoke With Members Of Your Reservation Team Before Our Arrival As The Weather Conditions Were Atrocious (Heavy Snow)  We Decided To Make The Journey As We Were Celebrating My Husband's Birthday; At No Point Was I Advised That There Was A Wedding Fayre Taking Place Or That The Hotel Was Hosting A Corporate Event The Following Day Therefore We Could Not Use Any Of The Facilities From12 Noon Onwards.,,,,,
,886,Would Have Been Helpful To Put A Sign By Service Entrance To Advise Guests Not To Use That. We Drove Down An Extremely Narrow Lane To Get To The Castle To Be Told That A Few Yards Down The Road Was The Main Entrance. The Satnav Seemed To Take Us The 'Quicker' Way,,,,,
,888,The Booking Communication With The Reservations Group Was Difficult With Miscommunication Requiring Several Call Backs To Work Through Miscommunications.,,,,,
,892,Reception Were Helpfull With Access To Wifi  Bar Staff Were A Little Flipant And Quite Loud When The Bar Was Quite Which Is A Little Unprofessional  However They Were Polite And Efficient To All Guests. When Quite Some Quality Background Music Would Help Both Staff And Guests.,,,,,
,893,We Loved The Brief Tour Of The Hotel Upon Arrival - This Is Something That Is Lacking In Most Hotels.,,,,,
,895,No,,,,,
,896,Very Warm Reception,,,,,
,898,Directional Signage And Driving Directions Need Desperate Improvement!,,,,,
,906,All Good - Very Welcoming.,,,,,
,908,We Were Shown To Our Room But Not Told Where Anything Else Was.,,,,,
,910,The Lady On Reception Was Not Engaged At All.  I Was Surprised That Having Made A Booking Through One Particular Person (Polly) She Did Not Bother To Seek Us Out At All During Our Stay.  I Was Also Annoyed That My Colleagues Were'forced' To Hand Over A Credit Card Despit All Details Of Credit Card Etc Having Alreayd Been Supplied,,,,,
,912,It Was Very Difficult Getting Hold Of Reservations Team Prior To Our Stay. A Couple Of Times No-Ne Answered The Phone At All. I Left A Couple  Of Message For Reservations To Call Me Back But No-One Did. One Lady That My Partner Spoke To Was Quite Brusque.,,,,,
,916,Very Attentive  Excellent Attention To Detail.,,,,,
,919,I Had A Number Of Phone Calls From The Resorts Team To Confirm Spa  Golf And Dinner Bookings And Was Very Impressed With The Attention To Detail And Helpfulness.,,,,,
,920,I Had Initial And Very Efficient Contact With The Activities Desk.  I Then Wanted To Make Changes And Sent 2 Emails And Left One Voicemail Over A Period Of A Week And Got No Answer - Apparently The Person I Was Dealing With Was On Holiday.  I Would Have Thought Her Emails Would Have Been Monitored In Her Absence And I Was Surprised No One Responded To My Voicemail. I Had To Ring 3 Times Before I Got Someone To Speak To.,,,,,
,925,Phone Call Re Dinner Res.  Bad Signal But You Never Called Back To Onfrm I Had Asked For Dinner Booking On Night Of Arrival.  I Called A Couple Of Times But Unable To Get Through.  Left Message Re Dinner Res Clearly Not Followed Up,,,,,
,933,Delighted That There Was No Stuffiness - All The Staff Were Delightful.,,,,,
,942,On Our Previous Visit We Were Greeted With A Glass Of Bubbly On Arrival Which Felt Special  Shame That's Been Stopped.,,,,,
,946,I Have Only Marked 'The Staff Were Efficient And Made My Arrival Easy' A 3 Because I Phoned For Directions And Was Given Incorrect Information On 2 Occasions Meaning I Had To Retrace My Steps Twice And Eventually Arrived Rather Stressed As A Result Having Toured The Area For Some Time Before Eventually Being Given The Correct Directions And Finding The Hotel.  Other Than That  The Staff Were Very Good On Arrival And The Concierge Was Particularly Helpful.  I'm Sorry I Didn't Get His Name So I Can't Give Credit To Him.,,,,,
,965,The Restaurant Is Just A Bit Stuffy And When Empty Has Little Character But Really Enjoyed Our Stay And Will Come Again,,,,,
,966,Received A Pre Arrival Email Which We Thought Inappropriate - It Documented The Internal Discussions Between Reservations And Management,,,,,
,971,Nothing  We Were Greeted In A Friendly And Professional Manner.,,,,,
,975,I Thought  That It Is A Pity  That The Nice Castle Courtyard Is Full Of Cars. (There Was Any Party When We Arrived  So There Were Many Many Cars Standing Around. A Carpark Outside Somewhere Would Have Been Nicer.,,,,,
,989,Did Not Get Explained To About How The Car Parking Worked & No One There To   Help Straight Away When We Arrived.  No One There Straight Away  To Help Where We Parked Our Car.,,,,,
,992,I Didn't Like My Car Being Taken Away And To Have To Ask If I Wanted Access To It.,,,,,
,997,Laura Contacted Me Per Arrival To Arrange The Golf And The Evening Meal. Was Very Impressed With The Service.,,,,,
,998,We Arrived Very Late (1 Am) And A Wonderful Gentleman By The Name Of Martin Greeted Us Warmly And Helped Us Up To Our Room.  He Even Made Sure That We Got 'Last Call' At The Bar!,,,,,
,999,We Were A Little Late But The Team In The Golf Pro Shop Were Very Helpful.,,,,,
,1000,N/A,,,,,
,1001,Enjoyed The Experience Of Being Met By The Charming Manager And His Well Dressed And Organised Team Who Tagged And Delivered Our Bags To Our The Rooms.,,,,,
,1006,From Previous Information  I Expected Someone To Greet Me And Move My Car On Arrival.  I Had To Struggle Through The Heavy Front Door With My Luggage As The Member Of Staff Who Should Have Been Helping Me Carried On Washing A Car (Presumably Another Guest's).  Not A Good Start.  I Was Not Helped Out With My Bags On Departure Either.,,,,,
,1007,Well Organized Despite The Size Of The Group.,,,,,
,1021,Very Good And All Very Helpful,,,,,
,1023,Smooth Process.  Staff Were Very Helpful As My Husband Is Disabled.  He Enjoyed Himself.  This Is What I Hoped For Him.,,,,,
,1029,Perfect,,,,,
,1033,We Had Been Telephoned On A Couple Of Occasions Prior To Our Arrival To Enquire If We Would Like To Book A Table In The Restaurant. We Declined As We Were Unsure At What Time We Would Be Arriving  But I Think It Showed That We Were Not Simply Taken For Granted Once Our Booking Had Been Made.,,,,,
,1035,Arrival Was Fine. Staff Were Very Helpful And Although We Arrived In Heavy Rain We Did Not Need To Get Wet As Our Car Was Parked For Us Etc.,,,,,
,1039,The Staff Rapidly Changed Our Rooms When They Noticed We Had A Disabled Party Member  And We Were Ushered To A Lounge.  Whilst We Waited We  Ordered Drinks They Took Far Too Long & A Prompt To Arrive  In Fact We Had To Take Them To Our Rooms,,,,,
,1042,All Good,,,,,
,1043,We Were Met In A Very Friendly And Professional Way. We Had Booked A Classic Room But Paid To Up-Grade On The Receptionist's Recommendation. Our Room Was Not Ready So We Sought Details Of The Local Area As A Friend Had Suggested A Walk Along The River To The Village. The Local Maps Were Not Supplied Until We Asked For Them So We May Have Felt A Bit 'Lost' Without Our Friends' Input.,,,,,
,1047,Very Efficient,,,,,
,1049,Staff Were Extremely Professional And Courteous,,,,,
,1051,Being Shown To The Wrong Room Didn't Bode Well.,,,,,
,1061,The Reception Team  Bistro And The Men At The Door  Meet And Greet Etc. Were Extremely Helpful  Courteous And Friendly.  Staff In The Bar And Main Restaurant Were Not Quite As Efficient Or Friendly. In Fact The Bar Waitress Was Somewhat Surly!,,,,,
,1064,Date Error Made But Promptly Rectified Following A Phone Call  However I Needed To Call Back To Request An Email Confirmation.,,,,,
,1067,Staff Should Have Been More Intuitive When I Told Them About Name Changes And That Our Daughter Was Recently Widowed They Did Mot Think To Translate This Into Table Settings And Even When Taken Up At Our First Meal It Stil  Was Not Relayed To Managers.,,,,,
,1071,I Found The 'Green Cones' A Little Off Putting. I Had No Idea Where I Was Supposed To Park My Car. I Squeezed In Between Two Cones And Was Then Approached By A 'Valet Parker'.  At Reception  I Was Surprised That Our Room Was Not Ready Since It Was After 3Pm. My Wife Asked Reception To Give Us A Nice Room Since It Was My 60Th Birthday. She Was Assured That Our Room Was Nice.  After Tea  We Were Shown To Our Room Which Turned Out To Have A View Of The Kitchen Block Roof. So Much For It Being Nice.   After Some Negotiation  We Paid For An Upgrade To A Valley Classic Room And  After Some Delay  Moved In There At About 4:30Pm.  There Did Seem To Be Some Poor Communication Between The Reception Staff And Porters So We Had To Ring Reception Several Times Before We Were Moved To The New Room.,,,,,
,1072,With Only One Sign In Mortonhampstead Facing Along The Lane We Immediately Were Confused - Having Asked A Local We Reached The 3212 Road  But Then Saw The Turning To North Bovey On The Left And Spent The Next 30 Minutes Looking For A Bovey Castle Brown Sign In The Village.  A Visit To The Pub  And We Were Sorted  But Then Arrived Very Fraught And One And A Half Hours Later.  Coming From The Cotswold Area  Nr Bath We Are Use To Small Roads Etc  But More Signs Would Help  As I Did Not Print The Hotel Map Either  Thinking The Castle  Would Be Visible For Miles - Wrong....,,,,,
,1075,I Emailed The Hotel Prior To Our Arrival And Got A Very Prompt Helpful Reply.,,,,,
,1076,Very Helpful With The Booking. Very Easy To Arrange A Special Birthday Cake.,,,,,
,1083,Everything Was Efficient  Professional And Friendly.  Thank You.,,,,,
,1084,Julia Is A First Class Reception Manager,,,,,
,1086,Enjoyed The Showround To Understand The Layout Of The Hotel And Where The Facilities Were Located,,,,,
,1091,We Arrived At 1.00 P.M. And Our Room Was Not Ready.  I Am Not Sure Whether It Was Clearly Confirmed At What Time Our Room Would Be Ready.,,,,,
,1096,We Arrived At 2.30 Pm And Our Room Was Not Ready - Understandable As A 3.00 Pm Arrival Is Advised.  But We Waited Another Hour And Was Told The Room Was Ready Only When We Went Back To Ask.  Knowing We Were In The Hotel  We Should Have Been Told Immediately That Was So.,,,,,
,1098,Initial Confirmation Of Booking Document Contained Faults That Made Some Information Impossible To Read.,,,,,
,1100,No,,,,,
,1101,Loved The Owl In Reception,,,,,
,1105,No,,,,,
,1108,The Staff In The Dining Room At Times Did Not Understand Our Orders Especially At Breakfast When Some Of Our Party Waited Almost An Hour For Their Orders  And Staff Training Seemed Non Existant.  We Lovestaying At Bovey And Willcome Back Again  Also Disappointed With Our 'Attic' Rooms But All In All A Good Few Days.,,,,,
,1114,Brilliant Pr To Have Someone Telephone The Evening Before To Make Sure Everything Ok And Enquire If Any More Can Be Booked/Arranged.,,,,,
,1123,We Were Told Bovey Not Too Busy. However  It Turned Out To Be Only Ourselves And One Small Family As Guests During Our Stay  As Far As We Could Ascertain.,,,,,
,1128,Well Iniyially  The Reception Staff Did Not Seem To Be Aware As To How We Came To Be There But A Warme Efficient Process Nevertheless.,,,,,
,1131,Had Excellent Response To Email Inquiries And Our Transportation Arrangements While Expensive Were Handled Well.,,,,,
,1134,We Requested Conformation Twice - It Eventually Arrived.,,,,,
,1139,All Excellent,,,,,
,1148,No,,,,,
,1155,No,,,,,
,1156,Our Son Booked It For Us So We Can't Really Comment On This.  For Our Diamond Wedding It Was Magical.,,,,,
,1157,It Was A Somewhat Disappointing Arrival And First Impression As I Had Not Expected To Be In A Lodge Far Rom The Hotel,,,,,
,1160,I Don't Usually Respond To Surveys But Since Our Stay Was Exceptional I Thought It Best I Do. You Probably Get Many More Complaints Than Compliments. In One Word.....Flawless. Your Staff Is Perfect The Dining Superb And The Surrounding Ambiance Excellent. Our Room Was Lacking Nothing. We Will Certainly Return And Have Already Mentioned Our Experience To Friends. Thanks For A Wonderful Stay. Morrie Neiss,,,,,
,1165,There Was A Lack Of Tie Up Between The Desk And The Booking Staff And It Took A Long Time To Sort Out.,,,,,
,1167,You Didn't Know It But The Stay Was A Surprise Birthday Present So Your Pre-Visit Call Gave The Game Away. Don't Know If It's Possible To Ask If Guests Would Prefer Not To Be Contacted Pre-Visit. Otherwise It's A Lovely Courtesy.,,,,,
,1169,Hello Frederico We Are The Family You Met Who Kept Eating The Lovely Sole In The Bistro - I Have Known Ben More Some 35 Years. I Was So Pleased With Our Stay That On 8/9Th September I Have Treated My Son And Very Pregnant Daughter-In-Law (Richard And Lyndsey Jones) To A Weekend With You.  Kitty Jay Lodge Was Excellent - Very Well Equipped And Just Right For An Extended Family. The Hotel Itself Was Great In Every Way And Please Commend The Staff On Their Positive Attitude Towards Little Children  Especially Becka In The Bistro. The Only Problem We Had Was The Slowness Of The Service In The Bistro - Where We Ate Every Evening. I Appreciate That The Food Is Freshly Cooked And Can Happily Wait For That But The Length Of Time Before Orders Are Taken And The Drinks Delivered Is Unacceptable  Especially With Children. That Apart  We All Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay With You And I Am Sure We Will Be Back. Lucille Jones,,,,,
,1170,Yes  I Would Like To Add That On Arrival We Were Treated Well  But On Complaining At Midnight That We Could Not Sleep Due To The Central Heating System Making A Loud Knocking Sound  And Told That The Duty Manager Would Be Informed.  To Date We Have Not Heard Anything.  When Checking Out We Were Informed That The Duty Manager Would Be Telephoning Us To Discuss Our Complaint. We Are Still Waiting.  We Were Very Surprised That A Duty Manager Did Not Speak To Us Whilst We Were At The Hotel.,,,,,
,1173,We Stayed In Kitty Jay Lodge - What A Nightmare On Arrival After A Difficult Journey Now It Has Been Made Into A One-Way Route To And From The Car Park To The Lodges.,,,,,
,1175,Mistakes Via Email Prior To Arrival Almost Made Me Cancel My Booking. A Tour Of The Hotel Never Happened. Hunt For Lunch Menus Left The Family Bemused And Unimpressed. Lunch Was Acceptable.,,,,,
,1180,Stayed In Room 1 On 22 March  All Staff Very Good  And Nice To See A Hands On Manager Like Federico. My Daughter Lisa Seymour Has Booked A Cottage For 10/11/12 April - I Am Sure She Will Enjoy Her Holiday At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,1184,None,,,,,
,1185,I Run An Event Management And I Wanted To Visit The Hotel Before Recommeding It To Large Corporate Clients,,,,,
,1195,Valet Parking Service Very Good,,,,,
,1196,All Wonderful And Best Of Anywhere We Have Been,,,,,
,1198,We Were Very Disappointed With Our Room ( No. 33 )  As The Hotel Was Obviously At Low Occupancy  We Would Have Hoped Not To Find Ourselves In A Room Where The View From The Window Was Of A Wall !  It Is Understood That The Room Was Booked As Having A Courtyard View  But Surely Staring At A Wall Is Hardly A View At All ! We Did Comment On The Situation At Reception  Who Offered To Change The Room  But As We Were Only Staying One Night And Had By Then Unpacked We Declined The Offer.,,,,,
,1201,Experience Was Varied. Check In Process Was Long  One Person On Reception And A Long Queue. Person Who Took Us Down To Our Lodge Was Very Nice. No One Talked To Us About The Layout Of The Castle  Where To Find Things Which I Thought Was Surprising.,,,,,
,1202,Appreciated The Phone Call From Emma At Bovey Castle Prior To Arriving.,,,,,
,1203,Very Impressed By The Contact Made Prior To Our Stay To Arrange Spa Treatments  And Dining Arrangements,,,,,
,1204,Unfortunately The Sat Nav Took Us To The Back Of The Hotel Down A Very Narrow Lane. Signage Could Have Been A Bit Better On The Main Road To Direct You To The Front Of The Hotel. The Welcome Was Extremely Warm And Made Us Relax Instantly,,,,,
,1209,The Reception  Front Desk Personnel Is Outstanding!  Starting With People Like Lucy ... Continuing With Felicity  Vicky  Sammy  Louise  And Others!  The Gentlemen Who Awaited To Greet Us And Take Our Suitcases To Our Room Were Also Amazing!  It Was Incredibly Organized And Well Executed!  Bravo!,,,,,
,1212,Very Friendly Reception By Members Of Staff,,,,,
,1228,Everything Was Easy  Efficient And Welcoming,,,,,
,1233,Staff Showed Great Flexibility When We Asked To Move Rooms,,,,,
,1236,Having Had A Bad Experience At Our Previous Destination On Thursday 15 March It Was Wonderful To Arrive At Bovey Castle And To Your Warm Welcome.,,,,,
,1238,The Welcome Was Disappointing The Member Of Liveried Staff Asked 'Can I Help You' - Which Make One Feel One Is In The Wrong Place - Shouldn't Be There - Rather Than 'How Can I Help You' Which Is More Welcoming Or 'How May I Help You' Or 'Welcome To Bovey' - Which Would Have Been Much Better.,,,,,
,1241,Everything Was Absolutely Fantastic; We Were Made To Feel As If Nothing Was Too Much Effort. All The Staff Were Incredibly Friendly And Welcoming  And Throughout Our Stay We Really Felt As If They Made A Real Effort To Get To Know Us/Make Us Welcome And Feel Like A Really Welcome Part Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,1245,The Luggage Took Some Time To Arrive At Our Room  But We Were Met Very Quickly On Arrival In The Car Park And Warmly Greeted.,,,,,
,1246,The Usual Lovely Greeting On Arrival Had A Phone Call A Few Days Prior To Arrival Asking If They Could Book Any Activities Or Spa Treatments.,,,,,
,1247,I Found An Offer Online And Asked If I Could Use It And The People At Reservation Were Quite Helpful About It.,,,,,
,1249,None Significant,,,,,
,1253,We Were Strongy Welcomed Upon Arrival And Made To Feel At Home Instantly Staff Went Along With 'Surprise',,,,,
,1255,Arrival Was Simple  Friendly And Instructions Were Very Clear. The Reception Staff Made Us Feel Entirely Welcome And At Ease From The Very Beginning.,,,,,
,1257,There Was A Lot Of Hanging Around As We Had Arrived Earlier Than 3:00.,,,,,
,1258,Good Directions,,,,,
,1260,At Our Arrival We Booked A Newspaper (To Have It Delivered) - And We Did Not Get Any -  We Were Not Charged For That And We Stayed Just For 2 Nights - So It Was Not Very Important For Us - Just It Should Not Happen. In General - The Reception Staff Are Very Positive And Friendly.,,,,,
,1262,Reception Seemed Very Busy At Check In & Check Out - Perhaps More Staff Are Needed At Busy Times Or A Separate Check In Desk / Area For Wedding Parties Etc,,,,,
,1264,Great Balance Of Being Left Alone  But Having Someone On Hand As Soon As Required. Well Done Not Many Places Get This Right.,,,,,
,1265,Everything Was First Class  The Very Best We Have Experianced,,,,,
,1267,There Was A Wedding On So Nobody Available To Help Us Unpack The Car And Get It To The Lodge. Not A Major Issue As I Knew Where I Was Going,,,,,
,1269,Need Wifi In Public Areas And Better Cellular Connectivity,,,,,
,1270,We Had A Lovely Time  Just What I Was Looking For  A Local One Night's Stay In A Great Place And Location For My Partners 40Th Birthday.  The Hotel Manager Also Arranged A Cake And Champagne The Next Morning At Breakfast For Myself And My Partner - Great  Thank You,,,,,
,1272,Super Friendly  Extremely Professional And Never Snooty. There Was Always Someone Around If You Needed Anything (Ashley Was Particularly Great).,,,,,
,1274,I Was Disappointed The Champagne And Chocolates I Requested As A Surprise On Arrival For My Wife Were Not In The Room As Requested.  However  The Champagne Was Given At A Later Stage Which Was Nice Of The Staff And Thoughtful.,,,,,
,1275,Pre Arrival Contacted By Lucy - Great Start! Greeted By The Hotel Manager - Lovely Start To Our Stay!,,,,,
,1276,Friendly  Helpful  Efficient :O),,,,,
,1280,We Were Greeted In A Very Friendly Yet Professional Manner By A Gentleman In The Courtyard On Our Arrival  Who Arranged For Our Car To Be Parked And Our Luggage Taken To Our Rooms  We Already Felt Very Welcome And We Had Not Even Got Out Of Our Car.,,,,,
,1281,Rose Cottages Was Painted With Very Dark Colours Which Did Not Appeal To Me.  The Boiler Was Broken So The Central Heating And Hot Water Didn't Work  The Phone Didn't Seem To Work Either,,,,,
,1282,10/10 In Service And Attention To Detail And Overall Welcoming,,,,,
,1289,From Arriving At Your Entrance The Staff Were Incredible! They Were All Incredibly Helpful  Polite And Friendly. I Cannot Fault Anything.,,,,,
,1291,Unfortunately Our Stay Was Marred By An Incident By Other Guest Late At Night. This However  Did Not Deter From The Experience We Enjoyed At The Junior State Suite. We Will Return With A Golfing Party Very Soon.,,,,,
,1292,No One On The Door On Arrival And No Obvious Car Parking Signs So Wasn't Sure Where I Was Supposed To Go Or Do. Just Dumped It Out Front Before Going Through To Reception To Find Out Where I Was Supposed To Park  Where All Became Clear  But A Bit Of A Pain. Told Bags Would Be Brought In When Car Parked But Went To Check On Room Availability After Lunch And They Hadn't - Went And Got Them Myself.,,,,,
,1294,I Had Contacted The Reservation Team Regarding Pony Riding Etc. And They Were Extremely Helpful And Friendly. I Can't Fault Them In Any Way.,,,,,
,1297,We Stayed In A Lodge And Were Unaware That We Couldn't Get To The Lodge To Drop Off And Re-Pack The Car At The End Of The Stay  And Although Your Staff Were Extremely Helpful To Us With Our Luggage We Had A Lot Of Luggage In Smaller Bags (Our Fault) And Would Have Been Good To Know Before Hand,,,,,
,1299,We Were Provided With A Tour Around The Castle When We Arrived Which Made Us Feel Very Welcome And The Little Owl At Reception Made Checking In A Unique Experience!,,,,,
,1303,My Room Did Not Have All The Amenities I Was Told It Did Have. I Could Not Get The Internet To Work - Which As I Was Trying To Conclude Some International Business Was Very Serious. It Took Another Guest To Finally Explain The Quirks Of Your System.....This Applied To Both Paid And Free Services.   I Also Did Not Have A Fridge And The Only Time I Watched The Television The Picture Kept Freezing And Skipping.  In The Case Of My Daughters Room The Bed Was Really Small And Far Too Soft And After 3 Nights Her Back Was Really Sore And She Slept Very Poorly.   For The Price The Beds  Whether Single Or Double  Should Be Perfect.  ,,,,,
,1304,Very Friendly And Welcoming  You Have Selected Good Staff!,,,,,
,1305,Pre-Arrival Email Contact With The Spa Was Prompt  Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,
,1306,We Were Disappointed On Arrival. We Understand That Not All Rooms Can Be Ready Early But We Felt That Our Room Was Not Given The Priority We Were Told It Was Going To Be Given. In Addition  We Felt That Staff Did Not Read The Situation Well - We Only Wanted To Be Able To Change In The Room To Go For A Walk And Would Have Been Happy For The Room To Have Been Completed While We Were Out. We Were Not Given Access To The Room Until 3 Pm (Normal Check-In Time) Despite Having Arrived At Bovey At 11:20 Am. We Ended Up Having To Carry Cases Down To The Pool To Change There And Bring Them Back Up. It Was Not A Good First Experience Of Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,1308,The Staff Were Friendly Efficient And Extremely Helpful  One Could Not Recommend Them Enough,,,,,
,1313,Yes Staff Were Great - Pre Arrival Spa Treatments Were Not Booked As Promised (My Only Complaint!),,,,,
,1316,Being Able To Drive To The Lodge Would Have Made Life A Lot Easier - We Had Help Emptying The Car But It Was Some Distance From The Lodge And I Had To Make Lots Of Return Journeys,,,,,
,1322,As Previously  Arrival Was A Wonderful Experience With The Staff Extremely Attentive And Informative,,,,,
,1323,Pre Booking Of Spa Did Not Happen - My 11 And 2 Oclock Treatments Were Not Booked In Very Disappointing But My Only Complaint Of The Weekend,,,,,
,1324,Very Efficient  And Welcoming,,,,,
,1329,A Call Or Email A Few Days Before Our Stay Would Have Been Nice.  Also As I Booked Online I Did Not Have A Brochure To Look At  The Stay Was A Surprise For My Husband & Would Have Been Helpful. Would Have Been Good To Have Been Made Of Daily Board Activities Ie Wine Tasting  As I Was Not Aware And Per Booked Spa Treatments For The Same Time As Most Activities.,,,,,
,1331,Was Fantastic Staff Were Warm And Helpful,,,,,
,1332,Superb!,,,,,
,1337,1St Class Experience Made Even Better By The Staff In Particular Leah Webber Who Made My Wedding Day Perfect Thank You,,,,,
,1342,When We Arrived The Staff Were Fantastic From Start To Finish,,,,,
,1343,The Tipping Policy Should Have Been Explained On Arrival. I Tipped A Porter As To Me That Is The Way It Is Normally Done However Service Charge Was Then Added On Departure.,,,,,

,1350,As Welcoming As Ever.,,,,,
,1353,Staff Were Very Professional And Friendly From The Start To Finish  It Could Not Have Been Better In Any Way.,,,,,
,1357,First Class In Every Way,,,,,
,1358,The Team Were Busy When We Arrived Trying To Find The Owenr Of A Car  So The Welcome Outside Was Notthe One We Are Familiar With  However The Staff Did Try To Compensate For This. This Is The First Time We Have Taken Our Your Spinger With Us And He Was Made Most Welcome,,,,,
,1360,We Arrived Early And The Weather Was Terrible. It Had Been A Long Drive For Us  And Although This Was Not The Fault Of The Reception Staff  We Were Just Left Hanging Around Till Our Lodge Was Available At 3:30Pm. Eventually  After Having Nothing To Do Or Nowhere To Go  We Got Back In The Car And Went For Yet Another Drive After The 5Hrs Drive We Had Already Done That Day. It Would Have Been Better If We Had Been Made To Feel A Bit More Welcome  Rather Than A In Everyones Way.,,,,,
,1362,Had To Re-Arrange Date Of Stay And The Reservation Staff Were Exceptional.  Whole Experience Was Fantastic And Nothing More Could Have Been Done To Make Our Stay More Enjoyable.,,,,,
,1364,The Staff That I Talked To On The Phone To Make The Booking Were Incredibly Friendly And Helpful,,,,,
,1365,Very Efficient - Calling Us To Book A Table In The Restaurant And Offer Us Spa Appointments,,,,,
,1367,All Lovely,,,,,
,1369,The Spa Staff Were Very Helpful And Efficient At Helping In The Arrangement Of Our Treatments.,,,,,
,1370,Only Positive Things To Say About Your Staff. Well Done!,,,,,
,1371,Before Moving Check That Your Visitor Is Happy And Has All Their Luggage,,,,,
,1372,Don't Change A Thing,,,,,
,1373,None Other Than To Say We Had A Fantastic And Friendly Stay,,,,,
,1374,All Contact  Both Over The Phone And Face-To-Face  Was Excellent,,,,,
,1376,All Staff We Met Greeted Us In The Warmest Welcome Possible.,,,,,
,1377,The Reception Staff Were Efficient But Not Friendly,,,,,
,1378,We Were Greeted At The Entrance To The Hotel Where Our Luggage Was Taken From Our Car And Delivered To Our Room   The Car Was Then Parked For Us. I Had A Phone Call A Few Day's Before We Arrived To Ask If We Wanted Any Extra's Booked.,,,,,
,1379,We Were Not Offered A News Paper In The Morning,,,,,
,1382,The Hotel Tour Was Good And The Guide Offered To Make Us A Cocktail Whilst We Settled In The Lounge - It Was A Nice Touch And Started The Evening Off On The Right Foot.,,,,,
,1383,My Husband And I Experienced The Highest Standard Of Service Levels  The Best In The World; With Special Reference To Federico Aresti And Chris. The Rooms  Breakfast  Pool Area  Fishing And Gardens Were Outstanding And We Are Looking Forward To Visiting Soon Again.,,,,,
,1386,Very Helpful Booking Staff Who Had Noted That It Was My Husbands Birthday Celebration.,,,,,
,1387,Nice Touch With Person On The Door Waiting To Make My Car,,,,,
,1388,I Was Impressed That The Reception Knew It Was My Wives Birthday And Wished Her A Very Happy One.,,,,,
,1389,Brilliant!! Couldn't Fault It.,,,,,
,1393,Cannot Fault - Friendly  Professional Yet Unpretentious.,,,,,
,1397,Guest Services Were Fantastic And A Great Addition To The Experience,,,,,
,1401,Lovely Room And Sweet Gift Of Fudge On Turndown,,,,,
,1404,Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful. We Had A Dog And A Small Baby And The Staff Made The Trip Very Easy By Helping Take All Our Bags Up To The Room And Were Very Helpful All Week,,,,,
,1409,For: Beautiful Hotel In A Beautiful Location.  Reception And Hotel Staff Were Excellent.  Facilities Were Very Good.  Room Rate Was A Special Offer Direct From Bovey Castle  And I Would Stay Again If There Were Future Discount Offers. Against: The Standard Rates Are Very Expensive And I've Stayed In More Luxorious Hotel Rooms (E.G. Thornbury Castle  Castle Combe Manor  Etc.) For Far Less Cost. Overall:  4 Out Of 5 (Lovely But Too Pricey),,,,,
,1412,All Of You Are Very Warm Friendly And Professional. It Cant Get Better Than That!,,,,,
,1413,Very Difficult To Find No Road Signs Would Never Find In Dark Even With Sat Nav,,,,,
,1414,Arriving Early Was Accommodated By Both Your Door / Car Parking & Reception Personnel  We Were Settled In One Of The Lounges & We Enjoyed A Welcome Cup Of Tea Before Being Taken To Our Room @ 14:10Pm,,,,,
,1418,I Would Like To Praise The Ladies On The Phone Pre Arrival. They Were Polite Gentle In Voice And Delt With My Questions Efficently.We Gave Friends The Overnight Stay As A 'Thank You ' Present. I Knew From The First Telephone Contact Staying At Bovey Castle Would Be Perfect.,,,,,
,1419,I Was Expecting To Meet The Exclusive Resorts Concierge But Due To Traffic Delays On The M5 She Had Left When We Arrived  Even Though I Had Telephoned Regarding The Late Arrival. Subsequently No Handover Had Been Arranged Which Was Compounded By The Main Reception Telling Me We Could Drive Up To The Lodge Front Door - Which Was Impossible!  Finally The Hotel Concierge Put Things Right For Which I Was Grateful.,,,,,
,1421,Federico And The Team Were Great To Work With And Made All Our Guests Very Welcome  What A Fantastic Experience!,,,,,
,1423,Staff Were Very Friendly And Accommodating As Always.,,,,,
,1426,All Contact Prior To Arrival Was Prompt And Informative And Our Arrival Was Welcoming.,,,,,
,1427,Very Welcoming And Efficient But Made To Feel Very Much At Home.,,,,,
,1428,Being Met At The Door With Valet Parking Was Not Expected But Very Welcome. Staff Dressed In  Country Uniform Was A Nice Touch They All Looked Very Smart And We're Very Efficient,,,,,
,1429,Appreciated The Call About A Week Before The Stay To Check If We Had Any Particular Needs,,,,,
,1430,Slightly More Detail In Tour   House History   Mobile Phone Hotspot In Bistro (If True Read This Somewhere Else On Our Return),,,,,
,1431,Beautiful Place Made To Feel Very Comfortable  Grounds Kept Well  And Staff Friendly And Helpful.  The Falcon Display In The Morning Added To The Experience.,,,,,
,1433,It Was Lovely To Be Greeted As We Pulled Up In The Car At Bovey Castle. Staff Were More Than Friendly And Really Helped To Make The Experience.,,,,,
,1435,We Were Not Shown Around The Hotel Or Lead To Our Lodge Which Meant We Had To Follow The Map When Looking For The Spa / Restaurants Etc. Reception Also Didnt Give Us A Key So We Had To Walk Back To Get One Once We'd Arrived At The Lodge,,,,,
,1446,Very Helpful Staff And Efficient Staff.,,,,,
,1447,Very Courteous,,,,,
,1448,Mr. Aresti Made Our Arrival Very Easy And Agreable,,,,,
,1449,Although We Arrived Later Than Planned And Missed Our Restaurant Reservation  The Staff Sorted Out A Later Dining Time And Were Most Helpful With Our Luggage,,,,,
,1451,I Really Appreciated Being Contacted By Your Events Team To Look At Arranging Dinner In The Hotel And If I Wanted To Book Any Activities During Our Stay. Never Had This Before From A Hotel!,,,,,
,1452,When We Arrived Our Room Was Not Ready. However We Were Told That Reception Would Let Us Know When It Would Be Ready. We Were Not Advised And Had To Keep Asking Throughout The Afternoon. It Would Have Been Preferable To At Least Have Been Given A Time To Save Us Having To Ask Every Hour Or So.,,,,,
,1453,My Friends And I Booked A 3 Day Break In A Castle Lodge And The Service  Facilities  Cuisine And Location Were Second To None.  It Was My Friends' First Visit To The Castle And They Will Definitely Return With Their Families In The Future.  It Was My Third Visit To Bovey Castle And I Am Never Disappointed.,,,,,
,1460,Everybody Was Smiling.,,,,,
,1462,Valet Parking Confusing As No-One Was Available When We Arrived So We Did Not Know Where Best To Park. Signs Would Be Useful,,,,,
,1464,When I Rang To Make The Reservation The Person I Spoke To Was Very Friendly And Efficient And Instantly E-Mailed Me The Booking Confirmation.  On Arrival At The Hotel The Reception Staff Were Very Welcoming And We Were Kindly Given A Quick Tour Of The Hotel By The Concierge I Think - I'm Afraid I Can't Remember His Name. He Was Extremely Helpful And So Polite And Ensured We Had All The Information We Needed.  We Were Blown Away By The Beauty And Grandeur Of The Hotel When We Arrived!,,,,,
,1472,We Stayed In One Of The Lodges (Hound Tor) Which Isn't Very Well Placed For Car Access. We Were Blocking Access To Other Lodges While We Unloaded / Loaded And Did Have To Move To Allow Another Party To Return Their Car To The Carpark.  Some Sort Of Trolley To Carry Our Luggage Would Have Been Wonderful  We Would Happily Have Used That Instead Of Bringing The Car To The House.,,,,,
,1473,All Dealings That We Had With The Staff From The Initial Call (Early Morning On The Day That We Wanted To Stay!) And When We Arrived At The Hotel Were Excellent.,,,,,
,1475,A Request Made Prior To Arrival Was Actioned But It Would Have Been Nice To Receive An Email Confirming.,,,,,
,1477,We Could Not Have Had A Nicer Start To Our Honeymoon. Every Staff Member We Came Into Contact With Exceeded Our Expectations,,,,,
,1482,Best Preparation  Greetings And Service. Per-Arrival  Both By Email And Phone I Managed To Get All Queries Sorted And Surprise Arrangements Organised.,,,,,
,1485,My Bags Took 1 And Half Hours To Be Brought To My Room.  This Was Only After I Called Reception.,,,,,
,1488,On Arrival All Staff Were Very Professional  Very Helpful And Could Not Of Done Any More To Help. ,,,,,
,1490,Excellent  Welcoming  Smart And Well Dressed And Very Pleasant Staff Enjoyed Our Tour Of The Hotel And It Was Very Informative X,,,,,
,1492,We Were Greeted By A Number Of Members Of Staff Who Were Very Friendly And Welcoming.,,,,,
,1494,The Staff (And Management) Were Wonderful - They Were Very Attentive And Always Found A Solution To Our Requests. I Like The Philosophy Of Frederico - To Paraphrase 'I Like To Say Yes'  And The Bc Team Did Just That.,,,,,
,1495,A Warm Welcome By Federico And The Reception Staff,,,,,
,1500,Staff Very Friendly  But Not Efficient,,,,,
,1501,Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful As This Was Our First Stay At The Hotel We Were Offered And Accepted A Guided Tour.,,,,,
,1504,We Did Not Initially Get Allocated A Room On The Side Of The Hotel We Had Originally Booked With Leanne  This Matter Was Quickly Rectified By Frederico And We Were Very Pleased With Room 04,,,,,
,1507,Where To Park / Pull In On Arrival Was Ver Unclear  Ended Up Driving Around A Little Lost,,,,,
,1509,My Only Complaint Was That Everyone Was Very Focused On The Big Group That Was Staying There At The Same Time As We Were  We Felt A Bit Second Rate  Not Quite As Important As The Big Group And The Wedding That Was Coming In.,,,,,
,1511,Everyone Was Very Helpful Especially With The Children,,,,,
,1513,Julia Was Outstanding And Very Helpful To Us,,,,,
,1516,This Is The 3Rd Time That I Have Stayed At Bovey Castle And Thoroughly Enjoyed The Experience Once Again.,,,,,
,1517,All The Staff Were Very Welcoming And We Felt Our Holiday Started The Second We Stepped Out Of Our Car.  Our Luggage Was Taken Care Of Along With The Dog's Basket And Our Car.,,,,,
,1518,Excellent Service From Rebecca In Reservations  Chatty And Friendly But Professional,,,,,
,1519,Immediately Felt Relaxed And Welcome.  The Staff Were Helpful  Encouraging And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble...! Restaurant Was Fabulous And A Very Relaxing Atmosphere!,,,,,
,1521,Pre Arrival Everything Went Smoothly. Everyone Was Very Helpful Taking The Luggage And Golf Clubs  Parking The Car  Registering Was Uncomplicated And We Were Shown To Our Rooms.,,,,,
,1522,I Booked The Trip But My Wife Took A Phone Call From You Pre. Our Visit  But  If The Visit Had Been A Surprise For Her  It Would Have Been Spoilt......Suggest You Send The Party Who Books An Email To Confirm Arrangements Etc.,,,,,
,1523,Made To Feel Very Welcome - Very Efficent On My Inquires Via Email Pre Arrival,,,,,
,1524,I'm A Part-Time Travel Writer And I'd Say The Experience Was Top-Notch.  For Additional Comments  See My Tripadvisor Review (By Stormfever  March Stay),,,,,
,1525,No It's All Good - A High Standard Of Professionalism...,,,,,
,1526,The Staff Who Picked Us Up By Bus From Exeter Are Very Friendly And Accommodating. It Was A Very Nice Welcome Surprise For Which I Thank You Very Much.,,,,,
,1531,The Reservation Staff Were Very Professional And Helpful In Particular Donna.,,,,,
,1535,Great Service As Usual  Loved The Visit. Will Come Back Again Soon And For Longer,,,,,
,1537,The Lodge Was Lovely And Warm. Someone Had Been In To Put The Fire On And Make Sure The Lights Were On.,,,,,
,1546,Everything Was Perfect  Except That The Eastern European Service Staff Do Not Reach The Fine Standard In Language Or Tradition E.G. Of Serving English Tea. A High Standard Is One Reason To Chose This Hotel For Vacation. The Room Was Very Clean Every Day. We Are Looking Forward To Our Next Stay.,,,,,
,1549,No,,,,,
,1551,I Tried Calling A Few Times Before Arrival  To Confirm My Reservation  Each Time I Called I Was Put Through To The Reservations Team And Never Got Through Just An Answer Machine. Other Than That Everything Was Great.,,,,,
,1552,Greeted As We Parked And Luggage Taken To Our Room Without Any Hassle  Excellent.  Check In Was Quick And Easy Without Fuss  Again Excellent.,,,,,
,1553,A Very Friendly And Hospitable Welcome.,,,,,
,1555,Our Room Wasn't Ready At 3Pm As I Believe Housekeeping Were Looking For A Teacup So We Had To Wait Until This Was Located.,,,,,
,1557,We Arrived At 1.30Pm  And The Room Wasn't Ready Until 3.30Pm...We Had A Lovely Walk Around The Grounds Though And The Mini Tour Was Very Helpful,,,,,
,1562,Very Welcoming Thoroughly Perfect,,,,,
,1563,Staff Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,
,1567,Catherine Very Lovely And Helpful With All My Questions On Pre-Booking.  Arrival Staff Very Helpful And Professional.,,,,,
,1570,I Was Uncertain Where To Park On Arrival As Large Areas Coned Off At Main Entrance. Eventually Parked Some Distance Away. Once At Reception Staff Were Friendly And Welcoming And The Checking In Process Was Swift And Efficient. Making Our Booking On The Phone Was Easy And Pleasant With No Issues At All.,,,,,
,1575,The Contact I Had With The Resort Team Prior To Arrival  By Email.  Left Me Feeling Confident That Everything Was In Hand And Under Control.  There Was A Little Confusion With The Audi Vehicles In The Drive  But It Did Not Have An Adverse Effect On Our Arrival.,,,,,
,1579,On Arrival We Were Shown To Our Lodge - The Gas Fire Was Alight. It Would Be Good To Have A Short Run Through On How To Turn It Off Without Having To Search For Information.  Thank You For The Milk/Bread/Butter Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,1581,Valet Parking Made Me Feel Very Special!,,,,,
,1582,Room Not Ready Until 3  Which Meant Hanging Around In The Bar To Wait. Not A Problem  And We Were Warned. But 3 Is A Little Late  Most Hotels Have Rooms Ready By 2.,,,,,
,1584,Everything Was Just Perfect And I Felt Like Coming Home !!!  Well Done !!!,,,,,
,1585,All Staff Were Very Helpful And Friendly And Federico Is The Hardest Working Hotel Manager I Have Ever Met.,,,,,
,1586,See Back,,,,,
,1588,Reception Staff Very Helpful In Keeping Our Visit A Surprise For My Wife.  Thank You.,,,,,
,1589,Excellent!  Received A Phone Call Prior To Our Arrival Asking In We Needed Anything And As Usual  Our Welcome From Fed And His Team Was Warm And Welcoming.  So Helpful - Nothing Is Too Much Trouble.  Fed Always Remembers Us And Makes Us Feel At Home  The Instant We Arrive.  Thank You Again!,,,,,
,1590,No,,,,,
,1592,Having Been Collected By Car  The Driver Was Excellent  Professuional And Friendly.  On Arrival  The Well Presented Staff Took Care Of My Baggage And Guidance To Reception Impeccably.  First Impressions Count For A Lot And The Staff Were Instantly Warm  Friendly And Courteous.,,,,,
,1594,Staff Really Couldn't Do Enough To Help!,,,,,
,1597,Getting Through To Reception From An External Number Can Be Difficult,,,,,
,1598,Whole Experience From Arrival To Departure Was Excellent. All Staff That We Had Contact With Were Very Welcoming And Helpful.,,,,,
,1600,We Were Told That Rooms/Lodges Would Be Ready For A 3Pm Arrival However Our Lodge Was Not Ready And We Had To Wait Until 4Pm  The Wait Was Made Pleasurable By Afternoon Tea Being Served But We Did Have A Fifteen Month Old Baby With Us And It Would Have Been Good To Have Gained Access To Our Lodge On Time.,,,,,
,1601,No,,,,,
,1603,No  Everything Was Exceptional,,,,,
,1606,It Was Great To Be Greeted By Frederico  So Friendly But Yet So Professional. That Combined With A Great Team Supporting Him Makes For A Perfect Combination.,,,,,
,1607,Everything Is Always Made Very Easy  The Routine Allowed Us To Start Our Break From Stepping Out Of Our Vehicle. Louise Ensured The Whole Trip Ran Like Clock Work From Moment One For Us And All Our Guests.,,,,,
,1608,Just Fabulous - Staff So Attentive,,,,,
,1609,There Was A Good Feeling From The Moment We Arrived In The Car Park Which Was Most Appreciated After A Long Drive.,,,,,
,1610,Mat Was Very Helpful,,,,,
,1615,Very Helpful Staff  Pre Arrival Was Very Good Too.,,,,,
,1618,Upgraded Room On Arrival Was A Lovely Surprise,,,,,
,1620,Receptionist Engaged In Long And Apprently Private Conversation While We Waited To Check In. Bill Wrong At The End,,,,,
,1623,Booked A Sunday Lunch In February  For Sunday 18Th March  Didnt Realise At Time It Was Mothers Day And Was Never Told Had An Extra Â£14 On Price Off Meal Per Person Until We Sat Down At Table In Front Off Friends And Was Om Menu. Would Have Been Nice To Be Told  Will Be Writing My Opion On Trip Advisor  Service Was Slow Too  Did Not Charge For Beers We Had To Ask Twice For But Did Add Service Charge Too,,,,,
,1625,Made To Feel Welcome From Arrival To Check Out.,,,,,
,1627,Everything Was So Effortless Which Made The Booking Process So Good,,,,,
,1628,The Pre Arrival Contact Was A Nice Touch. Friendly Service From Reception Team.,,,,,
,1630,We Felt Very Welcome & Were Put At Ease Straight Away. This Meant Our Break Started From The Point We Walked Through The Door-Thank You!,,,,,
,1631,Really Lovely Staff  Particularly The Hotel Manager And The Cider Making!!,,,,,
,1632,Most Welcoming Arrival  Felt Right At Home,,,,,
,1638,Very Helpful Staff Via Email And Phone.  Hugely Impressed,,,,,
,1639,Hugely Friendly And Personal Staff. Love The Fact That They Have Are Not Only Polite  But All Have Own Personalities. Everything Ws Made Very Easy.,,,,,
,1643,Cannot Speak Highly Enough About Ever Member Of Staff - So Polite And Could Not Do Enough To Help - Brilliant,,,,,
,1645,We Were Given A Piece Of Paper Explaining Use Of Safe But On Arrival In Room No Safe And Also Had A Cupboard Pointed Out To Us That There Was A Fridge In It But No Fridge! Very Sloppy For A 5 Star Establishment.,,,,,
,1652,Meet & Greet Was Excellent  As Was The Pre-Tour ( Our Room Was Not Ready).,,,,,
,1655,When I Made Our Reservation For 'Mid-Week Madness' For A Family Of Four  I Was Told We Would Have Rooms With A View.  'All Rooms Have A View'.  We Were Initially Put In Two Adjoining Rooms (At Booking I Was Told There Were No Adjoining Left  -- Which I Was Fine With) That Overlooked The Bicycle Parking Area And The Front Car Park.  My Boys Opened Their Window To The Kitchen Fan Blasting Meat Fumes About 10 Feet Away.  I Went To The Front Desk And Asked To Be Moved.  After 1.5 Hours Sitting Have Tea -- Which Follwed On To A 4 Hour Drive From London -- We Were Shown 3 Alernative Room Options.  They Were Ok.  Our New Room Had Obviously Had Leaks And Paint Was Peeling Off The Windows.  But -- The View Was Lovely.  Why Did It Take Soooooooooo Lonnnngggggg??????? We Were Exhausted.  The Two Rooms We Had Initially Were Completely Unacceptable.  If I Was Not Allowed To Move I Would Have Left The Hotel.  If I Recommend Bovey Castle To Anyone I Will Tell Them To Be Very Specific About Room Type And What Side Of The Castle It Is On.  ,,,,,
,1658,No Barcardi In The Edwarian Grill And Ran Out If Rump At 8.00 Not Good,,,,,
,1663,The Staff Were Amazing And So Helpful  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,1664,We Brought Out Little Puppy Lexi With Us. She Has A Twitter Account And It Was Really Nice Of Bovey To Send Her A Tweet Before Our Arrival To Say They Were Looking Forward To Meeting Her.,,,,,
,1665,The Major Issue Was Being Made To Wait For The Room To Be Ready Upon Arrival And The Main Receptionist Not Seemimg To Think This Was A Matter Of Urgency. We Were Kept Waiting Right Up Untill 3.00Pm,,,,,
,1670,Excellent,,,,,
,1673,The Reception Were Very Helpful And Could Not Have Been More Welcoming,,,,,
,1674,Excellent Service,,,,,
,1675,Staff All Good. But We Were Given Some Info Telling Us How We Should Use Our Room Safe For Valuables. There Was No Room Safe! Also  There Were No Bath Robes.,,,,,
,1677,Very Pushy And Insensitive Welcoming Staff,,,,,
,1678,Please Do Not Put Me In Room 21 Again. We Seem To Be In That Room Every Time We Stay And I Would Like A Room With A Bath.,,,,,
,1681,Craig Was Excellent - He Looked After 6 Kids For Archery And Survival Skills.  Of The Four Activities These Were The Most Popular,,,,,
,1683,Bovey Worked With My Travel Agent To Make Recreation Arrangement In Advance Of Our Stay Which Was Fantastic And Saved Time When We Arrived.,,,,,
,1685,All Very Good,,,,,
,1688,A Little Confused At What Was Happening On Arrival  When Got Out Of Car (Re Parking). Would Have Apporeciated A Brief Explanation First Rather Than Expecting Me To Hand Over Car Keys Without A Word And Assuming We Know What's Happening (Even Though Am A Seasoned Traveler!).,,,,,
,1692,It Was Difficult To Make A Reservation. The Extension To Reservation Rang Several Times And Went To Voice Mail. I Left A Message But The Call Was Not Returned. Then Spoke To The Front Desk About The Issue Who Assured Me They Passed The Message On To Reservations Several Times To Return My Call To No Avail. This Started From Around 3Pm. This Finally Got Resolved At About 9Pm When The Same Staff At He Front Desk Took The Book And Once Again Reassured Me Reservations Would Call In The Am To Confirm Always Well. No Call Was Received. There Was Much Anxiety As We Departed London At 5Am To Drive Down Not Knowing If We Had A Reservation Or Not. In The End It All Worked But Could Be Avoided By Better Customer Service From The Reservations Team.,,,,,
,1693,I Liked The Fact That The Door Staff Were Unassuming And Treated Us The Same As Anyone Else Arriving In Their Far Superior Cars!,,,,,
,1697,The Questions Above Ask About Professionalism And Friendliness.  Based On My Experience Of This Visit I Would Say That The Staff Achieved Both To A High Degree.  In Other Hotels I've Experienced Professionalism But Which Has Been A Little 'Cold'  Other Times Friendliness But In The Context Of Less-Then-Excellent Professionalism/Other Standards.  Well Done.,,,,,
,1700,One Of The Nicest Welcomes I've Received At A Hotel  - All Staff Were Courteous And Engaging.   It Was Great To See English Staff With Smiles On Their Faces!   The Quick Guided Tour Was Also A Lovely Touch,,,,,
,1702,Not Clear Where We Could Park But Probably Should Have Left It To The Staff - Not Aware That Was On Offer As Not A Regular Attendee At This Level Of Wonderful Service!,,,,,
,1708,Our Desire/Need For Valet Parking Was Not Enquired At The Point Of Registration  So Although We Arrived For Our Golf Which Was Booked Prior To A Time When The Room Was (Reasonably) Not Available  The Opportunity To Take Our Luggae To Our Room Whilst We Were On The Course Was Missed.,,,,,
,1709,All Email And Phone Inquiries Were Handled Promptly.,,,,,
,1711,When We Got Into The Lodge  There Were No Essentials (Bread  Milk Etc)  Which Had Been The Case On Previous Visits. This Made It Very Awkward  As We Arrived Late In The Afternoon On Boxing Day And Therefore Had No Opportunity To Get Provisions For The Evening Or Next Morning. When I Queried This At Reception (Twice)  Sarah Did Not Seem To Know Whether Or Not This Was Right At Didn't Seem (I'm Sorry To Say) Particularly Bothered. I Had To Go Back & Ask Again Later. At This Point Louise Came Up (As She Recognised Us) And Said She Would Look Into It. She Duly Rang The Lodge Shortly Afterwards And Offered Us Breakfast In The Bistro The Next Morning  Compliments Of Federico.,,,,,
,1713,Valet Parking Excellent And Luggage Delivery.  Very Busy For You As A Wedding On And We Were Wedding Guests But Felt Valet Parking Very Stress Free.,,,,,
,1714,We Were Greeted At The Door And Our Luggage Dealt With Quickly. Our Room Was Ready Early And We Were Checked In  Un Packed In Having Lunch Within 15 Minutes Of Arriving! Fantastic,,,,,
,1716,Excellent All Round,,,,,
,1720,Was Quite Hard To Get Through To Reservations - Took Ages To Return Calls Etc  Not That Efficient.,,,,,
,1728,We Could Not Fault Our Welcome. The Guys From The Pro Shop Were Extremely Helpful.,,,,,
,1736,No,,,,,
,1741,Reception Staff Were Very Helpful With The Upgrade  However  The Meet & Greet Was Not As Attentive As On Previous Visits.  It Was Fortunate That We Know Bovey Well When We Arraived.,,,,,
,1743,Staff Have Exactly The Right Attitude And Were Very Proud To Show The Hotel's Facilities,,,,,
,1745,Great First Impression  Particularly As It Was Pouring With Rain.,,,,,
,1747,Couldn't Book Golf Prior To Arrival  Answer Machine  Left Message But No Call Back. Didn't Matter As Easy On The Day,,,,,
,1748,Polly Gave Us A Great Welcome & Showed Us Round. A Great Start.,,,,,
,1753,It Was Easy   And Felt Like You Were Expecting Us And Prepared For Our Stay.,,,,,
,1767,No Comments  Just Compliments.,,,,,
,1768,As A Repeat Customer I Would Have Expected To Be Noticed As Such...,,,,,
,1770,Excellent  Could Not Fault The Welcome.,,,,,
,1773,It Was Excellent,,,,,
,1775,Two Single Beds To Create A Double Was Very Disappointing,,,,,
,1777,All The Staff Were Exceptionally Friendly And Helpful And Reassuringly Normal( Not Obsequious At All). The Manager  Frederico  Was   Without Question  The Most Visible And Friendly Hotel Manager I Have Come Across And Made Our Stay Truly Special,,,,,
,1778,None,,,,,
,1780,No,,,,,
,1781,We Were Impressed By The Way Our Golf Kit Was Transferred To The Golf Shop And It Was Ready For Us To Use As Soon As We Had Checked In.,,,,,
,1782,We Thought The Car Parking Service Was Excellent.  Pre Arrivl Contact Was Frustrating.  I Had A Message Left At Home Re Making Pre Visit Bookings/Dinner/Spa Etc.  Took Days To Get Through And Speak To Someone With My Requests.,,,,,
,1783,We Had Been Allocated Room 19 & We Asked About A Room Facing The Countryside. The Reception Staff Were Very Helpful And Found A Room On The 3Rd Floor - Unfortunately This Was An Attic Room (Albeit With A Fabulous Bathroom) And The Atmosphere Was Stiflingly Hot And Stuffy  So We Reverted To Room 19,,,,,
,1785,Chaotic Arrival. Room Not Ready At 3Pm. We Were Offered Tea In The Bar Which Never Arrived  And We Were Not Told When The Room Was Ready. I Had To Return To Reception To Ascertain That The Room Was Ready  And There Was A Distinct Lack Of Communication And Efficiency.,,,,,
,1786,Unfortunately Your Staff Called Our House Landline Number To Let Us Know About Booking For Dinner Because You Get Very Busy In The Restaurant And Left A Message.  This Was Of No Use To Us As We Were Already Away.  Perhaps They Could Make A Note To Use A Mobile Telephone In Future.  We Were Therefore Unable To Get Into The Restaurant On Either Night And Had To Use The Bistro Which Does Not Come Up To Expectations Of A 5 Star Hotel.,,,,,
,1787,All Communication With The Hotel Was Excellent - E Mails Were Answered Promptly And Reassuringly.,,,,,
,1788,It Helped A Lot To Deal With A Single Named Person In The Booking Process (Polly),,,,,
,1789,Thanks Again For Sending Driver To Exeter Airport. He Was A Charming Fellow,,,,,
,1791,We Were Not Told When Room Was Ready And When It Was Took Long Time For Luggage To Arrive In Room.,,,,,
,1796,Friendly And Helpful Welcome,,,,,
,1801,I Have To Say That I Do Not Appreciate Valet Parking. When We Returned To Get Something From The Car (In Pouring Rain) Using Our Spare Key The Car Was Not Where The Valet Had Originally Parked It.,,,,,
,1802,Staff Wre Efficient And Friendly,,,,,
,1804,Golf Staff Very Helpful.,,,,,
,1805,None,,,,,
,1806,Well Played Archimedes!  Or Was It Aristotle!,,,,,
,1807,There Is Nothing  Can Add Other Than What A Lovely Time We Had.,,,,,
,1810,Everything Was Perfect!,,,,,
,1813,All Excellent As Always!,,,,,
,1818,On Arrival My Room Was Not Allocated So I Had Lunch At The Hotel. I Was Then Shown To My Room But Had To Wait 5 Minutes For My Luggage. I Had Explained I Needed It As I Was Attending A Dental Photography Course That Was About To Start. Apparently It Was Due To The Hotel Being Rather Busy. My Wife Later   Whilst I Was On The Photography Course In Your Hotel Found She Could Not Get Back In The Room And Waited At Reception For Almost 10 Minutes For Someone To Help Her And Walk With Her To The Room To Let Her In. It Seems She Had Been Forgotten As Initially It Was Reported By Reception  But As It Was Busy Around There  She Waited Patiently At The Side Of The Desk But Was Kept Waiting Too Long In Our Opinion.,,,,,
,1819,All Excellent Especially The Young Gentleman Who Asisted With Our Luggage,,,,,
,1823,My Husband And I Were After Abit Of 'Me' Time Away From The Kids - We Definately Found It! Frederico And His Staff Were Wonderful In Arrival We Were Given A Room With A Radiaror Not Working And There Seemed To Be A Noise Over It - Heater? We Were Given Another Room Staright Away - Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.Thankyou.,,,,,
,1825,On A Sunday Lunch Time We Waited Both To Have Drinks Order Taken And For Them To Arrive Before Sunday Lunch ( Not During This Stay)  The Waiter For These Drinks On 28Th April Did Not Seem To Fit Your 5 Star Hotel.,,,,,
,1826,All Contact With The Castle Prior To My Visit Which I Did By Both Phone And Email Were Quickly Responded To  Were Very Helpful And Positive And Were The Human 'Touches' That Make All The Difference. The Arrival Was Easy. A Warm Welcome Awaited Us And We Knew What To Do And Where To Go At Once. Help Was Offered At Every Turn And All Staff Were Friendly And Interested.,,,,,
,1831,There Was Quite A Bit Of Chaos Due A Wedding The Previous 2 Days.  Staff Were Not As Attentive As I Would Have Liked.,,,,,
,1832,It Was A Wonderful Experience To Arrive And Be So Warmly Welcomed.....,,,,,
,1837,Our Luggage Took A Long Time To Arrive At Our Rooms,,,,,
,1847,Given That We Were A Hen Party And We Had Booked Through The Events Manager  It Would Have Been Good To Have Had A Room With Twin Beds Set Up. The Receptionist Was Very Nice And Asked Us What Would Be Better  Which Was Good  But She Seemed A Little Bit Stressed And Flustered When We Said We Would Prefer A Twin. She Was Really Eager To Help  Which Was Great  But A Little More Training May Help The Impression Given. Rooms Were Ready  Which Was Nice And Someone Greeted Us When We Arrived In Our Car And Took Our Luggage Up To Our Room Very Promptly.,,,,,
,1848,We Were Never Asked If The Booking's For A Special Occassion If We Did Then Maybe You Guys Would Have Been Able To Provide A Bit More Personalised Touch,,,,,
,1850,Good To Receive A Call To Make Dinner Reservations Etc.,,,,,
,1856,Frederico And His Staff Set A Benchmark For Other Hotels To Follow - Faultless Attention To Detail,,,,,
,1861,The Whole Checkin Was Great  From Carrying The Bags Up To The Room For Us And Being Escorted To The Room.,,,,,
,1867,Fantastic !!!,,,,,
,1868,I Loved The Phone Call I Received The Day Before To See If There Was Anything Else We Needed Or That Could Be Done For Us Upon Our Arrival.,,,,,
,1869,On Previous Arrivals We Have Been Greeted At Our Car And Baggage Taken In  On This Occasion This Was Not The Case.  It Was A Surprise Visit For My Husbands Birthday  He Commented That Maybe It Was Due To This Being A Midweek Visit And Our Previous Visits Had Been At Weekends.  I Also Wanted To Surprise Him With Some Shooting But The Activities Team Advised The Gentleman Was On A Day Off  However An Alternative Day Was Not Offered.  In Our Room We Didn't Receive The Usual Bovey Biscuits With The Beverages.  Only Little Things But Sometimes It's The Little Extra Service That Shows Bovey Exceeds Expectations Rather Than Meeting Them.  We Love Bovey And Will Return To Hopefully The Standard We Are Used To.  On A Positive Note The Staff Were All Very Polite And Helpful And We Did Enjoy Our Stay.,,,,,
,1872,Lovely To Be Shown Around Before Going To Room,,,,,
,1873,We Mentioned The Room Number We Had Previously Stayed In And The Receptionist Offered To Upgrade Us For This Stay As The Hotel Was Fairly Quiet. This Was Much Appreciated As We Were Quite Prepared To Stay In The Room Allocated To Us.,,,,,
,1875,All Pre Arrival Contact Was Efficient And Friendly. Our Arrival At The Hotel Was Outstanding  The Young Man That Welcomed Us And Offered A Tour Of The Hotel Was Terrific  If Only All Hotels Would Offer A Welcome Of This Calibre  Truely Top Class Hospitality,,,,,
,1876,The Hotel Manager Federico Aresti Made The Whole Experience Out Of This World.  Our Daughter Said It Was One Of The Best Birthdays She Has Ever Had.  Absolutely Nothing To Complain About And Believe Me I Tend To Complain A Lot.  I Am Very Difficult To Please Because I Travel So Much.  5 Stars!,,,,,
,1877,Very Friendly Atmosphere - Especially Loved The Owl At Reception,,,,,
,1879,I Enjoyed Having Someone Show Us The Key Features. Having This Followed By Complimentary Tea/Coffee Might Be Something To Consider As A Way Of Completing The Experience.,,,,,
,1881,Lovely Warm Welcome. Staff Most Accomodating. They Were Happy For Us To Upgrade Our Room.,,,,,
,1885,Only That We Missed The Bottle Of  Presecco By Booking A Day Late!!,,,,,
,1889,Having The Car Parked For Us Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1890,When Booking By Phone Was Not Asked Which Restaurant We Wished To Dine In And Automatically Booked In The Bistro.,,,,,
,1891,I Telephoned To Request An Upgrade The Day Before We Arrived  And Was Informed It Had Already Been Done...Think I Mentioned When Checking Booking That We Would Prefer A Twin And Quiet Room  And That It Had Been Done As A Surprise  Which Was Extremely Thoughtful,,,,,
,1892,I Was Contacted As Soon As I Had Made My Booking To Organise Spa Treatments And This Was Very Efficient Making My Experience More Relaxed As I Did Not Have To Organise These Separately.,,,,,
,1893,All The Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful,,,,,
,1895,The Staff Were Very Friendly And Welcoming.,,,,,
,1899,Lovely To Be Met By A Friendly Face Before We Had Even Got Out Of The Car!,,,,,
,1900,No.,,,,,
,1901,As I Had Meetings In Helston  Cornwall My Partner Was Able To Use The Spa Facilities From 9.30Am On Our Arrival  Which She Enjoyed And I Wa Sable To Meet Up With Her Later That Day.  We Used The Spa Facilities The Following Morning And Where Not Put Under Any Pressure To Vacate Bovey Castle.  Thank You For A Super Time.  Stewart Joyner,,,,,
,1906,Everything Was Ready For My Arrival And Check In Very Easy,,,,,
,1907,An Amazing Experience  One I Will Never Forget. The Manager And Staff Made Me And My Partner Feel So Welcome. Thank You For A Beautiful Stay.,,,,,
,1908,The Young Man At The Front Entrance Could Have Directed Us To A Parking Space  So We Knew We Were In A Suitable Parking Spot  As The Cars Parked Looked To Us  As New Arrivals To Be In No Order.,,,,,
,1909,A Member Of Your Staff Wanted Me To Prove In Writing That I Had Been Offered A Valley View Room  By Your Reservations Department At The Tiem Of Booking.  I Was Disappointed To Have My Honesty Questioned  But As The Lady Who Took My Booking Was Not Available I Was Unable To Confirm What I'd Been Offered Over The Phone.  I Was Very Pleased With The Room  However Very Disapointed That I Was Being Asked To Prove In Writing That I Had Been Offered A Valley View Room  At The Time Of Making My Reservation.  Hence We Were Not Given The Valley View Room As Agreed When I Made The Reservation (Which Was The Day Before I Had Arrived At Your Hotel).,,,,,
,1910,Dinner Staff Where Not As Friendly As The Other Staff!,,,,,
,1914,Very Efficient Service,,,,,
,1918,My Wife Booked Spa Treatments That Were Supposed To Be Confirmed Via Email Prior To Our Arrival  This Email Did Not Arrive.  All Other Booking Confirmations Were Received And The Experience Over The Phone Was Very Pleasant And Helpful.  We Did Receive A Call The Day After Booking To Enquire If We Required Any Spa Treatments Or Other Excursions  Although I Am Aware This Is An 'Upsell' Tactic It Did Still Feel Personal.,,,,,
,1920,I Have Stayed In A Lot Of Hotels And I Have To Say That The Reception Staff And The Doormen/Valets Are Amongst The Most Professional That I Have Come Across. In A Lot Of Places  The Team Is Professional  But At Bovey Castle The Team Appear To Really Enjoy Their Jobs. Nothing Is Too Much Trouble - They Are Extremely Helpful And Exude A Warmth And Welcome Which Makes The First Impression A Positive One.,,,,,
,1921,The Overall Experience Was Excellent And We Would Love To Come Back And Stay Longer Next Time,,,,,
,1923,We Really Enjoyed Our Stay With You The Staff Were Very Friendly & Helpful & Made Us Feel Very Welcome,,,,,
,1925,Staff Couldn't Have Been Friendlier Or More Welcoming.  It Was Amazing.,,,,,
,1926,Amazing Individualised Service Pre Arrival And On Arrival.,,,,,
,1927,Excellent  Friendly Staff,,,,,
,1928,Very Friendly  Helpful  Professional Staff.,,,,,
,1929,I Had Initially Booked A Spa Break And Provisionally Booked A Time For A Mini Treatment In The Spa But Then Changed My Booking To Just Dinner  Bed And Breakfast And Was Told That The Treatment Would Be Cancelled But Unfortunately Wasn't So I Was Asked A Couple Of Times After The Treatment Time If I Would Like To Rebook.,,,,,
,1934,The Chocolates I'd Ordered For In The Room On Our Arrival Were Not There. Recepetion Corrected This Once Informed,,,,,
,1936,On Arrival Asked To Order Coffee Waited For 20Mins For Someone To Take Order. In The End Found Bistro And Ordered My Own. Not A Great Start To Our Stay,,,,,
,1937,Very Homely & Friendly A Lovely Way To Start Your Stay,,,,,
,1942,You Upgraded Us As It Was My Wife's Birthday  This Was Excellent And Made Her Day!,,,,,
,1947,Staff To Be Commended On Friendly Warm  Welcome Made Us Feel Expected And Wanted,,,,,
,1949,Smooth And Without Fuss,,,,,
,1958,We Has Very Good Email Correspondence Before Hand To Book Things.,,,,,
,1972,No,,,,,
,1974,Blissful Experience,,,,,
,1976,All Excellent,,,,,
,1982,I Really Enjoyed My Stay At Bovey. I Have Recommended It Already To 2 Family Members And Several Friends. The Meal We Had In The Restaurant Was Possibly One Of The Best I Have Ever Had And The Service At All Times Was Exemplary.,,,,,
,1988,Very Expensive. A Little Formal.,,,,,
,1989,Perhaps The Kids Club Could Be Inclusive In The Hotel Rates As The Activities Were Of Mixed Interest To Our Daughter So She Would Have Only Wished To Be At One Of These And Not Part Of Others But We Were Not Able To Just Pick The One Activity That Interested Her. Really Liked The Way The Hotel Had Several Pets That I Think Really Works Well. A Place Like Bovey Needs To Feel Homely To Get People Coming Back And I Think You Had The Right Balance.,,,,,
,1993,I Had Such A Lovely Stay. It's Such A Beautiful Hotel And Location  And I Was Made To Feel Really Special,,,,,
,1995,The Staff Were Excellent  Attentive Did Everything Possible To Help Us Enjoy Our Stay.,,,,,
,2000,It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Brief Tour Around The Key Facilities (Dining Hall  Bar  Spa Etc).....,,,,,
,2004,There Was No Porter At The Main Reception When We First Pulled In With The Car,,,,,
,2008,Spoke To Donna Before Arrival To Arrange Birthday Cake And Also To Advise Of Daughters But Allergy -Everything Was Efficient And Perfectly Arranged Before We Arrived And During Our Stay.,,,,,
,2010,All Good,,,,,
,2011,We Were Immediately The Chance To Pay For A Room Upgrade. Whilst Possibly Good Sales Technique / Business Sense  It Did However Put A Seed Of Doubt In Our Minds That We Might Not Have Booked A Good Enough Room,,,,,
,2012,Front Desk Was Not Up To Standard But They Tried Hard.,,,,,
,2014,Excellent,,,,,
,2017,The Entire Hotel Team  On The Telephone And In Person  Provided An Excellent Experience,,,,,
,2019,Made To Feel Very Welcome On Arrival -  Staff Were Most Helpful And Extremely Pleasant And Polite,,,,,
,2020,Although It Was Lovely To Be Shown Around The Various Lounges And Restaurants  We Already Had Reservations For The Bistro (Meal Deal) So Didn't Really Want To Hear About The Menu In The Edwardian  I Feel The Guided Tour Was A Little Too Long As We Were Keen To See The Room. The Was Very Polite  Chatty And Friendly Though So Only A Tiny Little Moan.,,,,,
,2022,We Were Very Impressed By Our Greeting.We Were Shown Where To Leave Our Luggage Safely Then Shown Around The Hotel By Heather Who Was Very Happy And Helpful.,,,,,
,2023,Nothing Was Too Much Trouble  Felt Very Welcome.,,,,,
,2026,Katherine In Reservations Was Very Helpful And Being Shown Around The Hotel On Arrival Was A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,2030,So Warmly Welcomed By A Male Staff Member(Cant Remember His Name) He Was So Informative And Showed Us Around  Very Professional.,,,,,
,2033,Great  Unstuffy Which Is Very Important To Me.,,,,,
,2037,I Called To Book As I Wanted To Be Sure My Chilldrens Room Was Interconnecting Or Adjacent. The Price Quoted Was Much More Than The Internet Price On Your Site So I Was Glad I Had Checked It First.  Had I Discovered The Difference Later  I Would Have Been Very Disappointed.,,,,,
,2038,We Stayed In A Cleave Tor Lodge For A Week And The Grounds And Facilities Were Excellent. Some Signage Or Guidance On How To Get Vehicles To Front Door To Unload Would Have Been Useful.  Thanks For A Great Stay,,,,,
,2040,Did Not Feel The Reception Staff To Be As Welcoming As They Might Have Been...,,,,,
,2043,Really Welcoming,,,,,
,2046,We Were There For A Special Occasion And We Were Made To Feel Very Special,,,,,
,2048,Very Welcoming,,,,,
,2056,Brilliant  Nothing More Needs To Be Said.,,,,,
,2058,All Was Excellent Thanks,,,,,
,2060,Extremely Smooth And Efficient. Enjoyed The Personal Tour Of The Building.,,,,,
,2063,Staff Remembered Our Dietary Factors Which Were Put Into Practice In An Attention To Detail Way Eg Soya Milk In Room For Tea Making. Full Marks.,,,,,
,2064,We Were Treated Like Royalty During Our Stay.,,,,,
,2069,Had E Mails Prior To My Arrival And Was Able To Book Spa Treatments And Cocktail Making Very Easily  Alex Looked After Us On Our Arrival And He Was Very Friendly And Professional.,,,,,
,2073,Dresses Were Taken To The Wrong Room - Twice! Think It Would Be Better If Tags With The Room Numbers Were Put On The Bags Rather Than The Porters Trying To Remember Them All!,,,,,
,2074,More Care Needs To Be Taken Over Guests Luggage,,,,,
,2075,All Very Efficient  Polite And Welcoming.,,,,,
,2084,From The Bags Being Taken From Our Car To The Young Man Giving Us A Tour  Our Stay Was Flawless. The Staff Were Inbelievably Helpful Without Being Intrusive  - Their 'Can Do' Attitude The Best I've Experienced.,,,,,
,2085,We Had To Keep Checking When Our Room Was Available Rather Than Being Informed. Also Offered A Coffee That Didnt Arrive Until We Were Asked Again.,,,,,
,2095,We Arrived In The Dark After A Long Drive And There Was Nowhere To Park And No Clear Signing In The Dark As To Where To Pull Up  So This Was The Only Poor Experience That Gave Us A Poor First Impression,,,,,
,2099,I Cannot Fault The Staff In Any Way  Very Professional And Friendly.,,,,,
,2101,A Fantastic Staff - From The Greetings 'In Tweed' To The Immaculate Reaction And Manner At The Front Desk.,,,,,
,2103,Everything Was Perfect!,,,,,
,2107,Very Impressed With The Staff Service Throughout Bovey A Can Do Approach And Made Everyone Welcome. Frederico Is A Star Works Extremely Hard To Ensure Everything Works Like Clockwork  He Is Bovey.,,,,,
,2108,No,,,,,
,2112,All Staff Were Extremely Helpful And Ensured Our Check In Was Quick And Easy.,,,,,
,2113,Staff Went Out Of Their Way To Be Helpful  And Yet Without Making It Appear Ostentatious That They Were Trying To Be Helpful... A Welcome Change From Other Establishments!,,,,,
,2114,Better By Far Than Expected!,,,,,
,2117,All Was Brillant,,,,,
,2118,Staff Were Extremely Helpful In Showing Us Around And Helping With Any Questions We Had. Going As Far As Lending Us Their Own Wellingtons As Our Size Were Already Being Used.,,,,,
,2122,Excellent Communication Via Email And Mobile Phone Offering Us Advice Of Making The Most Of Our Stay Without The Pressure To Do Anything Other Than Just Relax Which Is What We Wanted And Found At Bovey Castle 'Thank You',,,,,
,2123,The Welcome From Your Staff And Car Valet Was Very Impressive.,,,,,
,2125,All Very Smooth. Very Friendly Staff.,,,,,
,2127,Do Not Beleive You Could Have Done It Any Better,,,,,
,2130,Best Welcome We Have Ever Received When Arriving At A Hotel.,,,,,
,2133,We Ate At Bistro And They Were So Slow. We Pais For An Upgraded Room But Was Not As Good As Expected.,,,,,
,2134,I Cannot Rate Bovey Highly Enough.  Our Arrival At The Same Time As The Rest Of The Wedding Guests Was Handled So Well. The Staff We So Helpful With Getting Our Luggage From The Car To Various Rooms & Taking The Wedding Presents To The Bride & Groom's Room.,,,,,
,2135,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay At Bovey And The Golf And Beauty Therapy Treatments Made The Stay Even More Perfect! Thank You!,,,,,
,2136,The Welcome Front Of House Was Perfect. Reception Staff Friendliness Was Erratic  Some Very Friendly  Others Less So Particularly With The Handling Of The Room Not Being Ready When We Arrived. Arrival 12Pm  Room Not Ready To 2.30Pm. As Discussed With Federico  We Believe This Suee Could Be Managed Better By Asking Guests When They Book The Room Their Approx Eta. That Way A Guest Arriving At 7Pm Does Need The Room To Be Made Ready Quickly Compared To Guests Arriving Earlier  As An Example.,,,,,
,2137,I Appreciated Being Contact Beforehand By Bovey Castle To Confirm The Reservation And To Ask Whether I Needed Anything/Had Any Questions. That Was A V Nice Touch.,,,,,
,2139,No,,,,,
,2140,I Arrived Quite Stressed Due To Great Difficulty Finding The Hotel In The Dark. I Got Very Lost And Cannot Understand The Lack Of Signage To A Hotel That Is Going To Have Lots Of Non-Locals Travelling There.,,,,,
,2143,We Particularly Enjoyed Our Stay Last Weekend  However If We Had To Complain About Anything Then It  Would Be The Size And Variation Of Equipment In The Gym  Ie. Weight Bench Needed Heavier Weights. Apart From That The Pool Area Was Very Relaxing And Spacious  We Will Be Back Again. Many Thanks Nicola & James Davies,,,,,
,2144,No,,,,,
,2150,I Think A Link To The Map With The Pre-Arrival Letter Would Have Been A Good Idea And That The Suggested Activities Might Have Been More Targetted To A Family With 2 Children.  We Loved Our Stay At Bovey But My One Critism Would Be The Booking Which Included 2 Adults In The Edwardian Grill When I In Fact Booked The Bistro For 2 Nights Before Our Stay.  When I Came To Pay It Was Obvious To Me That As I Had Booked The Bistro I Should Not Have Been Paying For The Edwardian Grill!  I Think That Should Have Been Pointed Out To Me At The Time Of Booking.,,,,,
,2153,It Was Very Busy When We First Arrived And A Lot Going On In Reception Area But All Managed Well.,,,,,
,2158,We Arrived 630 Pm Friday 5Th In The Downpour. I Would Have Like To Hear A 'Welcome To Bovey Castle' From The Front Desk Or Some Kind Of Enthusiasm. 'Can I Help You' Was Pretty Much What I Received. No Offer Of Info Such As  'Breakfast Is Served From X To X  Your Room Rate Includes  The Breakfast Room Is Located X  The Gym And Pool Facilities Are Thus And Such' I Had To Ask These Questions To Get Information. I Then Asked About Seeing The Facilities. She Told Me The Young Man Who Was Handling Our  Baggage Would Be 'Glad To Show Us Around'  But I Then Demurred Due To The Hour  Wanting To Change For Dinner. I Had Mentioned In My Email That This Was A Special Return Trip For Our 30Th Anniversary & Hoped There Would Have Been A Note...Even Holiday Inn Chains Give One A 'Have You Stayed With Us Before' And Brief Introductory Remarks...Oh Well. The Young Bell Hop Was Very Accomodating And The Car Valet Service Was Perfect Throughout,,,,,
,2160,Parking Was Excellent,,,,,
,2161,As The Devonshire - Excellent,,,,,
,2162,I Will Forward My Travelzoo Survey To You,,,,,
,2165,Very Efficient And Pleasant,,,,,
,2166,It Was Fantastic.  Matthew Made Us Welcome And Was Highly Professional  Yet Cheerfully Welcoming.  He And Everyone Else Made Us Feel Very Special.  We Loved The Outfits.,,,,,
,2168,The Greeting By The Concierge And The Car Parking Was Much Appreciated. Very Polite And Helpful Young Man.,,,,,
,2172,Fantastic. I Loved The Fact We Were Called Prior To Arrival To Book Any Reservations.,,,,,
,2173,We Were Very Impressed With How Attentive The Staff Were!,,,,,
,2177,Very Imprerssed With The Car Valet Service,,,,,
,2183,It May Be My Age But I Found Booking The Sunday Lunch Package Difficult On The Website  Also Booking A Table.,,,,,
,2184,The Staff Are Excellent And Can Do Enough To Make Our Stay Very Memorable.,,,,,
,2185,The Welcome Was Amazing And Totally Stress Free,,,,,
,2186,Everything Had Been Efficiently Set In Place Via E-Mail Prior To Our Arrival,,,,,
,2187,It Was Nice To Be Waited On Right From The Start,,,,,
,2189,Excellent Again,,,,,
,2191,Wonderful Again  Will Be Back Next Week For Another Celebration Albeit An Anniversary Stay For My Mother And I As  She Is Now Widowed. Your Staff Were So Amazing When I Brought Her To Stay For Her Birthday And Again Last Week When My Husband And I Celebrated Our Anniversary I Could Not Resist Booking Again. Looking Forward To Next Tuesday Already. Thank You Once Again For A Most Enjoyable Stay And To Federico For All The Hard Work He Puts In To Make Everyone Feel Special.,,,,,
,2192,No.,,,,,
,2195,Very Efficient.  There Was A Call A Few Days Before To Confirm The Reservation Was Still Firm And Finalise Arrangements For Choice Of Restaurant.,,,,,
,2196,It Was Very Nice To Have A Telephone Call Just Prior To Our Stay To Confirm Details And Also To Be Able To Arrange Special Requests.,,,,,
,2197,No Everything Went Very Smoothly,,,,,
,2198,Pre-Arrival We Dealt With Rebecca In Events And She Was Fantastic. She Helped Point Me Towards Ideas For The Suprise Engagaemnt I Had Planned. She Was Easily Contactable At Any Time Which Made Things Go Very Smoothly. Also All Of The Staff Were Very Helpfull On Arrival With The Car And Helping To Find Us A Table For Afternoon Tea.,,,,,
,2202,We Had Never Stayed Here Before And Didn't Know What To Expect But Just Driving Into The Beautiful Grounds On A Frosty Sunny Afternoon Took Our Breath Away-Gorgeous!,,,,,
,2208,The Manager Fred The Italian Should Be Working For Travel Lodge As A Porter,,,,,
,2216,A Wonderful Experience  The Airport Transfer Was Very Comfortable  And The Upgrade Was Much Appreciated! I Cannot Wait To Come Again!,,,,,
,2218,It Was Good That Staff Contacted Me Prior To Our Stay To Confirm And Check Dinner Etc. I Was Also Impressed That They Called The Morning Of Our Stay - It Was The Day After The Awful M5 Crash - To Help Me With Any Travel Plans.,,,,,
,2219,Very Happy And Friendly Staff.,,,,,
,2223,Wet Weather. Wonderful To Be Met At Car With Umbrella!,,,,,
,2224,We Are Regulars At Bovey And Usually Stay In A Lodge. We Love The Activities Available But Would Like The Children's (Bovey Rangers) To Be Cheaper As Expensive If You Have 2 Children.  Frederico Is Always Wonderful And Charming. He Is A Real Asset To The Hotel.   I'm Happy Sat In Bistro Having A Coffee But Find It Lacks A Warmth And Ambience. Not Sure Why But Could Be General Layout. Lighter Colours Might Work. I Did Hear Quite A Few Complaints About Food/Timing And My Family Received Their Meals Really Late.  I Love The Lodge But Carpets Really Dirty On Arrival.,,,,,
,2228,Email Confirmation Was Prompt As Well.,,,,,
,2229,Tour Of The Hotel By Young Lady On Arrival Was Very Useful......Reception Staff Little Removed!,,,,,
,2231,Very Efficient Service. I Loved The Fact That I Had My Car Keys Taken And All My Bags Were Taken To The Room Without Any Fuss Or Me Having To Even Touch A Bag! Very Courteous Arrival.,,,,,
,2236,Pre Arrival A Male Rang Answering An Answer Phone Message I Had Left Re Trying To Book Afternoon Tea.  He Arranged For Afternoon Tea Earlier Than Normal.  This Suited Us Better Than The Normal Times. Very Helpful.  On Arrival Was Met By Reception Staff Who Were A Credit To You.  Very Helpful  Happy In Her Work And Made Checking In A Pleasure,,,,,
,2241,Very Professional  Prompt And Friendly,,,,,
,2242,No,,,,,
,2246,Excellent Front Of House Staff,,,,,
,2252,Very Friendly Welcoming And Organised,,,,,
,2253,No,,,,,
,2255,On Arrival I Was Told The Edwardian Restaurant Was Full Even Though I'd Booked A Long Time Ago. I Felt I Should Have Been Asked About Making A Restaurant Booking When I Made The Original Reservation. I'd Wrongly Assumed That As A Resident I Didn't Need To Make An Advance Booking. A Small Detail  But I Don't Understand The Need For The Porters To 'Arrange' The Cars In The Front Car Park  And For The Need To Keep An Area Clear. I Think It's A Bit Of Nonsense! I'd Rather Keep Hold Of My Car Keys Rather Than Have To Ask For My Keys Each Time I Go Out.,,,,,
,2259,We Arrived Early . Apparently 3Pm Check In . This Was Not Prominent  On My Booking Form . We Were Made To Fel A Bit Stupid . At 2:15 We Asked If Our Room Was Made Up . We Were  Told 3Pm . We Travel The World Extensively And Have Never Been Made To Feel As Awkward On An Early Arrival . ( Most Check Ins Are From 12 /1 Pm ) . Not Handled Very Well .,,,,,
,2260,Made Us Feel Extremely Welcome And Looked After Us 100%,,,,,
,2264,My Husband And Me Really Appreciated The Congratulations To Our Marriage And The Beautiful Room!!!,,,,,
,2267,Fantastic Stay And The Staff In Particular  The Bar Man And The Hotel Manager. Everyone Else Was Very Attentive But The Two Above Were Extremely Friendly And Went Out Of Their Way To Help Us.  Perfectly Located And All The Walks We Recommended To Do Via The Guided Walk Book Through Bovey Castle Were Great.   We Will Definitely Be Coming Back!,,,,,
,2270,Staff Were Amazingly Attentive And We Felt Immediately Welcomed And Relaxed.,,,,,
,2281,My Suitcase Was Sent To Another Room Despite Making Sure The Staff Member Had Clear Instructions And Labels Written Out Identifying Luggage.,,,,,
,2284,Very Good And Efficient.  People Called Me Back When They Said They Would And Were Knowledgeable About What We Could Do And The Hotel.,,,,,
,2285,Everything Was Immaculate  From Turning In At The Gatehouse And Driving Down To The Main House  To Being Greeted By The Staff At The Door. Loved The Staff 'Uniform'.,,,,,
,2287,The Service And The Food Quality Did Not Meet Our Expectations.  Room Service Breakfast On 2 Different Days Was Nearly Inedible.  Hotel Staff Were Not Friendly- With The Spa And Bar As An Exception.  We Selected Bovey Castle For A Special Occasion - But Felt Dissapointed By The Impersonal And Rude Staff At The Front Desk  The Bistro  And The Cathedral Room (For Tea Service).,,,,,
,2292,No,,,,,
,2296,I Appreciated The Email I Received A Couple Of Days Prior To My Stay As I Had Booked Months In Advance. I Was About To Call To Check That My Booking Was In Order  But Did Not Have To After Receiving The Email.,,,,,
,2301,I Had A Voucher With Travel Zoo. Even Though There Was Still Two Months Left To Run On The Voucher  The Hotel Made It Incredibly Difficult For Me To Book A Room. They Told Me That There Were No Dates Left And That The Deal Was Subject To Availability. I Had Already Paid For The Deal So I Was Annoyed By This! I Did Eventually Get Hold Of Someone Who Resolved The Issue But It Wasn't An Easy Experience!,,,,,
,2314,Craig Was An Excellent Guide And So Helpful.   The Lodges Were Perfect And Appreciated The Dog Bowls!,,,,,
,2316,When I Checked In I Wasn't Offered Help With My Luggage Or Shown Where The Lodge Was. I Had To Wander Round Looking For The Lodge By Name.,,,,,
,2317,Tell People Not To Use Sat Nav!!! Those Roads Are Scary In The Dark.,,,,,
,2320,Reception And Reservations Not Very Flexable And Stearn. I Didnt Understand Your Room Gradings And Wanted To Be Clear Of The Diffrent Levles As Not Having Photos Online Gallery,,,,,
,2323,Just Found The Arrival Process A Bit Of A Shambles.,,,,,
,2326,What A Warm Welcome We Got From The Wonderful Frederico!,,,,,
,2329,Unfortunately Our First Impression Was Affected By The Chaos Of The Lego Big Build Day  We Were Relieved When It Was Over. We Retreated To The Bistro For A Drink Whilst Our Room Was Being Prepared To Be Greeted By Hoovering At 2.30 In The Afternoon! Not A Good First Impression But We Were Glad We Gave It A Few Hours To Get Back To Normal.,,,,,
,2330,No Other Comments  Everything Was Communicated Clearly Both Before Our Arrival And On Arrival.,,,,,
,2331,We Were Very Happy To Be Given The Same Room As The Last Time  Which Was A Lovely One.  It Felt That It Had Been Done On Purpose.,,,,,
,2332,My Only Issue Regarding My Arrival Was That I Left A Message On The Castle's Answer Phone Requesting That I Be Met At The Exeter St. David Train Station.  When I Called Back During My Journey To Confirm Arrangements  I Learned That My Voicemail Had Not Been Acted Upon And That It Was Too Late To Have A Car Meet Us.  The Staff Did However Manage To Arrange To Have A Taxi Company Meet Us And Take Us To Bovey Castle  So In The End It Was All Fine.,,,,,
,2334,Would Have Been Better For Us To Be Shown To The Lodge Given The Change In Layout Since Our Last Visit,,,,,
,2336,It Was A Very Nice Touch To Have Someone Greeting Us Outside On Arrival,,,,,
,2340,None,,,,,
,2341,Overall We Had A Wonderful Stay At Bovey Castle.  If There Is One Point That Could Be Improved It Is That The Service Charge Policy Should Be More Clearly Explained At Check-In.  Our Party Had A Lot Of Confusion About Whether We Tip At Meals Or For Luggage  Etc.  Or Add More To The Service Charge When We Paid The Bill.  It Would Have Helped If The Desk Staff Gave Us More Information On The Service Charge Policy  Some Examples Of What Other Guests Do And A Better Sense Of What Staff Expects.  Also  We Did A Falconry Experience With Martin And Did Not Find Out Until Our Check-Out That He Is Not Part Of The Castle Staff And Therefore Wouldn't Share In The Service Charge.  We Left A Special Cash Gratuity In An Envelope For Him At The Desk Because The Falconry Experience Was One Of The Highlights Of Our Stay  And We Wanted To Make Sure That He Received A Gratuity.,,,,,
,2345,Everything Was Ready And Instructions For The Lodge Were Clear And Helpful,,,,,
,2346,We Hadnt Stayed At A Lodge Before.  We Were Uncertain About Offloading Luggage And Where You Could Drive Your Car To Get Near The Lodge.  There Is A Sign That States Cars Prohibited Buggies Only  Which We Adhered To But Realised After That It Was Acceptable To Park Near The Lodge To Offload Luggage.  It Would Have Been Helpful If This Had Been More Clearly Pointed Out.,,,,,
,2347,Very Quick And Easy Check In,,,,,
,2348,In Comparison To Our Last Stay Our Arrival / Check In Was Chaotic. Should We Have Been Offered A Drink? One Of Our Rooms Wasn't Ready. We Seemed Just To 'Drift In' Without Really Being Welcomed.,,,,,
,2351,All Very Good And Was Made To Feel Very Welcome,,,,,
,2353,Staff V Helpful,,,,,
,2357,Staff Were Incredibly Customer Focussed.,,,,,
,2358,Outstanding Staff,,,,,
,2362,Very Efficient & Courteous,,,,,
,2363,There Was A Problem With The Reservation  But It Was Dealt With Very Efficiently.,,,,,
,2364,Make It Clearer From The Start That A 'Tipping' Provision Is Included In Bill And Everyone Gets A Share  Makes It Slightly Awkward If Should Tip For Car Parking / Bag Drop Etc,,,,,
,2367,The Brasserie Was A Dissapointment  Gamon Was On  Fish Was Off  That Is Ok  But Then After Ordering Being Told That It Is Ham And Chips  Not Gamon  As Dissapointment Further  Then To Receive The Dish To Find Out It Is Not Carved Ham  Not From The Bone  But From A Packet  So For Â£14 Each My Wife And I Had Packet Ham And Chips With An Over Cocked Egg  This Was Our First Night  Our First Impression  What The Brasserie Lacked The Rest Of The Hotal Made Up For  But It Took The Shine Off My 28Th Wedding Aniversary  Plus I Have Already Told People  I Will Come Back  But A Sad Introduction  More Sad I Compained At The Time And Well.  Thank You,,,,,
,2369,We Were Shown To A Room With Only A Shower  And We Asked For A Room With A Bath Instead. Immediately This Was Dealt With Effectively And Allowed Our Stay To Be Enjoyable.,,,,,
,2370,Arrival Seemed A Bit Of An Anti Climax. We Were Approached With An Enquiry As To What Our Business Was At The Castle  And Then We Wandered To Reception To Be Told Our Room Wasn't Ready ( We Were Early So This Was Fair Enough.) Check In Used To Be Much More Of An Event  There Was A Warmer Welcome  A Welcome Drink And A Seat In The Lounge While Formalities Were Taken Care Of. I'd Prefer A Return To The Old Way!,,,,,
,2372,Very Friendly Tour Of Hotel,,,,,
,2377,I Had An Immensely Enjoyable Stay At The Castle Made Possible By All The Staff Who I Came Into Contact With.  I Was Nervous As My Two Young Boys Can Be Boisterous But The Hotel Staff And Environment Accommodated Them Without Any Problems And Made Us All Feel Very Welcome. Thank You So Much.,,,,,
,2389,Very Friendly Staff Rang Prior To Our Holiday To Ask If We Would Like Any Help.,,,,,
,2390,Front Car Park Had Many Bollards So Had To Park A Bit Further. These Removed By Morning,,,,,
,2392,The Staff Bent Over Backwards To Make Our Day Very Special (I Proposed To My Girlfriend In The Library). It Was A Perfect Visit.,,,,,
,2399,Despite Having A Toddler  We Weren't Asked If We'd Like The 'World Famous' Lego Concierge Service,,,,,
,2404,When I Phoned To Make The Booking The Staff Were So Very Helpful. On Arrival It Was Lovely To Have Valet Parking And Luggage Taken To Our Room. So Efficient And Welcoming.,,,,,
,2407,The Staff On Arrival Were Excellent.,,,,,
,2408,Customer Service Was The Best We Have Experienced  Even Though We Have Styed In 5* Hotels Around The World,,,,,
,2410,Quite Difficult To Work Out Which Lodge Was Ours And Howto Access It For Unloading - Maybe Names Front And Back  Or Staff Member To Accompnay Guests?,,,,,
,2419,We Arrived In A Rain Storm  Your Staff Could Not Have Been More Helpful.  Pre Arrival On A Wet Rainy Night We Only Spotted Two Signs To The Castle From The A38  It Is Nice To Have A Little Reassurance When The Weather Is Bad.,,,,,
,2422,I Understand From The Person Who Booked Our Stay That He Was Very Impressed With The Person Who He Spoke To With Regards To Requests/Arrangements.,,,,,
,2424,The Arrival Was Disappointing As We Were Not Met At The Train Station As Expected When We Arrived Even Though We Had Rented A Car And Organized A Driver For Our Three Day Stay  We Had To Call The Castle And Wait For A Driver For An Hour,,,,,
,2430,Everyone Including Pre Arrival Contact Very Efficient,,,,,
,2432,We Had Been Allocated A Late Dining Time  (We Always Eat Early) As The Bistro Was Very Busy. However  We Were Slotted In  We Were The First In And Not Many Diners Ate Afterwards So That Was A Bit Of A Puzzle.,,,,,
,2437,It Was A Very Pleasant Drive Through The Grounds And Upon Arrival We Were Met Before We Had Both Feet Out Of The Car - And From Then On Your Staff Absolutely Shined,,,,,
,2449,It's A Bit Of A Bore To Have The Car Parked Well Away Form Main Entrance  Though I Do Understand Why You Do It; A Forgotten Bit Of Luggage On Arrival Entails A Long Walk In The Rain. If I Come In My Bentley (Instead Of My Mercedes Estate As This Time ) Next Time  Will It Be Left At The Front Door?!!,,,,,
,2450,Advance Calls And Pre Arrival More Than Helpful,,,,,
,2451,Arrived At 1:00Pm But Room Not Ready Until 2:50. I Know The Stipulation Is 3:00 But I Do Think It Could Have Been Readied Earlier As We Were Waiting.,,,,,
,2454,Reservations People Were Very Helpful In Providing Important Information On Train Connection From Heathrow Airport To Bovey Castle  And Also Arranged Pickup At Train Station At Exeter. Driver Was Waiting For Us When We Arrived At Exeter. Very Helpful And Most Appreciated.,,,,,
,2462,Federico Was Excellent  Discussing My Needs And Gave Reassurances That The Stay Would Be Memorable.,,,,,
,2467,Difficult To Get Confirmation Back From Reservations,,,,,
,2468,When I Booked This Year I Asked For The Same Room As Last Year And For Some Reason Was First Of All Shown To A Room Overlooking The Car Park  Where As Last Year Had Been Overlooking The Grounds.  Apparently The Room We Had Last Year Was Not Available. We Did Have An Upgrade Last Year Because The First Room I Was Shown Was Not Suitable  Which May Have Caused The Confusion But Eventually  This Year  We Were Shown Room 14 With Which We Were Perfectly Happy.  I Will In Future Keep A Note Of The Room Number As Your Classifications Do Not Spring Easily To Memory.  We Will Be Back Next Year In Late June And Look Forward To Our Return.,,,,,
,2469,Very Pleased With Arrival Staff,,,,,
,2471,I Was Surprised At Reception. We Thought It Was Messy And Some Evening Staff Were Not So Friendly. I Had Ordered A Birthday Cake And Champagne To Be In Our Room For My Husbands 50 Birthday. Neither Were There. When I Asked They Were Brought Up But By Then The Surprise Had Gone.,,,,,
,2472,It Was A Wonderful Experience,,,,,
,2475,Pre-Arrival Contact Was Fantastic. The Girls In The Events Team Were Extremely Helpful And Everything Was Taken Care Of. Adam Did Very Well To Get The Serious Amount Of Luggage We Had In The Lodge  Even In The Rain!,,,,,
,2480,Weren't Told Breakfast Times And Where It Was Held. Wasn't Told That The Pool Was Closed Or About Anything To Do With The Hotel.,,,,,
,2484,Very Hard To Find  Sat Nav Took Me Miles Away.,,,,,
,2487,As With Every Arrival/Departure Experiece The Concierge And Reception Are Under Intence Pressure  The Staff Remained Friendly And Professional Throughout And The Process Was As Good As I Have Received Anywhere Previously. I Did However Feel That The Area Behind The Reception Desk Was Cluttered And Untidy. A Minor Point Really.,,,,,
,2489,All Pre-Arrival Contact Was Handled Efficiently And In A Friendly And Helpful Manner.,,,,,
,2491,Amazing Staff  Amazing Location  Amazing Food!! Our Dream Wedding Became True!,,,,,
,2497,Made To Feel Special From The Minute We Walked In The Front Door.,,,,,
,2500,They Should Check Title As My Documents Were All 'Ms' When I Am Dr But Had Not Been Asked,,,,,
,2501,Error On Booking Addressed Us By Another Customers Name  Unprofessional And Advised Resort Team Worked Till 9 But Not There After 7. Called On 3 Occasions With No Success. Also Warned No Denim Even Though Website Says Smart Causal.,,,,,
,2502,I Have Been To Bovey Castle Previously And Was Treated Fantastically  However This Time Was A Completely Different Experience. On Arrival I Explained That I Was On A Spa Day And Was Shown To The Morning Coffee Room  Where I Was Left For Over An Hour  Despite Informing Staff That I Was Ready To Go Down To The Spa. The Previous Time Spa Staff Collected Us Within About 20 Minutes Or So  However This Time The Receptionist Took Us Down. No Robes Or Slippers Were Given To Us  I Had To Ask Where They Were. I Also Left My Mobile Phone At The Hotel And After Numerous Phone Calls  No Member Of Staff Seemed Keen To Get Back To Me. Totally Disappointed And I Will Be Writing A Letter Of Complaint.,,,,,
,2503,When We Arrived We Told Reception We Were Here For A Spa Break  She Told Us To Go To The Spa Area. When We Got There  There Was No One Around. After 10 Mins We Headed Back To The Front Reception And Questioned The Receptionist And She Didn't Seem To Know What The Protocol Should Be. She Called Someone And An Events Manager Finally Arrived With Robes And Slippers And Guided Us Around The Facilities.,,,,,
,2505,Arrival Staff Were Great,,,,,
,2506,No Valet On Arrival Or Directions To Parking.,,,,,
,2511,An Email Or Phone Call Prompt Would Have Nice A Day Before Arrival.,,,,,
,2512,Had To Wait Longer Than Expected For The Room. Compensated With Tea!,,,,,
,2514,Your Staff Were Well Informed About My Stay And Activities Booked On Arrival And Made A Really Positive Impression.,,,,,
,2515,Staff Made Us Feel Very Comfortable.  I Had A Message On The Phone The Day Before Regarding Any Activities I May Want Booked - A Really Nice Touch.,,,,,
,2516,The Staff Were Especially Lovely With Our 10 Month Old Son And Made Him Very Welcome Despite The Fact That He Was A Bit Cross After A Long Drive. Thank You So Much!,,,,,
,2518,The Porters Were Excellent Throughout Our Stay. Reception Checked Us In Fine But Didn't Explain Anything About The Hotel (E.G. Where Breakfast Is Served  Facilities  Etc) And On Another Occassion Spent Time Chatting (For Some Time) To Another Staff Member Before Dealing With 3 Customers Queuing.,,,,,
,2519,I Had Booked A Pick-Up From Exeter St. David's Station Several Weeks Before Our Arrival. I Then Phoned To Confirm This On The Actual Day And To My Surprise Was Told That There Was Nothing On The System. I Therefore Had To Wait For Federico  The Manager To Phone Me To Arrange For This To Be Done So This Was The Only Let Down.  Craig Came To Pick Us Up And He Was Great. He Was Very Friendly And Helpful And Gave Us A Tour Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,2521,Excellent Service From Staff Throughout,,,,,
,2524,It Makes Such A Difference To Know That The Staff Will Collect You And Drop You At The Station And That You Have Helpful And Friendly Staff / Drivers To Hand.  Ashlie And Polly Were Fantastic To Deal With Prior To Arrival And So Helpful With All The Updates We Made To Our Agenda For The Meeting.,,,,,
,2526,It Would Have Been Good To Receive Pre-Information On The Cider And Sloe Gin Making Course - It Was Full By The Time We Arrived On Saturday At 2Pm - Given That Check-In Is At 3Pm  This Must Be A Common Problem!,,,,,
,2527,It Would Have Been Good To Be Told About Activities Before Arrival.  We Arrived On The Saturday And Really Wanted To Go To The Cider And Sloe Gin Making Activity But It Was Already Fully Booked By The Time We Arrived And Were Informed Of The Activity.,,,,,
,2532,Check-In Was Effortless And A Joy As A Result,,,,,
,2535,From The Very Start Of Our Stay At Bovey Castle My Partner And I Were Welcomed In Style. Every Member Of Staff Treated Us With V.I.P Service And The Hotel Was An Amazing Place To Stay. The Short Period Of Time That We Did Stay Went By Too Quick. Will Hopefully Be Returning In The Future To Relive Our Fablous Time.,,,,,
,2536,We Weren't Given A Hotel Tour That I Observed Other Guests Receiving.  We Were Shown To Our Room By A Man In Boots And Outside Coat...Which Just Seems A Bit Odd!  Our Request For A Twin Room  Although Resolved  Was Dealt With In A Heavy Handed Way.  Instead Of Discreetly Being Sorted A Bit Of Fuss Was Made.  I Think Mainly To Do With The Fact We Were Dealing With Someone Who Didn't Typically Show People To Their Rooms.,,,,,
,2540,Would Have Preferred An Earlier Check In Time Than 3Pm.,,,,,
,2543,The Staff Were Amazing! Friendly  Nice  Accommodating! They Really Went Out Of Their Way To Ensure That We Had A Wonderful Time. Though We Were Only There For 24 Hours And Had Never Been Before  We Were Truly Impressed With The Level Of Service And Dedication Of The Staff Towards Us,,,,,
,2544,Perhaps A Sign Or Pre Information Advising You Have People Ready To Park Your Car At The Entrance. You Might Already Have Some That I'd Missed.,,,,,
,2547,Staff Were Very Welcoming As Per Usual And My Daughter Was Delighted At Being Presented With The First Of Many (Chocolate) Gold Coins!,,,,,
,2549,Attention To Detail In Getting Our Bags To Our Rooms Was Poor As Our Room Was Not Ready On Arrival Prior To The Wedding Nor Were Our Bags In Our Room When We Were Given The Keys. We Had To Ask Again For Our Bags And Even Then Some Items Were Left In The Car Which We Had To Ask For The Following Morning.,,,,,
,2557,None All Very Professional,,,,,
,2558,The Atmosphere Of The Public Rooms Downstairs Is Lovely  Very Homely And Gentle With Plenty Of Sitting Areas  Well Arranged And Very Comfortable  The Real Fires Are Very Special.,,,,,
,2559,Whenever I Telephoned Before Arrival I Had To Hang On The Phone For An Inordinate Amount Of Time As There Nver Seemed To Be Enough Receptionists. This Could Have Been In The Daytime Or At Night. If I Had Not Already Booked I Think I Wouold Have Given Up And Gone To Another Hotel.,,,,,
,2560,All Staff Welcoming Apart From From Front Of House.,,,,,
,2569,No,,,,,
,2575,No,,,,,
,2579,Very Efficient Arrival - Car Taken  Luggage Taken And Although Room Not Ready (We Were Early) We Were Taken Round By Ben Who Was Very Friendly And Knowledgable,,,,,
,2581,Unfortunately On Arrival  My Wife's Handbag Was Sent To The Wrong Room And It Was Not Until The Following Morning  That It Was Discovered In The Room Of One Of Our Group.,,,,,
,2583,A Little Disconcerting To Have The Car Whisked Away And So Many Staff 'Hovering' But Helpful Nontheless,,,,,
,2591,Arrived Before Checkin Time  Staff Was Helpful About Storing Our Bags While We Played Golf.,,,,,
,2592,Everything Went According To Plan Very Impressed Thank You,,,,,
,2593,Everything Was Excellent  Thank You So Much.,,,,,
,2594,The Outdoor Staff Were Excellent. Charming Welcoming And Efficient.,,,,,
,2595,Not Sure I Would Want To Drive There Because Of The Entrance.,,,,,
,2609,Nn,,,,,
,2621,No,,,,,
,2623,No,,,,,
,2632,Unfortunately  There Was A Wedding At The Same Time And It Was Raining Very Hard. Furthermore  There Was An Audi-Pres.  And Thus We Were Not Really Welcome  I Felt. But The Staff That Was Around Us In The Lodge Was Very Friendly Then.,,,,,
,2634,Very Good Stay !,,,,,
,2635,Signage On Adjacent Roads Poor- Had Some Difficulty Finding You,,,,,
,2636,Staff Efficient But Probably Trying A Bit Too Hard To Be 'Friendly'. Something Artificial About It As If They Were Competitors In The Apprentice'.,,,,,
,2638,All Very Efficient,,,,,
,2640,No,,,,,
,2642,We Were Ushered Into A Lounge To Sign In Away From Reception.,,,,,
,2644,Excellent All Round Service,,,,,
,2647,Staff Were Welcoming Friendly And Polite.,,,,,
,2651,We Were Taken To Room 9 And Despite Been Informed By Reception That We Would Be Shown The Room The Member Of Your Results Team Simply Disappeared. Room 9 Was Awful. We Were Offered Room 55 Which We Had To Find Ourselves And It Was Like An Oven. We Could Not Leave The Window Open Because Of The Kitchen Smells From The Bistro. The Service Refreshment Time Was Dreadful As Others Pointed Out. On Arrival I Asked The Car Park Attendant About Wi Fi And The Rapid Answer Was Yes But You Have To Pay! We Also Thought For The Cost Of The Dinner It Was Surprising That Chefs Little Complimentary Dishes Were Absent. But When You Read The Details Of The Facilities It Is Obvious The 'Complimentary' Is Not Part Of Bovey Castle Thinking. After All You Can't Add 12.5% To Something That Is Expected In The Price.   Very Disappointing Visit  Pm Grasby,,,,,
,2653,You Contacted Us By Phone A Day Or Two Before Our Visit Which Enababled Us To Pre Book Afternoon Tea And Dinner.  This Was Helpful,,,,,
,2656,Everything Excellent,,,,,
,2659,Very Disappointing Service And Response From Your Reservations Team. They Didn't Return Phone Calls  Nor Reply To E-Mails. When You Were Fortunate Enough To Speak With Someone And Ask A Question  They Said That They Would Check-Up And Reply  But No Such Reply Was Received (This Happened More Than Once).,,,,,
,2663,Pre Arrival Talking To Donna/ Felicity Re Booking Extremely Helpful   Professional But At The Same Time I Felt They Were Treating Me And My Requirements With A Kind And Thoughtful Manner. On Arrival Greeted By The Gentlemen In Their  Plus Fours And Tweeds Were Very Helpful With Our Luggage And Showing Us Our Lodge.,,,,,
,2667,When I Responded To The Details On The Wedding Invitation The Price Quoted Was Not Available Until I Telephoned And Asked Why The Booking Was Then Made At The Published Price.  I Was Told I Had Been 'Upgraded' When I Checked In But No Details Were Given As To Why Or From What!,,,,,
,2672,We Found The Staff Exceptionally Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,2676,Normally A Hotel Like Bovey Castle Would Be Way Out Of Our League - But Your Staff Made Us Very Welcome And Put Us At Ease Both Over The Telephone When We Made Our Reservation And From The Minute We Arrived.,,,,,
,2678,Than You For The Great Experiance,,,,,
,2681,All Staff Very Polite And Welcoming   Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,2682,Everything Was Perfect As We New It Would Be Thankyou,,,,,
,2688,Despite Several Email Exchanges That Were Very Delayed In Responses From The Local Er Concierge Contact  We Were Not Informed That The Day Of Our Arrival  The Castle Would Be Entirely Off Limits To Us For A Private Wedding.  This Should Have Been Communicated To Us In Advance So We Could Have Been Prepared Mentally.  We Were 'Shooed' Away Even The Next Morning And Told That The Castle Was Re-Opoened At Noon  Not 'The Next Day' As It Was Explained On Our Arrival.  The Front Desk Staff Was Disheveled And Unorganized At Times.  We Received No Welcome From The Er/Portico Concierge  And Never Met Her/Him Despite Numerous Emails In Advance.  This Was The Most Disappointing Element Of Our Time At Bovey.,,,,,
,2689,Polly & Federico Showed Us Around With Great Warmth & Enthusiasm. A Lovely Welcome.,,,,,
,2692,We Were Early For Our Room  The Room Was Not Available Until 3 Pm Exactly. Our Guided Tour Was Fine But At 1:40 We Were Asked If We Would Like Tea In The Room Next To The Library. The Guide Said They Would Organise It. At 2:30 After 2 Chase Up's We Got Our Tea. Not A Good Start .,,,,,
,2696,We Had A Great Time And Appreciated The Quality Of The Environment  Its Cleanliness And Presentation (Including Our Room And Bathroom)  And The Helpful Staff. We Also Valued The Way That Familes And Adults Without Children Can All Enjoy Their Time Without Impinging On One Another. We Very Much Appreciated Our Upgrade - Thank You.  We Did Find The Bar Staff Overstretched In The Evening.  We Were Disappointed That The Way Tea Is Organised Means No One Can Sit In The Lovely Lounge Areas For The Whole Time Even Though Tables Were Actually Only Occupied For A Limited Spell While Tea Was Being Taken.  We Expected To Find A Selection Of Magazines In The Lounge Areas (Country Life? Devon Life?). ,,,,,
,2697,Had To Call A Couple Of Times To Get Booked  Room Was Not Ready Upon Arrival,,,,,
,2698,When We Arrived We Were Taken On A Tour Around The Castle Which Was Very Helpful. The Little Owl On Reception Also Made Us Feel Welcome!,,,,,
,2703,Arrival Was Good. We Were Not Informed That We Needed To Book Our Evening Meal  And Therefore Could Not Eat Until 8.45. Also It Was Not Made Clear That Breakfast Was Not Included In Price  But A £100 Was Taken For Evening Meal !! Also I Would Not Have Paid The Price You Charged For The Breakfast Which Was Ok At Best. Also As I Had Talked Through The Type Of Room I Wanted I Was Disappointed With The Room We Were Given.,,,,,
,2708,Very Impressed With Everything Looking Forward To Come Again,,,,,
,2710,Superb Service,,,,,
,2718,Although We Had Gone To Some Trouble To Identify Special Dietary Needs For Our Grandson For The Weekend They Seemed To Get Lost In The System And Nobody Knew Anything About Them,,,,,
,2728,Just To Say How Extremely Helpful Everyone Was,,,,,
,2729,Porters Made For Lack Of Effeciency By Reception Staff,,,,,
,2734,3Pm Check In Too Late Especially When You Are Expected To Check Out At 11Am The Next Day,,,,,
,2738,Our Original Booking Was Unavailable And The Alternative Was Unacceptable Initially. The Manager  Freddy  Kindly More Than Compensated With The Offer Of A Suite. We Are Grateful For The Gesture.,,,,,
,2744,The Car Park Was Busy When We Arrived We Parked At The Back And Carried Our Bags In.,,,,,
,2745,No,,,,,
,2751,Frederico Was Exceptional.,,,,,
,2752,The Resort Staff Were Very Good In The Days Leading Up To Our Stay And Organising Our Spa Treatments And Dinner Bookings. I Had Discussed The Fact This Was A Special Treat For Our Wedding Anniversary And Was A Little Disappointed We Weren't Upgraded....,,,,,
,2753,Staff Couldnt Help Enough.Excellent,,,,,
,2755,Whilst The Reception Staff Were Lovely And We Were Offered A Room Upgrade For A Small Extra Charge  When We Were Told That The Room Would Be Ready As Soon As Possible We Did Not Anticipate That This Would Be 1.5 Hours! We Had A Drink In The Bar But Were Then At A Loss What To Do As Our Books Were In Our Suitcase Which Had Been Taken To The Room And It Seemed A Big Problem When We Asked If We Could Get Them. We Were Staying For One Night Only  Our Anniversary And A Night Away From Our 5 Year Old Daughter So Time Was Precious To Us.,,,,,
,2762,It Would Have Been Helpful For Someone To Show Us Round The Hotel. Our Room Wasn't Ready So We Were Told To Wait  But We Weren't Shown Where To Go Or Where The Spa Facilities Were  Or That A Code Was Needed To Get In To The Changing Rooms.,,,,,
,2766,Very Easy  Had Managed Internet Shop Delivery For Us,,,,,
,2772,I Was Impressed With How The Staff Was Able To Change And Transform The Various With Out Caking Attention To Themselves. Just Quietly  Efficiently Did Their Job.,,,,,
,2774,Under Very Difficult Conditions With Everybody Arriving At The Same Time The Staff Did An Excellent Job Organising People And Rooms And At All Times Were Courteous And Helpful,,,,,
,2775,Very Dated Reception Shabby Only One Key That Didn't Fit Well,,,,,
,2777,On Arrival My Car Keys Were Asked For And Later That Day I Noticed That My Car Had Been Moved And Another Car Put In The Same Place  I Did Not Like This Operation At All And Would Have Expected My Car To Have Only To Be Moved In Case Of An Emergencey.,,,,,
,2779,A Little Intimidating  With So Many Staff Hovering  Offering Help,,,,,
,2783,Fantastically Brilliant!,,,,,
,2785,We Were Attending A Wedding Which Was Being Held At 3Pm. When We Arrived We Were Told Our Room And Even  The Brides Room Would Not Be Ready Until 3Pm. We Had Arrived At 11:20Am After A 280 Mile Drive.  We Were Given Our Rooms At 12:45 But This Was Only After Both The Bride And Groom Had To Continue To Push For It. Unnecessary Stress But Luckily Was Sorted Quickly.,,,,,
,2792,The View From Our Room Was Of The Front Entrance And To See The Manor In Which My Vehicle Was Parked Left A Little To Be Desired!!,,,,,
,2794,Excellent Over All Experience Pitched Just Right,,,,,
,2795,On Arrival Our Room Was Not Available.  The Individual At Checkin Said 'Now That We Know Your Here We Will Let Housekeeping Know And They Will Be Fast Should Be An Hour.'  I Had Booked Car Service Directly Through The Hotel So They Should Have Known Very Well When I Would Be Arriving As You Were Picking Me Up :}.  It Took Several Hours Before Room Was Ready And I Had To Ask 3 Times  Each Time I Was Told It Will Be 10 Minutes I Will Come Get You  Each Time I Waited Around 30 Minutes Before Going And Asking Again Myself.  On The Third Try They Said Oh Yes It Is Ready But Had Never Come To Tell Us...  Atmosphere Was A Mix  There Are Some Amazingly Wonderful Staff Here Most Of All Federico!  Unfortunately Around The Restaurants It Seems Staff Are Not As Engaged Nor Friendly.  Every Meal We Had In The Restaurants Up To Our Very Last One Involved A Lot Of Sitting Around Waiting For Staff To Come By And Difficulty With Any Requests Which Contrasts Hugely With Our Experience Elsewhere In The Hotel.  ,,,,,
,2796,No,,,,,
,2799,Several Calls Were Made Prior To Our Arrival With Minor Queries Which Were Always Dealt With By Knowledgeable Staff  In An Efficient And Courteous Manner.,,,,,
,2802,The Hotel Was Very Well Staffed  But They Seemed Clueless As To How To Faciliate Things Such As Car Valeting Etc..,,,,,
,2805,We Had A Wonderful Time  But Our Room (10) Had An Awkward Layout  With The Chairs And Table Stuffed In Front Of A Smaller Window Than Most Valley Rooms  And Jamming In The Desk So That We Couldn't Pull Out The Chair To Sit In It. The Wall Paper In The Bathroom Was Torn Near The Mirror And Had Water Marks At The Bottom To The Right Of The Sink  As Well As Other Marks. Generally The Decor Of The Room Was A Little Tired. Finally  While He Tried Very Hard  When Asked  Our Maitre D Told Us That Shin Was A Type Of Bread  So We Were Quote Surprised To Bite Into A Meat Dumpling... Again  Generally We Had Quite A Wonderful Time.,,,,,
,2807,Made Very Welcome By All Staff,,,,,
,2808,Prefer To Park My Own Car,,,,,
,2809,Extremely Warm Welcome And All Anxious To Please,,,,,
,2810,I Was A Little Dissapointed  With A Few Things Tables Not Cleared Quick Enough  From Previous High Tea Customers  Not All Staff In The Usual Smart Uniform  Ashtry Outside Overflowing Glasses On Table Outside From Night Before.  Onlylittle Things But Bovey Has Always Been Outstanding When We Have Stayed Before. This Is No A Critisisum But Pointing Out Things,,,,,
,2813,Very Efficient Without Being Pushy,,,,,
,2817,The Staff Were Very Attentive And Friendly,,,,,
,2819,My Husband Had A Folding Scooter Which Could Be Used Indoor And The Help And Service  From Your Staff Could Not Have Been Better,,,,,
,2821,Date Error Made  But Promptly Rectified By Phone Call.,,,,,
,2823,Pre Booking Tables Was A Nice Idea.,,,,,
,2825,Friendly And Professional. Staff Extremely Well Presented. Approachable.,,,,,
,2827,The Staff Were Very Friendly And Unpretentious .. Which Is Very Much What I Prefer,,,,,
,2830,My Dealings With Leanne To Make The Booking Were Friendly And Professional.,,,,,
,2831,I Think It Would Have Been Useful For Our Pre-Arrival Letter To Include A Link To The Map For The Location Of The Hotel And That The Activities Suggested Might Have Been A Little More Targetted To A Family With 2 Children.,,,,,
,2832,On Arrival  We Were Asked If We Wished To Upgrade Which We Did.,,,,,
,2841,When We Went To Go There Was A Little Confusion As Nobody Made It Clear That The Car Was Brought Up. Even The Driver Didn't Know But As He Was Leaving In A Few Days Time I Guess He Was De-Mob Happy!,,,,,
,2843,I Was Contacted Pre Arrival And A Kind Message Was Left On My 'Phone.  Unfortunately  When I Arrived At 1.40 P.M. The Room Wasn't Ready And The 3.00 P.M. Check In Time Was Being Upheld!!  However  I Did Have A Very Pleasant Lunch In The Bistro,,,,,
,2845,No 'We Look Forward To Welcoming You And Hope You Enjoy Your Stay. These Are The Parking Arrangements.....' E.Mail Prior To Visit - Premier Inn Do This - It's Very Pleasant And You Know Exactly What To Do When You Arrive.   We Weren't At All Sure Where We Could Leave The Car When We Arrived At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,2847,Could Have Been A Warmer Experience,,,,,
,2848,Quite Difficult To Find Which House Was Ours - Not Clear Where To Go To Unload - Maybe Names At Front Or Back  Or Staff Member To Acccompany Guests?,,,,,
,2855,The Arrival Was Friendly  But Not What I Call Warm,,,,,
,2858,I Think The Arrival And Greet Procedure Should Be Looked Into  What A Guest Wants  Should Be The Priority Not The Rules And Regulations. Particular Attention Should Be Paid With The  Storage Of Car Keys  We Were Not The Only Guests To Have Their Keys Lost. The Staff Are Very Polite But Should Decline From Personal Conversations In Front Of Guests. The Food Was Mediocre For A Five Star Hotel  Quite Pleasent In The Bistro (But Not Five Star) The Crockery Laid Out For Breakfast Was Stained With Tea (Cups) And Some Of The Food Open To The Elements Looked Dried Up. We Enjoyed The Views And Grounds Our Room Was Clean  The Shower Room Was Rather Narrow  The Television Signal In The Evening Was Diabolical (Unable To Watch).,,,,,
,2861,On My Previous Visit The Arrival And Welcome Were Superior With Someone Showing Me To My Room And Offering Me Sloe Gin.,,,,,
,2865,I Have Requested A Bottle Of Champgne To Be In The Room Prior My Arrival And This Was Not Done . I Had To Request Twice.,,,,,
,2866,None,,,,,
,2868,The Staff In The Spa Were Very Helpful And Efficient In Helping To Arrange Our Treatments.,,,,,
,2871,Lorran Gave Us A Very Warm Welcome And After Showing Us To Our Room Gave A Helpful Tour Of The Ground Floor Rooms And Facilities,,,,,
,2876,My Problem Is That I Do Not Like Surrendering My Car Keys. Better Car Parking Facilities Would Appeal To Me.,,,,,
,2880,Very Discreet Contact With The All The Front Desk Staff Whilst Planning To Propose To My Girlfriend.  We Both Enjoyed The Tour Of The Facilities And The Castle.,,,,,
,2882,Cost Was Damaged On Departure  However It Was Dealt With Well And Complimentary Dinner And Breakfast Given On Our Next Visit 4 Weeks Later.,,,,,
,2885,Very Warm Greeting,,,,,
,2891,Considering We Had Many Calls About Our Visit The Reception Staff Handled Us Brilliantly,,,,,
,2895,When I  Made The Booking On The Telphone The Person I Spoke To Was Very Friendly And Helpful,,,,,
,2898,Staff Were Incredible Throughout,,,,,
,2905,All Staff Were Curtoius And Efficient,,,,,
,2907,The Staff On Reception Were Very Good Indeed.,,,,,
,2909,We Were Made Very Welcome And Given A Tour Around The Castle Which Was Helpful. There Was A Little Owl At Reception Helping To Sign Guests In Which Was Unique And Unexpected. The Castle Is Stunning.,,,,,
,2912,We Thought Your Staff Very Welcoming And Made Us Feel Expected Wanted Guests,,,,,
,2913,Verywelcoming Made Us Feel Expected And At Home,,,,,
,2929,Room 58 And The Ensuite Were Spacious But We Felt Not To Site Up To 5 Star Rating. Wardrobe Rail Was So High Up That Uncomfortable Tip-Toe Stance Was Needed To Get Hangers Up. Sink Slow To Drain  Tv Very Temperamental But We Were Warned About This On Arrival  And It Did Not Work Very Well. Furniture Slightly Utilitarian,,,,,
,2933,Very Welcoming!,,,,,
,2934,We Were A Little Confused About Where We Could Stop In Front Of The Hotel As Large Area Coned Off. This Resulted In My Parking Some Distance Away Near Some Golf Buggies. Once In The Hotel Reception Sataff Were Very Quick And Friendly.,,,,,
,2946,I Tried To Use My Travel Zoo Voucher. Even Though The Voucher Was Still Valid For Two Months  I Had Great Difficulty In Arranging A Date With The Hotel. However  This Was Eventually Sorted Out - After Quite A Bit Of Debate With The Hotel.,,,,,
,2955,No.,,,,,
,2957,Had A Brilliant Time  Xx,,,,,
,2971,Booked The Weekend As A Present For My Partner Birthday.  The Welcome Was Very Nice  But The Upgraded Room We Had Room 56 Looked Very Tired.  Their Was Stains On The Wall  The Bathroom Curtain Stained.  And The Main Window Was Broken  Pics Have Been Taken.  Not What We Would Call 5 Star At All.,,,,,
,2977,I Had Booked A Junior Suite And The Person In Charge Of Our Tour Assured I Would Have One And Was Showed A Junior Suite With A Valley View For Me When He Came To Check Out The Rooms  Like I Had Previously When I Had Stayed There.  However  When I Arrived  The Room I Was Given Was Not A Valley Room And Was Quite Noisy Because It Was Very Near The Door And Parking In Front.  I Will Not Go Into Further Details But Because Of That  Unless I Was Traveling With Others Who Insist On Going To Bovey  I Would Not  Nor Will I Recommend The Hotel.  Nevertheless  I Would Say That Most Of The Staff Were Very Nice  And The New Chef Is A Huge Improvement.,,,,,
,2980,Car Oak Too Far Away,,,,,
,2981,In January  Midweek  We Felt Rather Alone  And Missed The Falconry Display  As It Was Cancelled Without Prior Warning. Also We Were Interrupted By A Head Waiter  Mid Conversation During Our Only Dinner At Bovey Castle  As He Felt Obliged To Add To Our Private Conversation  Which Was Unwelcome. From Thereon  Wwe Dined Elsewhere.,,,,,
,2985,I Emailed You Direct Having Booked Via Secret Escapes  With My Room Requirements  On 26/10/12.  I Did Not Receive A Reply.  I Did Receive A Telephone Call A Few Days Before Our Stay To Ask For Spa Treatment Requirements And Dinner Reservation Times  And Contact Staff Seemed Unaware Of My Earlier Email,,,,,
,2994,The Setting And Meet And Greet On Arrival Is Wonderful. The Breakfast And Restaurant Experience Was Very Poor. Even Every Day Basic Requirements Were Not Met. It Is Such A Shame As The Expectation And Grandeur Of Your Hotel Is Badly Let Down By Service.,,,,,
,3010,Made To Feel At Home Right From The Start,,,,,
,3012,It Was Not Clear To Us On Booking Our Summer Madness Package That A Service Charge Would Be Added To The Accommodation And Meal Costs.,,,,,
,3018,Hotel Beautiful But Let Down Unfortunately By Poor Staffing,,,,,
,3025,We Were Offered An Upgrade Which We Decided To Take  The New Room Took Longer Than The Stated Time To Prepare  If We Had Known The Actual Time We Could Have Gone For A Walk Around Which Would Have Been A Better Use Of Time.,,,,,
,3032,Initially We Were Not Allocated A Room On The Side Of The Hotel We Had Selected With Leanne  However When This Matter Was Referred To Frederico The Problem Was Quickly Rectified And We Were Very Pleased With Room 04,,,,,
,3047,Arrival - Complimentary Tea/Coffee Biscuit. Just A Suggestion - We Purchased This On The Day But Have Stayed In Other Quality Hotels Where This Was Provided As Part Of The Welcome/Orientation Experience.,,,,,
,3048,Staff And Service Inconsistent. Disappointed. Should Have Run Like Clockwork But Clearly Had Serious Issues.,,,,,
,3050,We Can Only Emphasise The Friendliness And Helpfulness Of All Staff; Frederico Was   Unquestionably  The Most Visible And Friendly Hotel Manager I Have Come Across,,,,,
,3051,N/A,,,,,
,3052,Made To Feel Very Welcome,,,,,
,3057,Professional Not Efficient,,,,,
,3061,All Rather Tired This Time Round  And The Staff Whilst Pleasant Enough Lacked Experience Making Things A Little Clumsy And Awkward,,,,,
,3063,All The Arrangements And The Staff Welcome Were First Class...Felt At Home Right Away,,,,,
,3065,We Were Staying In Rose Cottage And We Found The Standard Of Preparation  Excellent. It Was So Lovely And Welcoming To Arrive To The Fire Burning!!,,,,,
,3078,Was Not Happy To Have My Credit Card Details Wrttern Down On A Bit Of Paper,,,,,
,3088,I Was Disgusted To Have My Credit Card Stolen From My Wallet Which I Had Left In My Room - Wrongly Assuming It Was Safer Than To Have It One Me!,,,,,
,3094,Fantastic Frederick Made Us Very Welcome We Had A Great Time And Will Definitely Come Again Thank You!!,,,,,
,3095,A Great Welcome   Feels Like Arriving To A Friends Home,,,,,
,3098,Pre Arrival Expeerience Not Great.,,,,,
,3102,Arrived At 2.30 Pm And Was Advised Our Lodge Was Not Ready! Suggestted We Passed Through To The Sitting Room And Waited There  Were Not Shown To The Sitting Room And Had To Come Out And Find Someone To Order Refeshments  After 45Mins We Returned To Recption As Knowone Approaced Us To Advise That We Could Move Into Our Lodge  Seems Recption Feel They Should Not Step Over The Desk!,,,,,
,3123,No,,,,,
,3131,Our Room Was Very Cold . The Radiator Did Not Work .,,,,,
,3704,It Was A Brilliant Experience!,,,,,
,3705,The Place Is Amazing!,,,,,
,3707,We Were Very Impressed By The Level Of Service We Received During Our Stay.  Resort Manager  Craig  Was Most Helpful Throughout Our Entire Stay And Could Not Have Done More For Us.  The Catering Staff  Specially In The Bar Were Also Very Attentive  Small Touches Such As Remembering Our Preferences Etc Made A Real Difference.  Please Extend Our Thanks To Them.,,,,,
,3709,As Always You Made My Kids (Tired From The Journey) Immediately Welcome.,,,,,
,3714,Some Of The Receptionists Were Not Friendly,,,,,
,3715,Great Help From All - Setting Up Events For The Week Was Easy Too,,,,,
,3716,We Arrived Early So We're Told We Could Go To The Grill And Have A Drink While The Room Was Being Prepared. We Found The Grill But Could Not Get Any Service. Having Been Ignored By The French Barman We Managed To Ask Another Scruffy Waiter Where We Should Sit And How We Should Order  So On His Instruction We Sat Outside And Waited... For Noone To Come Out Again. It Took Another Trip Inside To Get A Round Of Drinks. At The End Of The First Round A Waiter Happened To Ask If We Would Like Another - So We Said Yes - After Waiting Another 10Mins For Round Two We Gave Up. We Said To The Lovely Lady Manager On The Way Out That We Couldnt Get Another Round So She Offered Us Comps Next Time - Which Was Great. But What A Poor Start To Our Stay.,,,,,
,3724,Prearrival Call Was Nice. Arrival No Warm Welcome When Asked If We Could Be Helped  We Stated We Were Here To Check In  Girl Near Door Sounded Shockedand Replied Oh Youre Checking In As If We Were Not Good Enough To Stay There. This Massively Dampened My Partners Feeling About The Stay. This Trip Was Specifically For A Relaxing Break For My Partner As He Was Suffering From Stress And I Wanted Him To Have A Nice Break. The Girl Behind Reception Was Pleasant But The First Encounter We Had Set The Tone For The Break. Retraining Maybe An Idea?,,,,,
,3725,Excellent Staff - Very Welcoming.,,,,,
,3726,Difficult To Find Out The Activities Which The Hotel Offers (One Of The Main Reasons We Had Visited).,,,,,
,3729,No,,,,,
,3739,Everything Was Perfect,,,,,
,3740,Everything Was Perfect. The Only Minor Thing Was That When Creating My Booking I Asked If I Could Have A Bottle Of Champagne In The Room On Arrival. I Didn't Get The Champagne Or A Reply To This Request.,,,,,
,3743,Staff Were Friendly On Arrival But Nobody Showed Us Around The Hotel Which Would Have Been Useful As Our Room Wasn't Ready And We Didn't Know Where To Go. Also Nobody Explained That We Needed A Code To Access The Changing Rooms Or Explained What Time Dinner Or Breakfast Was.,,,,,
,3751,No Our Stay Was Fantastic,,,,,
,3752,Could Have Been Given Time Options For Booking Dinner Reservation,,,,,
,3753,Very Kind And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble  It Was A Fantastic Stay The The Gentlemen That Helped Us With Our Bags Where Extremely Polite.,,,,,
,3762,Na,,,,,
,3769,Perhaps A Free Of Charge Arrival Drink Whilst Being Shown The Hotel Would Be A Nice Touch - Especially For Those Who Have Driven A Long Way.,,,,,
,3770,Very Expensive Dining And Drinks. Felt Food In Edwardian Grill Not Up To Par For Price.,,,,,
,3776,Generally  The Welcome Staff Were Excellent.  I Was Surprised When We Arrived However That The Otherwise Beautiful Forecourt Of The Castle Was Crammed Full Of Cars  With Temporary Cones To Delineate Parking. Clearly This Was A Busy Sunday But It Does Seem That Ruining The Entrance To The Castle By Making It Into A Car Park Is Perhaps Not The Best Way To Introduce Guests To Their Hotel.,,,,,
,3788,My Wife And I Absolutely Loved Our Stay  We Both Even Preferred Your Hotel And The Atmosphere Created By The Staff To The Experience At Chewton Glenn. Outstanding Hotel.,,,,,
,3792,The Staff At Bovey Are Fabulous  At Every Moment We Felt Special And The Service We Received With The Doors Being Opened  Bags Taken To Room Etc Was The Icing On The Cake.,,,,,
,3794,No,,,,,
,3803,Although I Know That The Hotel Was Fully Booked It Didnt Seem That Way As The Staff We Freely Available And  They Made Us Feel Welcome.,,,,,
,3805,Extremely Helpful Prearrival Email Assistance.,,,,,
,3808,Everyone I Had Contact With During My Stay At Bovey Displayed Complete Professionalism & A Warm & Friendly Manner. Although They Were Dealing With A Large Amount Of Guests Checking In At Once Everything Ran Smoothly!!  Thank You For A Wonderful Stay..,,,,,
,3810,Arrival Was Quite Frustrating  As The Information By The Staff Was Ambiguous; As We Arrived Before 3Pm  We Were Informed That The Room Was Guaranteed By 3Pm However Probably Be Available Before. We Then Asked Every 20Min Or So For 2 Hours  To Have The Room Exactly At 3Pm And Not A Minute Earlier. And 5 Minutes After Entering The Room Somebody Came In To Fix The Lights. Other Than That The Experience Was Good  Especially The Dinner Experience And Staff Who Supported Moving Us From The Bistro To The Restaurant.,,,,,
,3811,As We Booked Last Minute  I Called The Hotel To Check There Was Space  And They Put Me Through To The Reservations Team. I Left A Voicemail And No One Got Back To Me  So I Ended Up Booking Online  Though I Felt Put Out That No One Bothered To Return My Call. There Is No Denying You Guys Have Sussed The Arrival Process. We Felt Very Welcomed To Bovey Castle  And Enjoyed Our Tour Around The Venue And Facilities.,,,,,
,3815,The Younger Staff In The Bistro And Serving Afternoon Tea Were Very Poor. I Think That They Just Need The Same Direction As The Staff In The Restaurant,,,,,
,3821,The Level Of Service And The Friendliness Of The Staff Was Fantastic,,,,,
,3822,Very Easy To Organise - Thank You Federico And Polly,,,,,
,3823,We Liked The Owl (Who We Were Lucky Enough To Meet The Next Morning) On Reception.,,,,,
,3829,Brilliant Stay. The Staff Couldn't Have Been More Helpful Or Friendly.,,,,,
,3831,On Arrival There Could Have Been More Information Made Available To Guests About What To Do In The Area Eg. Better Walking Information. Staff Were Reasonably Helpful When We Asked  But Information Was Not Offered On Checking In.,,,,,
,3842,Really Excellent - I Felt Really Welcome And Very Spoilt!,,,,,
,3852,None - Very Good Service,,,,,
,3855,Pre Arrival Communication Via With With Catherine And Donna Was Great,,,,,
,3856,Staff Checking Us In And Showing Us Around Couldn't Have Been More Welcoming Or Lovely - Really Lovely Start To Our Stay,,,,,
,3859,Very Friendly And Professional,,,,,
,3862,Staff Was Unsure About How Washer Dryer Worked In Lodge And We Were Looking Forward To Using It Right Away,,,,,
,3863,I Found Pre Booking Two Adjoining Doubles And One Single Room And Their Location Quite Difficult.  I Booked Early Only To Be Told That Their Were Very Few Available And That The Single Was A 'Very Good Size'.  It Was The Size Of A Shoe Box And We Would Have Picked A Larger Room.,,,,,
,3865,Excellent Stay Once Again,,,,,
,3871,Everyone Was Excellent  We Got Caught In The Snow On The Way And Couldn't Reach The Castle  Headed Back To Moretonhampstead And Were Collected By Your Staff. The 2 Guys That Helped Us (One Is The Cocktail Man  The Other Don't Know What He Did But He Took Us To The Castle In His Car) Were Really Good. Also Got A Courtesy Call From The Spa Saying Conditions Were Bad  And Seeing If We Still Intended Going.,,,,,
,3873,Julia Gave Us A Lovely Tour  Luggage In Room When We Got To Our Room.,,,,,
,3877,The Porter Had No Idea What I Was Asking When I Asked For Valet Parking.  I Arrived Early With My Mother In Law And Children And Had Many Bags  To Have These Collected And Any Help With This Was Delayed And Inefficient.  Front Desk Staff However Were Very Friendly And Courteous At All Times.,,,,,
,3884,Lovely Place. Very Accommodating Staff That Couldn't Do Enough For You. Also Loved The Pool Area  And The Food Was Excellent.,,,,,
,3885,The Resort Staff Were Brilliant In Particular Polly  Who Sorted Lots Of Things Out For Me Pre-Arrival And During The Stay.  Also Heather (And The Reception Staff) Did A Great Job Of  Sorting The Baby Listening Equipment Out.... And They Were Very Patient!!,,,,,
,3888,Spa Was Booked Out In Full Which Was Disappointing And Welcoming Staff Member Was Vague On Some Points. Did Not Like Being Told What Time We Would Be Dining,,,,,
,3889,On Arrival  As Much As It Is A Pain To Have To Hear About All Of The Facilities And Where They Are A Small Abridged Version Might Have Been Helpful Rather Than Us Having To Find Everything On Our Own.,,,,,
,3892,Your Website Does Not Allow You To Book In Dogs  Which Means You Cannot Get A Full Quote For The Stay,,,,,
,3895,Reception Staff Were Friendly.   They Did Offer To Upgrade Us For £40 Per Night But When We Looked A That The Upgrade Room There Wasn't A Great Deal Of Difference (Apart From Larger Bathroom).   Also Given The Hotel Was Virtually Empty I Would Have Thought To Enhance Our Visit They Could Have Upgraded Us Foc.  Certainly When We Have Stayed In Similar Hotels They Have Done That Foc When The Hotel Was So Empty,,,,,
,3898,Loved Being Met At My Car  And Also The Little Tour Of The Hotel Was Most Welcome,,,,,
,3899,The Original Booking Procedure Was Painful!,,,,,
,3901,We Were Warmly Welcomed And Enjoyed Lunch And A Relaxing Time In The Lounge Until Our Room Was Ready.  However Although We Were Told That We Would Be Informed When Our Room Was Ready This Seemed To Be Forgotten And We Had To Ask.,,,,,
,3903,Booking Spa Treatments Was Quick And Easy Too  With A Response To My Email Made Within The Hour On A Sunday Evening  Thank You.,,,,,
,3907,The 'Magic' Seemed To Be Missing. There Seems To Be A Lot Of New Staff Who Have Not Inherited The Quality Of Their Predecessors. Before  Nothing Seemed Too Much Trouble Whereas This Time It Seemed More Functional Service.,,,,,
,3915,The Car That Collected Us From The Station Was Not Clean - 10 Minutes Giving The Internal Windows A Clean Would Have Made A Big Difference,,,,,
,3917,Per Arrival - Booked On Bovey Website Based On Email From Bovey With 40% Discount On Rooms. Booked 1 Night Stay For Saturday Night. After Booking This Was Able To Take A Days Annual Leave From Work So Enquired About Booking A Second Night By Emailing Bovey Directly. Was Told They Were Unable To Honour The Discounted Rate And Was Offered The Best Available Rate On A Room Only Basis. This Annoyed Me So Decided To Stay Somewhere Else En Route On The Friday Night. Having Been On Your Website With The 'Best Rate Guaranteed' I Didn't Bother To Look On Other Websites For Discounts. When I Mentioned This To A Friend- She Said That She Has Seen An Offer On Secret Escapes Website For Dinner Bed And Breakfast For Less Than The Room Only Rate Offered Directly By The Hotel. Cheeky - And Did Not Impress Me. So  I Booked Via The Secret Escapes Website For The Friday Night. You Really Need To Take The 'Best Rate Guaranteed' Statement Off Your Website As It Is Completely Misleading.,,,,,
,3918,The Staff Were Extremely Helpful On The Phone Before Our Arrival And Very Welcoming.,,,,,
,3920,We Were Of The Understanding That The Room Rates Included Breakfast And Were Very Surprised To See It Charged. Previously We Had It Included  And Considering The Costs Of The Room And What We Spent That This Wasn't Very Good,,,,,
,3924,Pre-Arrival Contact: I Tried Twice To Book A Spa Treatment Up To 4 Weeks In Advance And Couldnt.  I Completed The Contact Us Form And Nobody Called Me Back.  Then I Called The Hotel  Got Put Through To The Resort Desk  No Answer  Left A Vmail And Nobody Called Me Back. Very Poor Service In That Respect.,,,,,
,3926,There Had Been Two Rooms Booked In My Name When Only One Was Requested.,,,,,
,3927,Our Welcome Was Warm And Efficient.,,,,,
,3930,Have Sent Email With Feedback.,,,,,
,3932,Arrival: Our Party Was 4 People However We Arrived At 2 Separate Times. The First Party Was Booked To Have Lunch In The Bistro. When The Second Party Arrived They Were Shown To The Lodge But Then Not Shown Where The Bistro Was To Locate Us. The Poor Phone Reception Meant That We Were Unaware That Our Friends Had Arrived And Also Meant That They Too Did Not Know Where We Were Located.   Pre Arrival: We Were Not Made Aware That There Was A Wedding At The Hotel Which Meant That We Could Not Use The Majority Of The Facilities On The Arrival Day. By The Time We Were Told  It Was Too Late To Find Anther Date To Suit All Parties. Also  The Booking For The Wine Tasting Was Moved From Saturday To Sunday Without Us Being Told - We Only Found Out 2 Weeks Before Our Arrival And Only By Us Checking An Itinerary Confirming Our Reservations And Bookings For Our Weekend Did We See That I Had Been Moved. In Addition  This Wine Tasting Was Then Cancelled The Day Prior To Our Arrival.,,,,,
,3937,We Where Promised To Be Shown Around The Hotel But Staff Promptly Forgot. Saw Other Guests Recieve Correct Treatment,,,,,
,3945,Disappointed That The Staff Was Not Aware That We Came Before And Offered To Show Us Around It Would Be Nice To Hear A Welcome Back Rather Than Giving Us The Feeling We Were Never There Before,,,,,
,3949,I Was Asked For My Key Half Way Through My Stay So My Car Could Be Moved  Not Sure Why This Wasn't Requested At Check In.,,,,,
,3952,Excellent As Always,,,,,
,3953,1)Pre Arrival Rooms Were All Requested In The Main House And Yet This Wasn't The Case Once We Arrived. 2)I Had To Locate My Email To Prove Our Booking And What Was Included.  3)It Was More Than Obvious That There Were Serious Staffing Issues And Service In The Restaurant Was Not Only Slow But Poor.  4)The Decor In The Bedrooms Needs Updating As The Curtains Certainly In The 3 Rooms I Went In Were Mouldy And Stained.  5)The Coloured Towels In The Pool Area (Female Changing) Were Bleach Stained. Perhaps Just Stick With White As Then It Cant Be Noticed.  6)On Saying All Of This The Staff (Frederico Olivia And Verity)  Were Excellent And Tried Under Such Hard Circumstances To Make Our Stay As Good As Possible.   Overall It Was Not The Experience My Husband Or I  Especially With All The Planning For His 40Th Birthday Expected And In Truth We Felt Extremely Let Down.  Regards Mrs E Oakley,,,,,
,3955,As Booked Over The Telephone We Were Recommended A Package Deal Informing Us That We Were Intitalled To An Amout We Could Spend On Food During Our Stay Regarding Our Evening Meal  On Arrival No Information Was Given To Us Or No Email Conformation Was Received So Was A Little Blind Into What Was Available To Us Getting The Best Value For Money During Our Stay,,,,,
,3956,We Had Not Recieved Any Information On Our Package Deal Regarding Dinner Amounts So Wasnt Familiar With The Offer We Had Paid For,,,,,
,3957,Love The Tweed Staff Uniforms- Distinctive And Smart,,,,,
,3958,We Booked A Break Over Easter On A Special 3 For 2 Deal And I Called Up To Make The Reservation. We Wanted A Family Room With A Separate Room For The 2 Chiildren (Aged 1 And 3) And Gave Their Names And Ages With The Booking But Arrived To Find Ourselves In A Single Smallish Room (Room 25) With A Cot And Sofa In The Room. (Clearly It Looked As Though We Had Been Bumped Into Another Room And Was The 3 Year Old Expected To Sleep On The Sofa?) I Asked For A Bigger Room And Was Given A Choice Of Moving To Room 60 Which We Accepted (At Least It Was A Big Bigger) When Leaving A Charge Of An Extra £200 Per Night Was Added To The Bill Which I Was Not Happy About. I Agreed To Pay £400 (2 Of The 3 Nights As We Had Already Booked Under A 3 For 2 Deal) I Would Have Been Happier Getting A Separate Room For The Children (Which Is All We Wanted) And Disappointed To Pay The Extra Money. We Always Enjoy Staying At Bovey Castle But This Experience Was Not The Best.,,,,,
,3959,All Very Good  As Usual,,,,,
,3965,Very Helpful Staff With Our Luggage,,,,,
,3966,All Very Good.,,,,,
,3967,My Parents Were Promised A Room Upgrade By Room 47 Wasn't Ready Any Better Than Our Standard Room 32,,,,,
,3972,I Tried To Book A Single Room Over The Phone And Was Told There Were None Available But Went Online And Was Able To Book One. On Arrival I Found I'd Been Given A Room For Disabled Guests Which Wasn't A Problem But It Would Have Been Courteous To Have Cleared This With Me Beforehand,,,,,
,3973,3Pm Is Too Late For A Check In Time Especially When You Have To Check Out At 11Am The Next Day,,,,,
,3976,We Were Unaware Of Where To Park Our Vehicle  No One Greeted Us  There Was No One At The Door And No One Carried Our Bags In. This Was Not Our Experience Of When We Previously Stayed  As Last Time We Were Overwhelmed By The Welcome And Could Not Fault Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,3980,No  Staff Are Always Friendly And Approachable As Well As Efficient And Professional. Couldnt Fault Any Of Them,,,,,
,3982,All Your Staff Were Friendly  Professional  Polite And Unpretentious. Very Impressed.,,,,,
,3983,The Staff Were All Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,3984,Every Member Of Staff I Spoke To Prior To Our Arrival Was Poliite And Very Helpful,,,,,
,3990,We Stayed In A Lodge And The Logistics Of Getting A 4X4 Outside Of The Lodge Entrance Was Not Really Explained To Us.  Would Be Better If This Is Explained Before Arrival Or If Buggies Could Unload/Load On Arrival/Departure.,,,,,
,3994,None.,,,,,
,3995,Only That We Weren't Told About The Lego Room Service Or Anything About The Children's Activities At Check In Which I Thought Was A Little Odd,,,,,
,3996,Staff Were Absolutely Fabulous  Even Better Than In The Big Hotels In Asia!,,,,,
,3997,A Little Busy When We Arrived As A Wedding Was Arriving  May Have Been Good To Say What Time They Were Due To Arrive As Made It A Bit Fraught,,,,,
,4000,Initially Made Contact By Phone Two Months Before The Stay  Then An Email Informing The Hotel I Was 17 Weeks Pregnant And Unable To Eat Gluten.  I Confirmed This Again On Arrival When Making A Dinner Reservation But This Information Did Not Assist With Any Alternative Menu Choices  No Gluten Free Biscuits In The Room  No Gluten Free Rolls At Dinner (Commercial Sliced Bread) And No Pastries Or Alternatives At Breakfast.  Also  The Maitre D' Did Not Check That My Dessert Was Gluten Free And The Chef Had Sent This Out With Shortcake Concealed Within The Ice-Cream.,,,,,
,4001,Whilst The Staff Were Very Friendly And We Were Offered A Room Upgrade For A Small Extra Charge We Did Not Anticipate That When We Were Told The Room Would Be Made Up Asap That This Would Be 1.5 Hours!! Our Books Were In Our Suitcase And It Seemed To Be A Big Problem For Them To Be Retrieved From The Case In The Room And So After A Drink In The Bar We Were Twiddling Our Thumbs For At Least Half This Time. We Were Staying For 1 Night Only For Our Anniversary And A Night Away From Our 5 Year Old Daughter So Time Was Precious To Us.,,,,,
,4003,I Loved The Welcome By The Guy Who Parked My Car And Had My Case Taken To My Room Whilst I Was In A Meeting With The Events Team. Nothing Seemed Too Much Trouble For The Staff.,,,,,
,4008,The Personal Greeting Card From Federico And Teh Champagne In Our Room Were An Excellent Thought - Thank You.,,,,,
,4011,Fabulous As Always,,,,,
,4024,The Owl On The Reception Desk Was Quiet Something!,,,,,
,4031,Not Clear Where To Park And Parked Quite A Walk Away Which Was A Challenge With The Bags Coming Back Up The Hill,,,,,
,4042,Within Our Line Of Work  Michelle And I Stay In A Number Of Hotels Throughout The Uk And Abroad. We Can Honestly Say That The Staff Excelled In Everything They Did And Didn't Do  Which Is Equally Important  To Make Our Experience Truly Exceptional. We Can't Wait To Return.  Thank You  Easy Avenues Limited,,,,,
,4044,Leanne And Polly Were Both Extremely Helpful In Making Arrangements For Our Group  Thanks Again.,,,,,
,4045,We Did Overshoot The Turnoff And Went Straight Through To Bovey Tracey And Had To Backtrack.  Better Signage Could Help.,,,,,
,4046,No Information Given To Maximise Site And Facilities - Very Disappointing.,,,,,
,4048,Excellent Communication Both Via Email And Telephone Regarding Further Details Of My Booking With You.,,,,,
,4050,Not Happy Regarding No Vehicle Access To Lodges As Previously. Didn't Want Staff Unpacking Our Car But Had No Choice.,,,,,
,4057,Fabulous!  I Particularly Loved That The Staff Also Engaged With Our Little Boy And Made Him Feel Very Welcome Too :),,,,,
,4069,Very Good Concierge,,,,,
,4071,Very Helpful And Quick Response To Emails.,,,,,
,4072,Special Thanks To Craig For Organising Activities For Us,,,,,
,4090,The Arrival Was Ok But Not Very Forward Helping With Info,,,,,
,4093,We Had To Change Our Reservation By One Day And Everyone Was Very Helpful And Accommodating.,,,,,
,4095,Reservation Handled By Danny Was Excellent. Arrival - Another Member Of The Party Had Already Checked In  So Limited Contact With Reception / Arrival Procedure. Disappointed That More Information / Details Re Facilities  Dining  Lego Menu Were Not Offered.,,,,,
,4102,It Was Better On First Visit - Sloe Gin Offered And Actually Shown To Room By Friendly Staff,,,,,
,4103,Breakfast In The Room Was A Shambles Jake The Accountant Was Made Aware,,,,,
,4109,I Called On The 14Th Oct 2012 To Book A Surprise Honeymoon For My Wife And I As Our Wedding Was Taking Place On 15Th Oct 2012 At St Audries Park. I Spoke With Catherine And Explained That Our Visit Would Be Our Honeymoon And Explained That My Wife And I Would Be Looking For Spa Treatments In Order To Help Us Relax After Our Wedding Day. Cathrine Advised That I Would Be Better Booking The Mid-Week Madness Offer And Adding Spa Treatments On Our Arrival. As Requested I Booked A 2 Night Stay On Line And Telephoned Cathrine Again After Booking To Confirm That All Was In Order And Reiterated Again That The Visit Was For Our Honeymoon. On Arrival There Was No Concierge To Greet Us And After Parking The Car We Walked Into Reception. As We Approached Reception I Was Asked By A Staff Member If We Were There For Afternoon Tea And I Explained That I Was Looking To Check In. Perhaps It Would Have Been More Polite To Say 'Good Afternoon Sir  How Can I Help You?',,,,,
,4113,We Were Jumped On The Second We Got Out Of Our Car - I Think This Is A Bit Too Much. We Had Just Been Away For A Week And Needed To Get Our Car Organised.....Without 2 Men Hanging Around Watching. Then We Were Told To Wait For Our Room And Someone Would Get Us When Our Room Was Ready. We Had A Drink And After An Hour And A Half Noone Had Come To Told Us That Our Room Was Ready. As An 8-Month Pregnant Woman I Was Very Keen To Get To Our Room - But It Seemed As Though We Were Just Forgotten About.,,,,,
,4114,There Was Some Confusion About Our Room Being Ready And We Were Waiting For About Twenty Minutes Until I Returned To Reception,,,,,
,4115,All Staff Were Excellent! Initial Impressions Of Bovey Castle Were Very Favourable And Valet Staff Were Warm And Friendly.,,,,,
,4120,It Would Be Nice To Have Been Greeted Before We Entered The Building.,,,,,
,4121,All Very Good Service.,,,,,
,4129,Very Difficult To Find The Castle Coming From The South. Lack Of Clear Road Signage,,,,,
,4131,Fantastic Welcome Both For Us And For Our Dogs! Excelent!,,,,,
,4133,Many People On Reception  But Had To Wait A While For Someone To Give Us Our Key And To Show Us To Our Room. Bit Disorganised.,,,,,
,4139,All Very Good,,,,,
,4140,Only As Before - Reception Were Not Flexible Initially Regarding The Room. Other Than That I Always Find The Staff At Bovey Castle Really Helpful.,,,,,
,4144,All Excellent,,,,,
,4153,We Enjoyed The Service And The Quality Of The Accommodations. The Extra Activities Was A Very Nice And Unexpected Touch. We Attended The Falconer Demo.,,,,,
,4155,No,,,,,
,4158,On Arrival The Chap Who Showed Us Around Did Not Seem Interested At All. Showed Us To Our Lodge But Did Not Help Us With Luggage,,,,,
,4159,Arrival And Greeting Was Very Warm And Welcoming,,,,,
,4162,Appreciated The Pre-Arrival Phone Call And Reservations Made For Dinner.  When We Arrived  We Were Greeted And Assisted Immediately In A Really Lovely And Welcoming Manner And We Fell In Love With Bovey Castle Straightaway.,,,,,
,4164,Just Great - Exactly What I Needed After A Horrible Journey!,,,,,
,4166,Amazing Experience,,,,,
,4168,Loved The Dress Code Of The Staff And All Were Pleasant And Helpful And Made The Arrival Welcoming,,,,,
,4169,Superb; Staff Were Incredibly Professional And Friendly,,,,,
,4172,I Would Definitely Return Had We Not Expeirenced Such Choas Surrounding Each Meal.  Staff Were Either Too Few Or Untrained  And Food Was 3 Star But At 5 Star Prices.  Everything Else Exceeded Expectation  And For Those Reasons We Would Love To Return With Our Extended Family For A Group Holiday Together. However  3 Meals A Day At The Hotel  With The Current Issue At Hand  Would Not Be Acceptable.  For That Reason  We Would Only Consider A Lodge So That We Could Cater For Ourselves.,,,,,
,4175,We Stayed Two Nights In Bovey Castle With 3 Families With Children Between 10 And 13 Years Old. We All Had A Great Time. We Had A Personal Treatment We Will Never Forget: We Could Use One Of The Living Rooms For The Afternoon Tea  Apero And Diner Only For Our Company. That Was Top!!!! It Is Only A Pitty That Both Restaurants Do Not Have The Atmosphere Of The Hotel. The Interior Is Too Modern. But The Food Is Great. The Bathrooms Are Not The Expected Level. Atmosphere Is Too Cheap.,,,,,
,4176,I Had Arranged Spa Treatments For 2:45Pm And Had Requested A Check In At 2:30 So That We Could Quickly Get Changed To Go To The Spa. But Our Rooms Were Not Ready So It Was A Bit Of A Let Down On Arrival,,,,,
,4179,The Valet Parking Is Generally Good Though  Car Returning Process Should Also Be Handled By The Hotel Staff. I Was Forced To Find My Car On Foot For More Than 5 Minutes When It Was Rainy  Because No Hotel Staff Could Not Remember Where My Car Was Parked.,,,,,
,4184,A Pocket Of Tranquility That Makes You Feel Like You've Had A Long Rest Even After 1 Nights Stay  Thoroughly Recommend,,,,,
,4185,I Was Informed That Smart Dress Is Required While Attending The Evening Resturant  We Did Not Expect To See Customers Wearing Dirty Jeans & Lumber Jack Shirts!,,,,,
,4192,The Waiting Staff In The Bistro Were Very Bad.  No One Smiled  Service Was Slow A Real Let Down From Our Previous Years At Bovey.    Reception Staff And Maintenance All Very Good.  I Was Concerned That The Ferretts And That Area Looked Neglected.  The Ferretts Didn't Have Any Water When We Went To See Them. The Letterboxing Wasnt Available  A Lot Of The Tubs Were Missing Or Wet And Mouldy  Which Was Disappointing To The Children.  Overall I Could Tell That The Hotel Was Up For Sale And A Lot Of Things Were Not As They Have Been In The Past.,,,,,
,4194,I Have Previously Stayed In The Lodges And Ordered Food From Tesco Which You Have Kindly Taken Delivery Of And Unpacked For Me.  I Did The Same This Stay And Was Charge £15 Which Was Unexpected And I Would Not Have Used The Service If I Had Known.  In Addition  Usually You Unpack The Shopping And This Time You Charged Me And Didn't Even Unpack It!,,,,,
,4198,A Little Slow In Getting Back To Me Re- Reservation And Activities  But Nothing Outrageous,,,,,
,4202,We Were Made To Feel Very Special Even Though We Had Booked The Break On A Special Deal  Thank You,,,,,
,4204,I Understand The Admin Around The Booking Wasnt The Greatest But Once I Arrived Everything Was Perrfect,,,,,
,4205,The Meet And Greet Was Very Good And The Grandeur Of Your Hotel Is Splendid,,,,,
,4210,A True 5* Experience,,,,,
,4211,None - Everything Was Exceptional,,,,,
,4216,Our Room Was Not Ready As There Was A Late Departure  Although We Were Happy In The Bar For A While  It Was Longer Than Expected.,,,,,
,4218,Did Not Get Called This Time. Previous Year Received A Call About Arrival Time  Dog Basket Requirements Etc.,,,,,
,4224,Everyone Was Very Helpful And Welcoming. We Felt At Immediately At Ease With Them.,,,,,
,4228,We Liked Being Personnally Shown Around The Facilities.,,,,,
,4229,The Young Ladies On Reception Were Very Pleasant As Was The Finance Manager .  The Reservations Lady Said She Would Honour The Offer Of Champagne In The Room On Arrival As I Confirmed The Booking On 1St July But I Did Not Receive The Champagne.,,,,,
,4236,On Booking My Room  I Informed A Member Of Your Staff That We Would Be Arriving On My Son's Birthday  20Th February And That It Would Be Nice To Do Something Special For Him. I Was Specifically Told That Something Would Be. I Also Requested A Complimentary Upgrade  As This Was My Third Visit And My Children's First   I Wanted The Hotel To Impress The Children. I Was Told That  That Would Be No Problem At All. Upon Arrival  I Was Told That There Would Be No Upgrade Due To It Being A Busy Time. I Accepted That And Stated That It Was My Son's Birthday. This Was Met With No Remark And Let's Get On With Business. I Have Ticked 'Neither Agree Nor Disagree' Because I Felt That The Whole Welcome Process Was Of A False Nature And Not Genuine. One More Thing  It Stated On You Website That You Were Continuing The Lego Concierge And That An Order Form Would Be Handed To The Children Upon Arrival. This Did Not Happen And I Had To Come Down From My Room To Collect Said Forms. Overall  I Am Very Underwhelmed.   ,,,,,
,4238,Our Room Wasn't Quite Ready  But We Were Encouraged To Use The Spa. We Went Down To The Pool  But Had To Return To Reception As We Were Confused About Lockers  Robes And Towels.,,,,,
,4242,Fabulous!!!  Food Great!!!  Managers Handsome!!!,,,,,
,4243,Donna On Reservations Was Very Helpful And All The Staff Made You Feel Welcome,,,,,
,4244,All Very Efficient,,,,,
,4251,When Trying To Find Out About And Book Activities I Got Conflicting Info,,,,,
,4252,From Booking To Checking Out  It Was Very Efficient And Easy.,,,,,
,4256,Having Seen That There Were Three Junior State Rooms Suitable For Family Use  We Had Specifically Asked When Booking Over The Telephone That We Have One Of The Rooms That Was Not Under The Roof Eaves As We Knew That This Would Otherwise Render The Room Very Warm In The Hot Weather; So We Were Dismayed To Be Shown Up To The Very Room That We Had Wished To Avoid. Although We Were Shown An Alternative Room  This Was Not One Of The Other Junior State Rooms As Presumably By This Time The Other Two Were Already Occupied. There Was Clearly Therefore A Failure In Your Booking Process To Deliver What Had Originally Been Agreed.,,,,,
,4270,Gym Needs Updating Very Poor Equipment.  Disappointing To Have Had So Many Children Stay  Not As Relaxing For Adults.,,,,,
,4271,I Was Told There Would Be No Problem Getting A Cab At The Airport. This Was Not The Case. Had To Wait In The Rain And Then Join Another Person In Their Cab And Go 20 Minutes Out Of The Way Before Coming To Bovey.,,,,,
,4272,Excellent,,,,,
,4273,The Welcome Was Friendly  But Not What I Call Warm,,,,,
,4283,Absolutely Fantastic. All Staff Were A Credit To You  From Cleaners  Front Desk  Spa  Bars  Etc. No Issues At All.,,,,,
,4286,Arrival Was Fantastic! Staff Lovely. Would Have Liked A Bit More Information Regarding Our Stay Beforehand. Check In/ Out Times. Info About Lodges (I.E. They Came With Some Comp Groceries Which Was Great But Only Found That Out When I Asked). But This Was A Minor Minor Thing.,,,,,
,4289,Whilst The Team Was Pleasant On Arrival  It All Seemed Rather Amateurish In Comparison To Our Last Visit.,,,,,
,4292,I Had Booked In Advance That There Be A Bottle Of Lanson Champagne In Our Room On Arrival. This Was Not There On Arrival And When Champagne Arrived It Was Not Lanson  But Bollinger. Lanson Is Our Favourite Champagne And I Was Not Told When Booking That The Hotel Does Not Stock Lanson.,,,,,
,4301,Excellent Service On Arrival And Pre-Arrival Thank You.,,,,,
,4304,It Was Perfect,,,,,
,4305,Booking Was Efficient. We Arrived Early And Were Told That Our Room Would Be Made A Priority Butthat Didn't Happen.,,,,,
,4308,I Had Asked About The Possibility Of Bringing My Cats  But The Receptionist Was Not Sure About It. While There I Was Told It Would Have Been Fine To Bring Them. If I Had Known We Could Have Stayed An Extra Day Which Would Have Been Lovely.,,,,,
,4309,We Were Greeted By A Helpful  Friendly And Welcoming Gentlemen At The Door Who Answered All Our Questions And Were Accommodating And Professional,,,,,
,4310,Pre Arrival And Arrival Was Spot On And Very Efficient. Only 1 Issue No Milk In Fridge On Arrival.,,,,,
,4314,Felt Overwhelmed At First But Staff Soon Made Me Feel Totally At Ease.,,,,,
,4319,Great Pre Arrival Contact And Lovely Welcome,,,,,
,4323,Everyone I Spoke To On The Phone Gave Me Different Information.. One Told Me Stonehenge Was Only One Hour By Car Away.  It Is Certainly Not.,,,,,
,4328,Felt Welcome,,,,,
,4330,Everything Was Excellent - Very Attentive Staff And Made Arriving Hassle Free,,,,,
,4331,People Were Excellent.  Room Was Not Prepared For Our Arrival  Which Significantly Dampened Our Initial Impressions.,,,,,
,4332,We Arrived In The Midst Of The Christmas Fair  Which We Were Unaware Of When Booking  And This Made Checking In More Stressful Than Expected.,,,,,
,4338,Pre-Arrival Call Was Unexpected But A Nice Touch. Reception Were Always Very Friendly With Genuine Smiles Even When Obviously Busy.,,,,,
,4341,When We Arrived We Were Greeted By A Very Welcoming Young Man  Who Parked Our Car And Were Led To The Reception Area Where We Were Shown To Our Room By A Very Pleasant Young Lady And Were Offered A Tour Of The Hotel But Declined And Said We Would Find Our Own Way Around Once We Had Unpacked.  As It Was About 4 We Thought We Would Have Lovely Devon Tea  Which We Had Been Looking Forward To But Were Informed Rather Rudely That We Couldn't As We Hadn't Booked By A Gentleman In One Of The Lounges - Rather Odd We Thought As We Were A Resident Of The Hotel But Were Told That We Could Get A Cup Of Tea In The Snack Area.  Again And I Do Appreciate That There Was Going To Be A Function On The Outside Terrace  But That Was Not Until 6  We Were Met By A Very Stressed Lady And Not Entirely Professional In My View  Who Very Begrudgingly Let Us Sit Outside ( There Were Other People Sat Out) And Have A Cup Of Tea. Not The Best Of Starts To A Stay.,,,,,
,4344,The Staff We Saw Upon Arrival And Checking In Were Very Pleasant And Efficient.  We Particularly Liked The Tweed Uniforms.,,,,,
,4345,The Staff Know Me Very Well,,,,,
,4351,Everything Went Well And We Was Greeted With Warm Smiles,,,,,
,4352,N/A,,,,,
,4356,Excellent And Friendly Staff Who Assisted And Explained Arrangements For The Room As It Was Not Ready On Arrival. However  What They Did Not Tell Us Was That You Had A Conference In The Hotel. Our Room Was Situated Directly Above The Lounge Bar Area And We Were Disturbed Until 4.00Am. Simply To Have Ensured That Guest Rooms Did Not Be Compromised By Conference Visitors Would Have Solved This Matter,,,,,
,4362,Great Staff,,,,,
,4364,We Had A Tour Of The Hotel. And Were Told The Hotel Did A Cider And Sloe Gin Tasting Experience. We Were Very Impressed At This And The Guy Who Ran It. Shocked To Be Charged £40 For It When We Checked Out.,,,,,
,4368,I Arrived Later Than My Friends By Train  So They Had Already Checked In And I Went Immediately To Our Own Lodge.  I Did Not Therefore Have To Contact Reception Or Deal With Arrival Arrangements.  However Everyone I Came Into Contact With While In The Main Castle Or Grounds Were Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,4369,It Wasn't Easy To Understand All Because Noone Speaks German,,,,,
,4375,See Further Correspondance On The Clash With A Corporate Booking. Serious Compromise On The Stay,,,,,
,4376,My Boyfriend Had Already Checked In Before I Arrived  Whereby He Met Me And Took My Bags To My Room  At No Time At All Were Either Of Us Offered To Have Our Bags Taken To Our Rooms For Us.  We Watched Other People Checking In And They Were Offered To Be Escorted To Their Rooms  Their Bags Carried For Them And A Tour Of Bovey Castle  None Of Which Was Offered To Us.,,,,,
,4377,On Arrival Greeted By Staff At Vehicle They Removed Luggage And Friendly Attitude  Check In Was Fast And Professional Also Given Tour Of Facilities. Cannot Be Faulted  Well Done To All 1St Impressions Count And We Were Impressed !!!,,,,,
,4382,I Arrived The Day After My Husband And So I Did Not Have To Check In As Such. There Was A Key Waiting For Me But I Was Not Asked If I Had Any Luggage That Needed To Be Taken To The Room.,,,,,
,4385,We Arrived Late At Night  With A Young Family  And It Was Very Dark  And Even Though We Were Booked As Self Serve Clients  Any Reasonable Establishment Would Have Assisted With Finding And Moving Into Our Lodging. We Were Left To Stumble Around In The Dark.,,,,,
,4388,So Well Organised - Felt Relaxed The Moment We Drove Up To The Door!,,,,,
,4390,We Did Seem To Wait A Very Long Time To Get Our Rooms  With Others In Our Party Arriving Later And Getting Their Rooms Before Us.,,,,,
,4393,Top Class Service Throughout,,,,,
,4398,First Class,,,,,
,4399,We Were Guided Throughout The Hotel And Everything Was Explained To Us. We Felt Very Welcome,,,,,
,4400,It Was Great To Have A Phone Call Before The Stay That Showed True Class,,,,,
,4406,It Was Not Pointed Out That The Brasserie Would Not Be Open During Our Stay  Leaving Us No Alternative To Eating In The Over Priced Main Restaurant.,,,,,
,4408,Need To Improve,,,,,
,4414,Staff Were Extremely Accommodating During Booking By Answering Questions And Figuring Out Best Accommodation. Upon Arrival  Jake Quickly Took Care Of Us And Escorted Us To Our Room.  Matt Brought The Luggage Up And Helped Us Get Settled With An Extra Luggage Rack And Info On The Hotel.,,,,,
,4415,I Had Rang And Made The Dinner Bookings Several Days Before A Arrival. The Day Before I Got A Phone Call Asking Which Restaurants & Times We Wanted But Also Saying They Had Already Booked Us Into The Bistro At 7Pm Both Evenings. There Was Then Some Confusion As They Hadn't Checked The Other Reservations I Had Made. If The Staff Member Had Pre-Checked Before Calling Me It Would Have Been Better.,,,,,
,4419,The Staff Seemed Efficient But Failed To Deliver. We Asked If It Was Possible To Arrange Clay Pigeon Shooting But No One Got Back To Us.,,,,,
,4435,Very Pleasant And Efficient.  The Only Slight Problem Was That You Seemed To Be Expecting Three Of Us.  This Seems To Have Been A Problem With The Booking Agent Although My Confirmation Showed Only Two Adults.  But You Dealt With It Quickly And Well,,,,,
,4436,Its Always A Little Complicated To Find A Suitable Package For Me And My Family,,,,,
,4438, We Are Regular Guests At Bovey Castle  Approx 6 Times Over The Past 3 Years  However This Is Not Recognised By The Check In Or Greeting Staff  For Returning Guests It Is Very Important That They Are Greeted With The Staff Acknowledging This,,,,,
,4440,The Receptionists Could Be More Warm  Welcoming And Friendly But The Young Man Taking Our Bag From The Car And Up To The Room Was Friendly And Professional - Offering To Show Us Around The Hotel After We'd Settled In And Pointing Out The Facilities In The Room.,,,,,
,4442,All Staff Were So Welcoming We Were Greeted At The Main Entrance And The Only Thing I Had To Do Was Hand My Car Keys Over Everyone Was So Friendly Nothing Was Any Trouble.,,,,,
,4445,Very Efficient At Reception And Concierge.,,,,,
,4450,Please See My Previous Email To Joanna.,,,,,
,4451,The Staff In Their Wonderful Non Stuffy Uniforms Was Lovely And They Could Not Do Enough For Us,,,,,
,4452,Matthew In The Bar Was Exceptional In Terms Of Service And General Attitude And Helpfulness.,,,,,
,4454,No,,,,,
,4458,Was Delighted To Have Our Room Upgraded,,,,,
,4459,Not Very Organised On Arrival And Dealt With By So Many Staff With No Consistency That It Was Not Suprising That No One Was Aware What Was Happening. We Had Our Afternoon Tea Order And Service By Four Members Of Staff So The Tea Came 40 Minutes Before The Sandwiches And Cakes. Similarly We Were Advised That We Could Have Our Lunch Pre Spa Treatments Then Much Took 35 Mins To Arrive Leaving Us Just 20 Mins Before The Spa  As We Were U Able To Put The Spa Treatment Times Back. This Just Emphasised The Impression Of A Fragmented And Poorly Co- Pedometer Service. Lovely Place Lovely Decor Poor Service Let You Down,,,,,
,4466,Excellent Service All Round,,,,,
,4467,Very Courteous Reception From Smatly Dressed Gentleman,,,,,
,4469,The Older Of The Golf Shop Staff Members Needs Some Training From Your Reception Staff About How To Speak To Customers - He Was The Only Blot On Our Stay. It Is A Long Time Since I Have Been Spoken To In Such A Demeaning  Public Ie In The Bistro  And Unprofessional Way By Anyone. Your Reception Staff Are Exemplary And Should Teach Him How To Interact Properly.,,,,,
,4471,We Have Always Found The Staff At Reception To Be Friendly Helpful And Welcoming,,,,,
,4472,Not Met At Door Had To Ask For Bags From Car. Not Given Any Information As To Events Or General Information,,,,,
,4480,Reception Staff Were Welcoming And Helpful,,,,,
,4481,Booking Was Efficient On Arrival We Were Greeted Immediately Outside And Our Car And Luggage Taken Care Of Friendly,,,,,
,4491,We Were Contacted The Previous Evening To Confirm Our Reservation And Meal Requirements  But Unfortunately A Call Back Request Was Not Carried Out As We Wanted To Know About Upgrading Our Room. This Had No Detrimental Effect To Our Stay.,,,,,
,4492,My Wife And I Were Treated Very Well At All Times  The Staff Were Extremely Efficient  Polite And Helpfull.,,,,,
,4493,We Did Not Appreciate One Of The Resot Team Using The F Word While Telling Us A Story About Beakey The Parrot It Was Unprofessional And Completely Unexpected And Affected Our Stay Initally,,,,,
,4495,It Was A Very Nice Touch To Telephone A Couple Of Days In Advance Regarding Dinner Reservations Although My Immediate Thought Was That You Were Going To Say There Was A Problem With The Booking.,,,,,
,4499,Had A Bit Of Difficulty In Finding Bovey Castle Via Sat Nav And Directions .,,,,,
,4503,Cannot Understand Why A 5% Service Charge - Service Is What The Hotel Business Is All About Anyway - That Is What You Pay For.  And The Staff Said That They Did Not Receive It - Or Definitely Not All Of It.  Secondly There Is No Real Indication Anywhere That It Is A Hotel Designed For Dog-Lovers.  That Is Fine  But That Is What You Should Advertise The Hotel As  So As Not To Mislead.,,,,,
,4504,I Wasn't Made Aware Of Difficult The Hotel Is To Find So It Took A Long Time To Find It!,,,,,
,4505,No Issues In This Area,,,,,
,4508,Pre Arrival Was Very Good I.E. Email And Telephone Call. Upon Arrival  It Would Have Been Lovely To Have Greated At Our Car  With An Umbrella And To Have Offered Assitance With The Luggage. This Happened When We Stayed At Le Manoir And Was An Excellent Touch.,,,,,
,4512,Some Guest Were Shown Around The Hotel  We Were Just Shown To Our Room,,,,,
,4522,All Very Good,,,,,
,4523,Yes  We Stayed In A Lodge. It Was Awesome. However  You Could Not Drive To The Door With Your Cases And Provisions. It Was Pouring With Rain When We Arrived And Dark (After 4Pm Check-In). We Had Real Trouble Finding The Right Lodge (The Name Was Barely Visible) And We Drove As Close As We Could. We Then Clambered Up The Mud Bank To Get To The Door With All The Cases Etc. It Was Quite An Exercise! I Think You Should Offer To Bring The Luggage To The Door With A Golf Buggy Or Vehicle  Particularly Fro The Elderly.,,,,,
,4526,Very Poor Lounge Service Upon Arrival - Check In Desk Was Fine,,,,,
,4527,We Did Not Receive A Confirmation Email After We Booked,,,,,
,4528,Reservations Team (Over The Telephone) Were Very Helpful,,,,,
,4531,Felt A Little Hurried And Had A Slight Feeling Of The Staff Being A Little 'All Over Us',,,,,
,4533,Amy Ghazala Was Extremely Helpful And Kind To Me Prior To My Arrival And During My Entire Stay! She Is An Exceptional And A Wonderful  Kind And Caring Representative For Bovey!,,,,,
,4537,Well I'm So Glad You Have Sent Me This Survey To Fill In As My Room Was A  Shocking And I Have Stay In Mouse Luxury Hotels All Over The Uk & Around The World Your Hotel Was The Worst Ever For The Cost Of The Room Ieee,,,,,
,4539,No  Polite Staff.,,,,,
,4540,Unfortunately  We Arrived On An Exclusive Event Day  So We Weren't Allowed Access To The Castle And Much Effort Was Made To Keep Us Away.  While We Understood The Issue  It Was A Bit Of An Uncomfortable Feeling.  The Castle Staff Was Quite Pleasant  But Also Unfortunately Our Concierge Had Been Crowned A Week Prior And Seemed Quite Overwhelmed.  Not Being From The Area Or The Country For That Matter -- She Wasn't Able To Offer The Details That Can Often Make Or Break A Visit.,,,,,
,4543,I Arrived At 11Am And Was Told That They Would Try And Get The Room Ready Early As Check In Was Not Until 3Pm (Which I Was Not Aware Of).  I Was Then Told  That The Rooms Were Being Cleaned In Order Down The Corridor So I Would Have To Wait.  The Wait Felt Long And We Felt A At A Loose End During That Time.  However  Once We Got Into Our Room The Whole Experience Changed.,,,,,
,4551,Despite Mentioning On Booking That Our Party Of 6 Were Celebrating A Special Birthday  No Recognition Of This Was Evident On Arrival  And The Booking Party Had The Smallest Room Without A View- So Poor Attention To Detail  Unlike The Local Pub That Made The Celebration Special!,,,,,
,4553,No,,,,,
,4561,Every Time We Had To Get Through The 'Back Entrance' (Oneway Road) To Our Loge  The Main Entrance Was Barricaded By Audi. We Never Had The Opportunity To Enter The Castle.,,,,,
,4568,It Took A While To Make The Booking As No One Answered The Phone,,,,,
,4576,Parking Is Disorganised Cones Everywhere No Parking Signs Where Cars Are Parked I Had To Move Cones Next Morning To Get Car In. No One Around To Advise.,,,,,
,4584,This Was Our Fifth Or Sixth Visit To Bovey Castle So We Know What To Expect.  This Time The Service Fell Down In Almost Every Area And We Left Feeling Very Disappointed.  There Was No One To Greet Us When We Arrived  No One Came Out To Valet Park Or Take Our Bags.  We Checked In But Since Our Room Was Not Ready Went Out For A Country Walk. When We Returned Our Bags Were Not In Our Room.  We Phoned Reception To Ask For Them To Be Brought Up And 25 Minutes Later They Still Had Not Arrived.  On Phoning Again We Were Told That One Receptionist Had Told The Other That Our Bags Had Been Taken Up.  Since She Thought That Had Happened She Did Not Instruct Anyone To Take Up The Bags.,,,,,
,4588,The Decoration Is Begining To Look Tired And You Can See No Money Has Been Spent On The Bedrooms And There Has Been Some Water Ingress,,,,,
,4590,If There Was Pannier Champagne At The Bar I Would Have Then Heard Angels Sing.,,,,,
,4592,Valet And Reception Made Our Arrival Very Pleasant After A Long Journey And Trouble Locating The Hotel. Local Signage Very Poor. Sad To Say Valet Service When Departing Was Poor. We Had To Load The Car. Got Impression That Valet Staff Not Interested After The Bill Has Been Paid And They Are Only Interested In New Arrivals.,,,,,
,4595,On Being Shown To Our Room We Discovered That The Safe Was Missing - This Was Very Inconvenient To Me. I Had To Either Carry My Purse And Jewellery Around With Me Or Leave It At Reception And Keep Asking For It Back. Theses Things Happen But I Began My Stay Irritated And My Mood Was Not Helped Shortly Later - Please See Question 23.,,,,,
,4596,Room Was Not Ready (2.30Pm),,,,,
,4597,Room Was Not Ready. We Went To The Bar And Were Then Ignored By Reception Until I Went Back To Reception To Enquire About Progress. We Were Then Told That The Room Was Ready  But Nobody Had Bothered To Tell Us! It Also Took Too Long For Our Luggage To Arrive In The Room.,,,,,
,4598,Had An Awesome Time. Loved The Castle  Grounds And Staff Were All Amazing,,,,,
,4605,It Would Have Been Greatly Appreciated If The Staff Had Strongly Recommended Booking The Main Dining Room Immediately  So That We Could Have Eaten There In The Evening.  Instead We Asked Too Late In The Day And Only 6.30 Or 8.45 For The Main Dining Room Was Available  But My Sister Was Having A Treatment When My Other Sister And I Asked About Dining Arrangements So We Couldnt Manage 6.30 And 8.45 Was Too Late For Us To Eat.,,,,,
,4607,Staff Did Not Sort Out Our Spa Bookings As Asked  Nor Recommend Very Helpfully  Nor Get Back To Me As Promised When I Telephoned In The Week Prior To Our Visit.  However  Once We Arrived  The Staff Could Not Have Been More Friendly And Helpful  Especially Ben Who Initially Showed Us Around.,,,,,
,4608,A Detailed Map Of The Locality Would Be Useful - Supplied On Your Website.,,,,,
,4609,It Was Lovely To Be Greeted And The Car Taken Away For Us.,,,,,
,4610,No,,,,,
,4613,Arrival And Pre Arrival Contact Was Good.,,,,,
,4620,All Excellent And Helpful,,,,,
,4622,The Door Men Were Friendly But The Receptionist Was Unhelpful And Unfriendly. When We Asked Where The Toilets Were She Just Pointed Down The Corridor And She Did The Same To Indicate The Bistro. At No Time Were We Shown Around The Hotel Nor Were We Given A Map Off The Grounds. I Have Never Experienced Such A Poor Welcome Before.,,,,,
,4624,I Was Called The Week Before To Ask If I Wanted To Organise Anything Whilst Staying  Was In The Middle Of A Party So Asked For A Call Back  This Did Not Happen And When I Called To Book My Spa Treatment I Couldn't Have What I Wanted As The Treatment I Wanted Was Too Long And They Had No Space For The Time I Required.. We Arrived Mid Afternoon And We Still Had To Wait For Our Room As It Wasn't Ready..,,,,,
,4625,Well Done To You All,,,,,
,4627,Your Reception Staff Were The Only Staff To Share A Joke With My Husband And Myself  As I Had Forgotten My Purse So Did Not Have My Debit Card To Hand.  When Passed To Someone To Show Us Around  She Kindly Re-Booked My Spa Treatment  But Actively Encouraged Us To Have A Relaxing Drink Before Showing Us Around - But We Felt We Were Being 'Palmed Off' And That She Did Not Want To Bother.,,,,,
,4630,Very Nice To Be Greeted By The Young Man  Efficient Removal Of Luggage Swiftly Taken To Room. Pleasant Young Lady On Reception. Room Ready Even Though I Arrived A Bit Early. Was Offered A Tour Most Helpful.,,,,,
,4632,It Was A Horrendously Windy Day And The Staff Were Very Helpful In Collecting Our Luggage And Were Courteous And Friendly.,,,,,
,4634,We M Iss The Owl On The Reception Desk.,,,,,
,4644,It Was Nice To Just Hand Over The Car Keys And Have The Luggage Taken To Our Room,,,,,
,4652,There Seemed To Be Confusion As To Whether Our Child's Meal Was Included For The Supplement We Had Paid And This Was Frustrating And Created Unnecessary Stress.,,,,,
,4658,I Was Promised A Valley View Castle Room When I Booked With Travel Zoo Offer As I Was One Of The First To Take Up The Offer But On Arrival We Were Given A Room Overlooking The Courtyard. I Contacted Reception And They Offered Me An Upgrade For £40 Which I Paid To Ensure A View.,,,,,
,4659,Very Warm And Pleasant Welcome On Arrival - Greatly Appreciated,,,,,
,4660,We Arrived At 11.45 Am. It Seemed A Long Time To Wait For Room To Be Available (3.05P.M.)  Particularly As All Tables In Lounge Laid For Tea And We Were Asked To Vacate Lounges At 2.45P.M.,,,,,
,4661,Reception Staff Were Friendly And Helpful  Especially When I Complained About Not Being Able To Eat In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,4664,A Warm Welcome Received From All The Staff,,,,,
,4674,Green Cones Everywhere Ruined The Entrance /Arrival Car Park And Look   Not A Fitting Tribute To Such A Grand Old Place,,,,,
,4675,We Were Put In A Rather Strange And Unexpected Room  No 1  On Arrival  Not Anything Like The Standard Of Room We Have Been Allocated Before  And Certainy Not Up To Your Usual Standard. The Bed Was Not Make Up Into Twins As Requested  ( I Had To Re-Assure My Son It Would Be) Even Though I Had Asked For This In Advance. But The Upgrade  And Price Offered For An Upgrade   Was Very Reasonable Under The Circumstances.,,,,,
,4677,We Had Our Two Little Pups With Us And One Of Them Was Only 9 Weeks Old.  The Front Desk Took Care Of Them While We Went In And Had Lunch.  I Was Really Impressed With Such Hospitality.  Thank You.,,,,,
,4678,We Were Promised That There Would Be Bikes We Could Use But There Were None At All,,,,,
,4683,Everything Conducted Professionally And In A Very Welcoming Manner.,,,,,
,4684,I Would Like To Thank The Management & Staff For Making My Stay  At Bovey Castle One To Cherish And Share With All My Friends All Over The World,,,,,
,4691,This Visit Was An Improvement On Previous Visits Which Were Good,,,,,
,4692,Could Not Ask For Better,,,,,
,4697,It Far Exceeded Expectations And Was A Great Start To Our Stay,,,,,
,4698,Welsh Greeter Was Very Good,,,,,
,4710,I Think The Staff Could Use More Training; At Times It Was Disorganized (People Who'd Just Arrived In The Bar Served Before Those Waiting 15 Min Plus As An Example).  The Edwardian Grill Definitely Needs A Good Bus Person - Way Too Many Soiled Dishes On Tables  Tables Not Set Up  With People Waiting For Breakfast (Saturday Morning).  All The Staff We Met Were Friendly  Helpful  And Wanted To Please.  That Part Was Outstanding.,,,,,
,4711,Would Have Preferred To Have Been Given The Option To Have Our Car Parked  Rather Than Assume That We Would Allow Anyone Else To Drive It. We Appreciated Having A Call Prior To Our Arrival To Confirm All Was Ok.,,,,,
,4717,As Complained Very Poor Welcome Very Rushed Entrance And Unacceptable That We Could Not Even Get In The Room Then Having Complained Of The Room Standard And Requested Change Staff Very Unhelpful And Uninterested.,,,,,
,4718,The Staff Were Not Efficient But They Did Make Our Arrival Easy. The Staff Were Friendly But Not Professional.,,,,,
,4719,The Porter Who Assisted Us And Brought Our Luggage To Our Room Was Extremely Good.  The Receptionist On Check-In Was Very Good.,,,,,
,4721,Don't Like Pushy Way Approached On The Drive.,,,,,
,4724,I Did Not Like The Caged Birds At The Reception.,,,,,
,4728,At The Point Of Booking And One Week Prior To Arrival (During Pre-Arrival Contact)  We Explained That For Medical Reason We Needed Our Room To Be Feather Free (Hypo-Allergenic Bedding). On Both Occasions We Were Assured This Would Be Arranged. On Arrival We Were Very Disappointed To Discover Feather Pillows And Feather Duvet On The Bed. When We Flagged This To Housekeeping They Said That The Request Had Not Been Passed On To Them. They Eventually Managed To Find A Non-Feather Quilt But It Was A Double Sized Quilt On A King Sized Bed  The Pillows Were Fairly Hard And Uncomfortable Foam Pillows. In This Day And Age It Is Not Difficult Or Expensive To Get Nice Quality Hollow Fibre Bedding. Had We Not Double Checked  My Wife Would Probably Have Suffered An Asthma Attack.,,,,,
,4729,The Only Issue I Would Complain About Was The Hotel Was Difficult To Find And We Would Of Appreciated Better Signage Along The Route.,,,,,
,4732,We Did Not Feel That We Were A Valued Customer And Whilst Waiting For Our Room To Be Made Available We Spent Some 10 Minutes In The Oak Room Before Any Staff Made Any Effort To Ask If We Required Anything.,,,,,
,4737,I Was Contacted Pre Arrival Which Was A Nice Touch.  However My Room Wasn't Ready When I Pitched Up At 1.40 P.M.,,,,,
,4739,We Did'nt Like Our Room As It Was Next To The Kitchen Extractor...Noisy At 6Am And We Like Our Bedroom Windows Open. We Were Given Another Room Which Was Lovely  Looking Over The Garden And It Was All Sorted Out Very Quickly And Efficiently.,,,,,
,4742,Reservations Clerk Was Very Helpful And Suggested A Ground Room Be Allocated For Our Stay When I Explained My Mobility Problems.,,,,,
,4744,Have Sent Separate Email With Further Comments About My Arrival And The Failure To Fulfil My Pre Arrival Requests.,,,,,
,4746,Our Greeting Upon Arrival And Pre Arrival Contact Was Excellent.,,,,,
,4747,No It Was Fine,,,,,
,4748,The First Room We Were Given Was Too Small And Had Hot Mug Stains On The Wooden Unit And Wasn't Worth The Money We Had Paid.  We Were However Moved To Room 47 Which Was Lovely.,,,,,
,4752,On Arrival We Were Told By Adam He Would Give Us A Tour Of Hotel Before Showing Us To Our Room.  This Didn't Happen Our Luggage Was Taken To Our Room And We Were Left Waiting In Reception  Eventually We Found Some-One To Take Us To Our Room!,,,,,
,4753,All Golf Bags Were Not Taken To Pro Shop,,,,,
,4757,Excellent All-Round Service And A Bonus To See The Little Owl Sat At The Reception.,,,,,
,4762,Loved The Owl!!,,,,,
,4763,The Staff Welcomed Us In The Car Park Which Was A Very Nice Touch.,,,,,
,4764,We Managed To Park  Retrieve Our Suitcases And Arrive At The Door Before We Met Anyone Which Was Fine By Us  Though Afterwards Found Out It Was Supposed To Be 'Valet Parking'.,,,,,
,4765,Did Not Really Need Our Bag To Be Taken To Our Room And We Were Not Given The Choice - This Felt A Little Intrusive.,,,,,
,4768,Unfortun(Ely The First Allocated Room (5) Was Completely Unacceptable. One Does Not Come From The Continent To Get A Room At The Rear With The Window Blocked My Next Door's Roof. Keep It For Staff Purposes. The Alternative Room (2) Was Acceptable. This Did Really Spoil Our Feeling Of Being Welcome.,,,,,
,4775,We Were A Group Of 3 Couples And Were Given Rooms On 3 Floors!,,,,,
,4777,Excellent Stay Falconry Experience Fantastic!,,,,,
,4779,Parked Own Car As No One To Greet Us. Shown To Room By Receptionist But Not Shown Over Areas Of Hotel  Ie Bar  Sitting Rooms  Dining Areas Etc  Not Invited To Make A Booking For Evening Meal  We Made The Request Ourselves After Reading The Information Pack In Our Room!,,,,,
,4781,The Reception Staff Were Very Friendly & Took Time Out To Explain About Bovey Castle & The Surrounding Area Even Though We Could See They Were Extremely Busy.  We Dined In The Edwardian Grill Restaurant & After Being Seated & Our Order Taken We Decided That We Would Like To Move Table  Which Was Accommodated Without Any Trouble.  Both Chris & I Would Like To Say A Big Thank You To Them All For Making Our Stay So Enjoyable.  Kind Regards  Chris & Jackie Stevenson ,,,,,
,4782,Our Experiences Were Quite Mixed.  There Appeared To Be A Car Sales Going On When We Arrived Which Seemed To Delay The Delivery Of Our Luggage To The Room.  I Have A Mobility Problem And Required A Room With A Disabled Bathroom;  Room One Was Given To Me.  That Room Was Reasonable; It Had Lovely Views Of The Grounds And A Large Comfortable Bed  However I Was Disappointed To Find That I Was Required To Move A Very Heavy Chair In Order To Open/Use The Windows Or Move Around The Desk Area Easily.  The Shower Area Was Useful  And Worked Well For My Needs.  A Football Game We Were Interested In Seeing Was Available In The Bistro  And We Able To Enjoy That Relaxed Environment While We Waited For Our Luggage.,,,,,
,4783,When We Arrived There Was A Car Sales Taking Place In The Courtyard Which Seemed To Cause A Delay In The Delivery Of Our Luggage To Our Room.  The Grounds Were Lovely And Well-Kept.  The Exterior Of The Building Was Impressive.  The Reception Area Was Narrow And There Was Nowhere For Me To Sit.  I Have Difficulty Walking And Standing  So This Was Uncomfortable For Me. Fortunately  The Football Game That We Wanted To Watch Was Being Shown In The Bistro  So We Were Able To Enjoy This Relaxing Area While We Awaited The Arrival Of Our Luggage.,,,,,
,4788,Hotel Arranged Pick Up And Drop Off At Exeter Train Station. It Was All Very Easy And Efficient.,,,,,
,4790,We Love Everyone From Federico To Polly  Vicky And Actually Everybody Whou Works There You Have The Most Brilliant Staff,,,,,
,4799,Staff Behind Reception Were Professional But Not Very Welcoming,,,,,
,4801,All Contact Excellent.,,,,,
,4803,Room Assigned Was Disappointing,,,,,
,4808,Your People Were Wonderful,,,,,
,4809,Having A Baby Own Tethered To The Reception Desk Was Awful  My Partner Nearly Leant On It As He Did Not Realise It Was Real.  Reception Is Tatty And Not Up To A Standard Your Profess To Have.,,,,,
,4812,It Was Pouring Down When We Arrived The Staff Seemed A Little Taken A Back By This A Couple Of Suggestions 1. Install A Retracable Canopy Which Extends Out To The Car In Adverse Weather 2. Buy Very Large Umberellas,,,,,
,4816,Good Welcoming Informative Contacts  Made,,,,,
,4817,Room Was Still Not Ready At 3:00,,,,,
,4818,Extremely Professional And Welcoming - Could Not Have Done Anything More.,,,,,
,4821,All Went Very Smoothly,,,,,
,4830,Initially We Didn't Like The Room We Were Allocated So Asked If We Could Pay For An Upgraded Room. This Was Handled With Great Efficiency And Friendliness By The Staff So That There Was No Problem Or Issue At All And It Was Their Pleasure To Find Us A Room We Liked. That Attitude Counts For A Huge Amount - Well Done.,,,,,
,4833,Excellent.,,,,,
,4842,Liked The Dress Of The Staff.,,,,,
,4843,No  All Staff Very Friendly And Welcoming.,,,,,
,4845,The Only Reason For 2 Rather Than 1 Above Was That The Room Was Not Ready When We Arrived At About 12.45 Although The Hotel Was Far From Full.,,,,,
,4846,Federico & Polly Led In Our Welcome & Enjoyment Throughout.,,,,,
,4847,We Were Unhappy That We Were Discovered An Offer On Your Web Site That We Were Not Offered.,,,,,
,4848,See My Comments On Tripadvisor Re Poor Supervision Of Staff And The Absence Of Visible Management.,,,,,
,4855,On Arrival Was Only Given Slip Of Paper With Pool Code. Taken Up To Room. Not Given A Key. Key Was Fetched But It Was The Wrong Key. Kept Waiting. As We Were Late Arriving It Was Quite Irritating And Appeared Inefficient On The Part Of The Hotel Staff.,,,,,
,4856,All Perfect,,,,,
,4859,Very Accommodating - We Had To Change The Weekend Date - Reservation Replied Immediately - All Our Requests Rue Our Dog And Dinner Booking Was Deals With Promptly Beforehand Too,,,,,
,4867,Excellent Greeting Staff  However I Found Them Slightly Intrusive  When You Have Just Been Travelling For Several Days Or Just Flown Into The Country  It Would Be Good To Be Allowed Some Time To Sort Out Your Belongings And Not Be Put Under Pressure.,,,,,
,4868,No,,,,,
,4872,Reception Was Not On The Ball! After We Checked In And Walked To Our Lodge We Could Not Enter As We Were Not Given The Key And So Had To Walk Back To Reception To Collect. The Next Day We Decided To Visit The Spa. We Were Not Given The Code To Enter By Reception Staff And Again Had To Walk Back And Then On Arrival We Hadn't Been Told About The Key For The Lockers But In Frustration We Did Not Bother Walking Back Again. In Conversation With A Friend Who Came For A Spa Day She Had Had A Similar Experience With The Reception And Was Not Happy!,,,,,
,4879,Fantastic Staff Could Not Do Enough,,,,,
,4886,Car Valet And Luggage Was All Taken Care Of Which Made My Arrival Special.,,,,,
,4889,All Fantastic!,,,,,
,4894,Pre-Arrival I Had Booked The Wine Tasting And Cocktail Making Classes By Email Which Was Picked Up By Ashlie Who Was Very Friendly And Helpful. It Was Also Lovely That When We Arrived And I Mentioned That We Were Doing The Wine Tasting That Day Ashlie Immediately Remembered My Name And What Else We Had Planned Which Was Very Impressive And Very Professional.,,,,,
,4895,Please See My Previous Comments.,,,,,
,4898,Very Professional  Warm And Helpful,,,,,
,4900,We Had A Slight Mix Up On What Time The Pool Opened One Morning As We Were Told 08.30 Which Was Too Late For Us As We Had A Busy Day Ahead.,,,,,
,4901,We Arrived In Two Separate Parties In The Early Evening.  The First Party Was Taken To The Down Tor Lodge By Your Doorman And This Went Well.  The Second Party Arrived After Us And Did Not Receive The Same Treatment.  They Were Given Verbal Directions To The Lodge  Which Proved Very Difficult To Find At Night  And Worse The Woman At The Front Desk Instructed Our Friends To Park In The Lot And Carry Their Heavy Luggage To The Lodge.  She Did Not Have The Courtesy To Ask Them To Wait For The Doorman.,,,,,
,4905,Brilliant The Way Our Luggage Got To Our Room Before Us,,,,,
,4906,We Stayed In Rose Cottage And Loved It..My Only Comment Would Be That A Small Welcome Pack Would Have Been Nice So That After A Long Journey We Could Have Instantly Put The Kettle On For A Cuppa And A Bickie Or Two.....,,,,,
,4907,We Received A Phone Call Prior To Our Visit To See If There Was Anything That Could Of Been Done To Make Our Stay More Comfortable Which Although We Had No Requests Was A Nice Gesture.,,,,,
,4908,No,,,,,
,4913,When We Arrived At 1 Pm We Were Told That Our Lodge Would Be Ready Soon And That We Should Have Lunch. We Had Lunch  Waited For Ages  Our Little Children Were Tired Nobody Bothered To Tell Us When The Lodge Was Actually. I Went To Find Out And Was Finally Told That Yes  It Was Ready 30 Mins Ago!,,,,,
,4915,Would Have Been Nice If Our Rooms Were Available Early But Understand Why It Was Not.,,,,,
,4918,Phone Call From Ella Giving Different Times For Dinner Reservations. Had To Call Hotel Again To Confirm What Times I Had Booked Previously,,,,,
,4925,We Are Writing To You Separately To Give You Sepcific Detail Of Our Pre Arrival Contact.,,,,,
,4929,All Said On Previous Question  Excellent. ,,,,,
,4937,No,,,,,
,4940,No,,,,,
,4942,No. ,,,,,
,4947,A Sign On Arrival Offering Valet Parking Would Be Useful,,,,,
,4953,Very Good,,,,,
,4954,Where To Park The Car Was Not Clear.  We Were Not Met Upon Arrival And A Lot Of The Car Parking Area Was Off Limits.,,,,,
,4955,See Previous Comments  The Coldness Of The Welcome Ruined The Stay From The Beginning. The Hotel Was Almost Empty But The Receptionist Spent More Time Chatting To Friends At The Bar Than Helping Guests,,,,,
,4956,Very Nice Call Two Days Before We Arrived To Sort Dinner Reservations Etc.,,,,,
,4957,Very Welcoming. We Appreciated The Tour Given By William (?). Thank You For Upgrading Our Room.,,,,,
,4958,Should Provide Pre-Arriving Info To Explain Parking Etc,,,,,
,4959,It Wasn't Clear Where To Park,,,,,
,4966,I Did Like My Room And It Had A Great View  But If You Wanted To Improve The Bedrooms And Bathrooms Could Do With That Extra Plush Look That The Rest Of The Hotel Gives. ,,,,,
,4972,Very Impressed That Federico Stayed Late To Welcome Us. Beyond The Call Of Duty!,,,,,
,4974,Nil  Only Complaint Was Very Slow Service ,,,,,
,4983,Tried To Ring Reservations A Couple Of Times To Try And Get There A Little Earlier And The Girl At Reception Kept Saying I Will Put You Through But The Reservations Line Never Seemed To Be Manned. The Receptionist Should Know That Reservations Are Not Working Between Particular Hours. When My Wife Did Leave A Message No One At Reservations Rang Her Back Which Prompted Me To Eventually Ring And Get Through. Other Members In Our Party Had The Same Problem As We Did And In The End Booked Alternative Accommodation I Felt The Reception Staff Should Know If Reservations Personel Are In Or Not And Not Have Me Leave A Message Only Not To Get It Answered,,,,,
,4984,Per Arrival Phone Call To Check Details Appreciated,,,,,
,4985,Orr Arrival Contact Was Nice But Didn't T Herat It Til After Arrival,,,,,
,4986,Only The Staff From The Edwardian Grill Was Amazing! ,,,,,
,4994,We Both Wery Much Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,
,4997,I Was Pleasantly Surprised The Hotel Called Shortly Before Our Arrival Date To See If There Was Anything We Needed,,,,,
,4998,Sorry But I Had To Go And Find Extra Toilet Paper As The Room Was For A Family Of Four We Only Had One Roll Of Toilet Paper And It Ran Out Which Was A Little Awkward.  ,,,,,
,4999,No,,,,,
,5003,Courtesy Call Prior To Arrival Was A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,5016,Some Visitors Were Driven Down To Their Lodges  Whilst Others Were Asked To Drive / Walk By Themselves. Obviously It Was Very Nice To Be Driven Down And We Weren't Expecting This Service But It Would Be Good If The Same Level Of Service Was Given To Everyone As Some People Were Walking About In The Dark And The Rain Trying To Read Maps,,,,,
,5019,No,,,,,
,5022,Our Luggage Was Taken Away On Arrival And Not Delivered To Our Room As Stated. We Had To Prompt The Staff After A Half-An-Hour Delay. Totally Unsatisfactory,,,,,
,5023,When We Arrived In Our Car We Were Greeted As Soon As We Stopped Outside The Building Which Was Very Nice  But We Then Felt We Needed A Moment On Our Own After A Very Long Drive Just To Collect Our Thoughts And Think What We Had To Do  But We Weren't Given Any Space  And We Felt A Bit Rushed. ,,,,,
,5024,Fantastic 10 Out 10,,,,,
,5025,Keep Up The Good Work ,,,,,
,5028,Best Hotel I Have Ever Been Too,,,,,
,5030,Excellent.,,,,,
,5031,No.,,,,,
,5036,Arrival Was Quite Good!,,,,,
,5037,Communication  Either Email Or By Phone Was Easy And I Had Messages Back Very Quickly.  ,,,,,
,5039,The Team At Bovey Are A Pleasure. Frederick And His Team Make It Their Business To Make Your Stay Fantastic. ,,,,,
,5041,Does Your Solicitor Or Builder Make A Service Charge?,,,,,
,5042,No All Great,,,,,
,5044,Staff Meeting And Greeting Us On Arrival And Parking Our Car Was A Really Great Start To Our Stay ,,,,,
,5048,All Fine,,,,,
,5049,Very Helpful,,,,,
,5050,We Arrived In The Dark In The Middle Of A Storm  And It Had Not Been Easy To Find The Hotel. Our Sat Nav Took The A38 Route And Did Not Have Bovey Castle Or Hotel Or Golf Course As Recognised Destinations  So We Got Lost In North Bovey And Had To Find Someone To Get Directions. There Are Not Enough Signs To Bc In The Immediate Area  And The Directions To Bc On Your Website Are Not Good Enough. The Directions Have To Be Re-Written With These Extreme Circumstances In Mind. ,,,,,
,5053,Very Efficient Arrival And Staff Very Friendly- It Would Have Helped If The Member Of Staff Had Told Us We Could Park Up By The House Rather Than Having To Unload Everything And Carry It Up The Stairs,,,,,
,5055,Pre-Arrival Contact On The Telephone Was Welcoming  Helpful And Professional.  We Arrived In Stormy Weather. The Contrast On Entering The Building Was Striking; Warm Cosy And Welcoming.,,,,,
,5057,We Arrived In The Dark And In The Middle Of A Storm. We Had Difficulty Finding The Hotel In Such Poor Visibility And Our Sat Nav Had Taken Us Down The A38 To Approach It. Our Sat Nav Also Did Not Have The Castle  The Hotel Or The Golf Course As Destinations Under Your Post Code So We Found Ourselves In North Bovey.    The Directions On Your Website Are Not Good Enough For Someone Trying To Find The Place In Extreme Conditions  And There Are Not Nearly Enough Signs To Bovey Castle In The Immediate Vicinity. We Were Forced To Get Out Of The Car In North Bovey And Find Someone Who Could Direct Us. ,,,,,
,5061,All The Staff Were First Class And Very Professional.,,,,,
,5067,Useful Suggestions When Booking Our Accommodation Which We Took And It All Worked.,,,,,
,5068,There Was No Available Parking Spaces So We Had To Carry Our Luggage From The Overflow Car Park  Bit Of A Nightmare In My Heels!,,,,,
,5069,Everyone Very Helpful  Friendly,,,,,
,5071,We Arrived At Approx 12.40 With The Wedding Due To Start At 1Pm.  My Jacket Was In The Back Of The Car Which Was Parked For Us But We Could Not Locate The Keys  So I Went All Day Without My Jacket And It Was A While Before It Was Taken To Our Room.,,,,,
,5074,Nope,,,,,
,5079,I Had A Few Questions After Check-In Around Timings Etc. I Think Because We Arrived In The Middle Of A Power Cut And Staff We're Trying To Manage Both Arrivals  A Wedding Reception  And The Need For Candles Etc  A Couple Of Things Got Missed Off The Check-In Process. I Could Get All The Info From The Reception So No Problem Once I Had Been Down To Ask And Staff Response To Any And All Question/Request During Our Stay Was Professional And Friendly.,,,,,
,5083,We Were Very Impressed With The Pre Arrival Information Sent To Us And The Follow Up Phone Call.,,,,,
,5090,We Were Not Asked If We Would Like A Newspaper In The Mornings But Assume Other Rooms Were Able To Order One As They Had Them On Their Doors (I Believe). Staff Very Helpful With Our Luggage.,,,,,
,5104,Getting To Bovey Castle We Got Lost And Ended Up At North Bovey Where No-One Seemed To Know The Exact Route For Us Getting To You  Which Resulted In Our Going Around The Lanes For 40 Minutes.  This In An Aston Martin Is Not An Experience Either Of Us Would Wish To Repeat!!  We Will Know How To Get To You Easily In Future But For Other New Guests I Strongly Recommend More Signage Is Provided.,,,,,
,5105,The Staff Could Not Have Done More For Us - They Were Extremely Attentive And Concerned That We Should Have An Enjoyable Stay At The Hotel,,,,,
,5106,Pre Arrival Contact Was Superb.,,,,,
,5112,Fantastic Service As We Were Contacted Prior To Arrival And Organised Spa Reservations. Our Shopping Arrived Before We Did And This Was All Put Away For Us By The Time We Arrived. Thank You!,,,,,
,5115,Always Courteous And Friendly Staff On Arrival And Check In And Being Shown Around The Room Federico There On Arrival Lovely Warm Welcome Thank You!,,,,,
,5118,Excellent Phone Staff ,,,,,
,5120,It Was Not Easy Making The Reservation To Stay As Your Booking Phone Number Was Either Engaged Or Not Answering.  I Got Through To The Main Reception Who Then Put Me Through To The Booking Desk  And After 3 Attempts  And Leaving Messages  I Was Then Told The Lady On The Booking Desk Had Gone Home.  I Was Told I Would Either Have To Book Online  Which I Was Told Wasn't 100% Confirmed  Or Call Back In The Morning.  This Was An Unsatisfactory Process.,,,,,
,5123,No Pre-Event Information Was Received Or Phone Call To Confirm Any Specific Requirements (We Were Told This Would Happen In Early December). Had To Chase Via 2 Phone Calls & Email Regarding Package Details  The Day Before Arrival. Asked For A Copy Of The Itinerary On Arrival At The Hotel  Was Told It Was In Our Room But Wasn't  Had To Ask A Different Receptionist Who Did Sort.,,,,,
,5124,I Can't See Any Way It Could Be Improved. We Especially Like The Arrival And I Particularly Like The Fact I Don't Have To Empty The Car,,,,,
,5126,Arrival Was Handled Well  Aside From The Aforementioned Parking Difficulty.  Regarding Staff Friendliness/Efficiency  We Did Experience One Issue - We Booked Afternoon Tea And Had Found The Sofa In Front Of The Fire In The Oak Bar To Be Free  So Settled There. We Were Then Told That We Had A Table Booked In The Library And That We Had To Go There Instead. It Took A Bit Of Persuasion But The Member Of Staff Eventually Relented And Agreed To Serve Tea Where We Were Already Seated - I Don't Understand Why It Was A Problem As We Saw Many Other People Being Served Tea In The Oak Bar Too? She Was Quite Grudging About It And I Felt Like We'd Been Making A Fuss  Which Detracted From The Experience.,,,,,
,5127,V Good,,,,,
,5129,Pre Booking Of Tea And Evening Meal Did Not Register But Was Not A Problem When We Arrived. In A Busy Period This Might Have Been A Problem.,,,,,
,5131,It Was Much Appreciated That We Were Given An Upgrade As It Was Our Anniversary  And Wished Happy Anniversary On Arrival. ,,,,,
,5135,Always A 5* Welcome  But Then So So Dependant On How Busy You Are  Or Which Staff Are On? Could Be 5* Or 2* Sometimes Getting A Seat At The Bar Is A Nightmare  Surely A Good Morning Or A Good Night When You Pass Reception Is Not To Difficult  Or Even A Smile? ( 3 Staff Peering At Computer As We Waft Invisibly Bye Is Not What We Expect. If You Manage To Engage With A Staff Member They Are Invariably Great  Just Fed Up With Having To Do All The Work Get That Engagement. ,,,,,
,5137,Very Welcoming And Attentive,,,,,
,5140,Pre Contact Very Good  Arrival Bit Poor  But The Whole Stay Made Up For That.,,,,,
,5141,Staff Was Efficient And Polite. ,,,,,
,5143,Was Perfect,,,,,
,5148,Can't Understand Why We Haven't Been Before ,,,,,
,5151,Donna  At Bookings Is Excellent.  Arrival Staff Seemed A Bit Disorganised This Year But Nothing Too Bad,,,,,
,5152,No All Dealt With Proffesionaly,,,,,
,5155,Wasn't Informed Water Was Green To Bath In. Was Told This Is Normal For This Time Of Year. Should Of Been Warned As This Is Unacceptable.,,,,,
,5157,Appreciated The Car Parking Facility By Staff As It Was Raining  The Same When We Were Leaving.,,,,,
,5161,Excellent And Very Helpful Staff,,,,,
,5162,Excellent ,,,,,
,5165,The Hotel Were Great In Calling Me More Than Once To Ask If We Required Anything Before Our Arrival. ,,,,,
,5166,Very Helpful In Organising Things In Advance Of Our Arrival - Spa Treatments  Room Rates And Deal Etc.,,,,,
,5167,Surprised To Get A Phone Call On The Day Before Arrival  To See If The Staff Could Assist With Any Other Arrangements/Activities. This Was Well Received  Your Staff Striving To Provide Excellent Service.,,,,,
,5168,The Bottle Of Champagne And Card To Celebrate Our Wedding Anniversary Was A Very Welcome Surprise  Thank You!,,,,,
,5169,Excellent,,,,,
,5175,Reception Was Busy But All The Staff Were Very Helpful.,,,,,
,5176,A Member Of The Team Took The Time And Trouble To Give Us A Tour Of The Hotel And Showed Us The Main Reception Rooms.,,,,,
,5177,It Would Be Better If It Could Be Made Clear That Your Car Will Be Taken From You In Order To Allow All Baggage (And Dogs) Are Removed Prior To The Car Being Taken.,,,,,
,5180,Excellent ...Gracie Was Lovely...,,,,,
,5181,Excellent Service On Arrival,,,,,
,5185,Just Excellent!,,,,,
,5188,Adam In Resort Service S Was Very Efficient Prior To Arrival In Booking Our Special Requirements. ,,,,,
,5191,All Went Very Smoothly. Felt Welcome.,,,,,
,5193,The Staff Were Very Good And Amenable To Our Every Need. I Was Very Happy With All Their Attention To Me Having A Pleasant Stay.,,,,,
,5199,It Was Very Good,,,,,
,5203,Very Warmly Welcolmed By Orswin And Checked In Quickly. All Paperwork Done Very Quickly,,,,,
,5205,Very Helpful On The Phone When Making Arrangements.  The Request For Non-Feather Pillows Made It To Housekeeping - So Often Ignored.  Mentioning We'd Like To Plan Tennis Resulted In Us Being Asked Numerous Occasions To See If We'd Got The Tennis Balls.  Fabulous Attention To Detail. ,,,,,
,5207,Was Pleased When I Made The Reservation And Mentioned That It Was A Travelzoo (Ie Half Price Deal) I Was Still Treated In A Most Professional And Courteous Manner. I Have Known Otherwise In Other Places.,,,,,
,5208,Staff Were On Hand As Soon As We Arrived  And Even Opened The Car Door! ,,,,,
,5210,We Were Contacted The Day Before To See If There Was Any Thing We Needed And To Say That The Hotel Was Very Busy And We Could Only Eat At 6.30 Or 9Pm Neither Of Which Were Acceptable.. But When We Arrived We Were Given 8Pm That Suited Us Better.,,,,,
,5211,We Were Not Met On Arrival And So 'Told Off' Our Car Was A Hazard By The Door When She Did Arrive After Check In.. I Do Wonder If We Were Treated Differently Because We Were On A Special Winter Warmer Deal - Ie Paying Less Than Normal.,,,,,
,5212,Very Welcoming  And Very Easy Process.,,,,,
,5213,Message Before Arrival And Whole Process Was Very Good. ,,,,,
,5214,Impressed That We Received A Phone Call The Day Before To Check What Time We Would Like To Dine.   ,,,,,
,5219,No,,,,,
,5224,We Were Debating Whether Or Not To Bring Our Dog And Knew You Were Dog-Friendly. However Previously We Stayed In A Dog-Friendly Hotel Where We Were Stuck In A Room Which Felt And Smelled Like A Kennel! The Details In Your Info Book In The Room Gave Much More Of A Feel Of How Dogs Are Definitely Welcome  And I Don't Recall Seeing All That On Your Website - Might Be An Idea To Add?  I Also Read The Service Charge Details With Great Interest And Enjoyed Learning More About Your Staff Development And Charitable Support - Again  I Would Have Welcomed The Opportunity To Read All Of That Prior To Arrival.  Whole Arrival Efficient And Pleasant  From Valet Parking To Escorted To The Bedroom And Offered A Tour Of Hotel.,,,,,
,5225,Very Efficient Check In And Luggage Brought Directly To The Room,,,,,
,5227,N/A,,,,,
,5232,All Good,,,,,
,5234, I Had A Call The Day Before To See If We Needed Anything And On Arrival Staff Made It Very Easy For Us.,,,,,
,5235,Felt Very Special From The Moment I Opened My Car Door.,,,,,
,5237,Lauren Greeted Us  Gave Us A Quick Tour Of The Hotel Before Our Treatments  Made Us Feel Very Welcome.....We Also Had A Pre Contact Message Left By Ella....That Was Very Thoughtful.,,,,,
,5239,Unfaultable,,,,,
,5242,Just Perfect,,,,,
,5243,Mess Up With The Room  Dissapointing  Put In A Room With No Bath  Despite A Request Off A Bath,,,,,
,5244,We Were Very Impressed To Receive The Courtesy Call From Ellie A Couple Of Days Before Our Arrival.,,,,,
,5245,Phone Call Ahead Of Arrival Was A Nice Touch And Helpful. ,,,,,
,5248,It Was A Delightful Surprise To Be Met By The Manager  Federico  A First!,,,,,
,5249,The Phone Call Prior To Arrival Was A Nice Touch. ,,,,,
,5250,Loved The Staff Uniform!!,,,,,
,5259,I Appreciated The Call To Confirm Dinner Plans.,,,,,
,5267,Donna The Reservation Agent Was Extremely Thorough.,,,,,
,5269,Very Good,,,,,
,5280,So Much Better Than The Last Time We Stayed,,,,,
,5281,Staff Were Nice And Helpful On Arrival  But I Didn't Know That All Tables Would Be Booked For Tea / Lunch So It Was Difficult To Get A Seat And Some Of My Guests Got Upset.,,,,,
,5289,Prior To Arrival I Was Called Re Dinner Reservations To Check On Times  I Asked If I Could Change By 30 Minutes  "Told This Was Not Possible As The Restaurant Was Fully Booked". The Restaurant Was Only 40% Occupied Throughout - Why Was I Given Inaccurate Information. "No Marks For Customer Experience"!,,,,,
,5290,No Very Pleased Overall,,,,,
,5297,Everyone Was Very Friendly & Made Us Feel Welcome.,,,,,
,5298,We Got A Call Asking Whether We Wished Ot Book Anyhting Before Arrival - Might Have Been A Good Idea To Tell Us What Was On!,,,,,
,5299,I Was Unhappy With The Room Allocated And Wished To See An Alternative Based On The Tarif I Was Paying And Also A Room For Which I Could Pay An Upgrade. The Member Of Staff Left Us To Go Back To Reception To Arrange This And Did Not Return. After10minutes I Went Down To Reception To See Him Carrying In Another Visitor's Bags. Reception Said It Would Be 45 Mins Before Another Room At The Same Tariff Would Be Available So I Agreed To Pay A £40Upgrade As It Was3.15 Pm And We Were Due To Be In Newton Abbot At 4Pm. As There Were Only About 8 Rooms Occupied On Sunday Evening I Was Surprised They Did Not Have More Rooms Ready.,,,,,
,5301,Perhaps A Little Speedier. We Were 2 Of Only A Few Guests And Possibly There Was A Low Ratio Of Staffing On Arrival - They Were Efficient And Friendly Though.,,,,,
,5303,All The Staff At The Entrance And Reception Were Most Welcoming And Put Us At Our Ease Immediately With Their Efficiency.,,,,,
,5305,Perfect - Very Welcoming.,,,,,
,5307,It Would Have Been Nice If The Reception Staff Offered Help With Unloading The Car At The Lodge Because Of The Location Of Our Lodge We Couldn't Get The Car That Close. The Directions To The Lodge Were Misleading And The Signage For The Lodges Isn't Obvious. The Lodge Car Park Was Unusable When We Stayed Due To The Rain.,,,,,
,5316,The Hotle Tour Was Excellent To Get To Know The Place Without Having To Ask Directions ,,,,,
,5317,I Received A Call Before Arrival  - Which Was Very Helpful For Booking A Table For Lunch And Spa Treatments ! Our Room Was Available Early - So Made Check In Very Easy . ,,,,,
,5318,It Was Brilliant To Have Our Car Cleaned On Arrival.  That Is A Fantastic Service.  We Asked If Our Range Rover Could Be Cleaned As We Arrived Because We Had Driven Through Lots Of Large Muddy Puddles And The Answer Was An Immediate "Yes" Without Hesitation ,,,,,
,5319,Ditto ,,,,,
,5322,The Staff Seemed Willing  Helpful And Very Kind But I Think They Don't Have The Right Training. 
We Arrived Many People Together (Group) So At Some Points I Didn't Feel The Tailor-Made Attention 
I Have Been Treated As Part Of A Group And Not As A Special Individual  My Friend Who Did The Group Booking Had A More Special Treatment. ,,,,,
,5323,Dinner Was Booked Both Nights For Us In The Bistro At 6Pm.  I Was Able To Change One Night To The Edwardian But We Had To Eat At 6.30Pm Which Was A Tad Early For Us.  Would Have Been Nice To Have Been Given A Choice Of Restaurant And A Decent Timeslot,,,,,
,5324,On Arrival  Concierge Came To The Car And Opened The Door But Had No Umbrella With Them And One Had To Be Asked For By A Colleague.  It Was Sheet Rain On Arrival.  Umbrellas Were In Short Reply Throughout The Stay Despite Having To Walk Across To The Conference Room.  Otherwise  Very Attentive Concierge And Always Available And Engaging.,,,,,
,5326,The Manager Intrduced Himself A Said He Would Send Mark Down To Show Us How To Re Set The Trips   But He Didn't. ,,,,,
,5327,Upon Arrival The Ranger At The Door Was Extermly Welcoming - His First Words Were "Welcome To Bovey Castle" - I Can Not Stress How Nice That Was - I Have Stayed At Many Fine Hotels And With The Exception Of Raffells Hotel In Singapore - I Do Not Think I Have Experienced Such A Geniune Welcome And Helpfulness To Unload And Park My Car. It Sounds Silly But It Is An Imposing Drive And Driving Round To The Front And Being Waved Into To Stop At The Front Door And Such A Warm Welcome Really Went Along Way  ,,,,,
,5328,Minor Point - Confusion Re Where To Park If You One Is Residing In The Estate Lodges. ,,,,,
,5329,Very Professional And Efficient.,,,,,
,5330,Good Greeting And Welcome.,,,,,
,5333,We Were Especially Impressed With The Staff Given The Snow When We Arrived!,,,,,
,5334,Warm  Personalised & Welcoming ,,,,,
,5337,I Did Like The Pre Stay Phone Call Asking If There Was Anything I Needed  I Didn't Even Get That Service At The Ritz,,,,,
,5338,Very Happy With All Aspects. ,,,,,
,5342,Excellent Service And Very Helpful. We Were  Late Due To The Flooding But This Wasn't A Problem. We Missed Our Slot At The Restaurant But Room Service Was Suggested - A Great Alternative As We Were Very Tired.,,,,,
,5344,No,,,,,
,5345,We Were Greeted By Charming And Efficient Staff. ,,,,,
,5350,No It Was Perfect And The Call Before We Arrived To Check To See If We Needed Anything Was A Nice Touch!,,,,,
,5352,No,,,,,
,5353,A Welcome & Unexpected Complimentary Glass Of Champagne On Arrival To Mark Our 30Th Wedding Anniversary.,,,,,
,5354,Great Valet Service And Tour. ,,,,,
,5355,We Didn't Know That The Staff Would Park Our Car When We Arrived  But Were Pleasantly Surprised To Find That They Did.,,,,,
,5356,No It Was All Perfect,,,,,
,5358,Only As Aforementioned,,,,,
,5361,Perfect And The Staff Remembered Us Which I Have To Say Is The Best Kind Of  Service. ,,,,,
,5362,Staff Very Helpful In Making Restaurant Reservations. ,,,,,
,5363, We Were Unable To Get Through The Floods From The A38 And On Telephoning Staff Redirected Us,,,,,
,5364,Very Helpful With Telephone Reservation Enquiry - Made Me Feel Welcome,,,,,
,5365,No,,,,,
,5366,Waited For Bags To Arrive In Room For 20 Mins,,,,,
,5369,Very Attentive To Call Before Stay And Enquiring After Additional Needs. Great That The Dog Could Come And Was Well Looked After With All The Facilities On Site. ,,,,,
,5371,No,,,,,
,5372,Our Car Had Been Caught In The Bad Weather Which Meant It Wouldn't Drive The Last 2 Miles. Ella Was Our Knight In Shining Armour And Cam Recused Us - Fab Little Driver Too! ,,,,,
,5373,Very Attentive Staff. Very Welcoming Man Who Offered Valet Parking. ,,,,,
,5378,The Bovey Castle Team Kindly Informed Me About Dinner Reservation Ahead Of My Arrival  Which Was Very Helpful. ,,,,,
,5382,Some Places Allow Check In In The Room For Guests Who Book Rooms Like The Grand Suite. ,,,,,
,5383,Bit Of An Irritating Arrival In That We Were Asked To Park And Wait In The Car Then Other Rather Pushed Guests Drove In Front Of Us And Were Allowed To Unload Before Us - Poor Jake Had Trouble Policing The Arrivals Esp In The Rain.. Just Left Feeling A Bit Irritated For A Few Minutes.. ,,,,,
,5386,Had To Check A Few Times Whether The Room Was Ready - No One Came To Tell Us. Tour Was Good.,,,,,
,5387,We Arrived Early And Were Made To Feel Most Welcome.,,,,,
,5388,We Arrived Early And As The Official Check In Was 3.0 P.M. We Went For Lunch Expecting The Room To Be Ready When We Returned.
It Wasn't Ready Until Reception Made A Call. We Felt On Seeing Our Room (40) That The Bathroom Hadn't Received The Attention It Should Have Had.
,,,,,
,5391,We Nearly Didnt Book Actually As We Had A Voucher Which We Bought At A Charity Auction.  I Initially Rang And Asked If The Value Of It Could Be Deducted From The 3 For 2 Half Term Offer So We Could Bring Our Children (Voucher Just For Two).  I Was Told The Voucher Would Have To Be Used On A Seperate Visit.  A Week Or So Later I Thought I Would Ring And Check Again About This And Emma Who I Spoke To On This Occasion Checked With The Manager And That It Was Ok To Do So.  I Was So Glad I Rang Again To Make Sure.,,,,,
,5392,None,,,,,
,5395,As Above,,,,,
,5396,The One Member Of Staff I Would Like To Recognise Was A Gentleman ( I Don't Have His Name ) Who Ensured The Fire Was Going In The Main Room In The Evening Where We Sat After Our Meal . ( The Food In The Edwardian Was Excellent By The Way. ) As For Arrival I Feel Repeat Customers Should Be Acknowledged ( Even When I Said We Got Married There The Response Should Have Been 'Welcome Back'  Instead ....... Nothing ). Our Bags Were Taken To The Room   Again A Nice Touch. Also Federico As We Were Leaving Asked Twice If We Would Like The Car Brought Up   We Were Fine But Its Nice To Be Asked.,,,,,
,5397,Frederico And Richard (Golf Pro) Remembered Us From Our Last Visit We Were Very Touched,,,,,
,5404,It Seemed Hard To Contact Reservations Prior To Coming - For Making And Changing Reservation Details.  Contact Also With The Spa Facilities Was Difficult.  We Left Messages On Both Voice Mails (Reservations And Spa) And Call Backs Were Not Forthcoming.,,,,,
,5406,Really Helpful Directions To Avoid Floods! ,,,,,
,5407,We Didn't Find Staff Particularly Welcoming...It Was Ok,,,,,
,5408,The Doormen Were Brilliant. The Guest Services Were Excellent. Service In The Lodges Was Outstanding Very Very Flexible. Reception Staff Were Fine But Not As Dynamic / Charming As The Rest Of The Team.,,,,,
,5415,We Were Made Very Welcome On Arrival And The Resort Team Were Also Wonderful At Keeping In Touch With Me And Making All Our Arrangements Prior To Arrival. We Did Have To Call A Couple Of Times For Our Luggage To Be Brought Up  But This Was The Only Thing We Had To Ask For During Our Stay.,,,,,
,5416,No,,,,,
,5417,Special Thanks To Felicity On Reception For Her Usual Friendly Greeting  And A Special Thanks To Derrick For Keeping An Eye On Our Car Being Parked Overnight.,,,,,
,5419,Excellent,,,,,
,5420,See Previous Comments - All There.,,,,,
,5421,Once Again Lauren Was Fantastic  She Went Above And Beyond To Make Our Stay Fantastic,,,,,
,5424,Very Pleasant Lady Rang The Evening Before To Check Our Booking And Reserve A Table,,,,,
,5425,The 24 Hour Courtesy Call Before Hand Was A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,5430,Flooded Roads Had Made The Journey Difficult - On Arrival We Were Sent Complimentary Champagne To Our Room. A Very Nice Gesture.  ,,,,,
,5431,We Were Very Well Looked After On Our Arrival - Our Bags Were Taken To Our Room And The Car Was Parked - It Was Very Smooth.,,,,,
,5433,I Thought That The Staff Were Extremely Professional  Polite And Friendly. Bovey Castle Is An Amazing Place  But The Staff Make It Even More Special. We Felt There Like At Home And At Ease.,,,,,
,5434,Very Easy And Helpful In Make Pre Bookings For Archery And Gin And Cider Making Sessions,,,,,

10,Do You Have Any Other Comments Regarding Your Bedroom/Suite?,,,,,,
,Total Responses:,2386,,,,,
,Not Answered:,0,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,
,1,Iron & Ironing Board Would Be Useful Addition To Room Items Vs Ordering From Housekeeping  Mattress Very Soft (Possibly Needs Changing)  Too Much So For My Back.,,,,,
,4,The Bed Was So Comfortable.  The Room Was Slightly Too Hot But Better Than Being Too Cold!  It Was Lovely Having A Little Hall Which Seperated The Bedroom And Bathroom.  The Shower Was Perfect Too.,,,,,
,7,We Stayed In A Lodge And My Husband And I Had A Bed Made Up From Two Single Beds Pushed Together. This Was Uncomfortable  But Due To The Other Members In The Party  This Was Unavoidable.,,,,,
,9,It Was Perfect  Thank You :),,,,,
,10,While The Room Was Very Good There Were A Few Areas Of Damage. Some Stains On Chairs. Serious Damp Problem And Stains In The Bathroom. Room Number 35.,,,,,
,12,I Was Happy With The Bedroom We Ended Up With But We Had To Ask To Change Because Our First Room Had Obviously Been Smoked In Previously  Which Was Pretty Disappointing Partic Bearing In Mind We Had Our Baby Son Staying Which The Hotel Was Aware Of.,,,,,
,13,More Electric Sockets Were Needed; It Was Lamp Or Kettle. Drink Making Facilities Need A Designated Surface - Not A Highly Polished Antique Chest.  A Tray  Perhaps?,,,,,
,14,Some Glasses And Dishes Dirty.  Furniture And Lights Needed Dusting.  Rugs Dirty.  Kitchen Floor Dirty With Mud.,,,,,
,15,We Were Upgraded To The Next Level Room. The Room We Had Booked Was Â£390 Per Night. Without The Upgrade We Would Have Found The Room Very Small For The Price When Compared To Other Similar Hotels,,,,,
,17,The Door To Room 4 Had Damage Around Lock/Handle Area And No Inside Door Lock Though Room Safe Very Good,,,,,
,22,Room 18 Thank You For The Upgrade Great Room With A View Only One Complaint The Central Heating Was Set To Low.,,,,,
,24,Cell Phone Use Was Very Difficult In Whole Area. There Are Pros And Cons Concerning Cell Phone Use. But I Think Today  It Is Such An Important Tool To Use.,,,,,
,25,The Main Door To The Bedroom Was Not Great And The Only Way To Close It Was To Slam The Door.  This Was Fine During The Day But At Night It Obviously Became A Problem As Slamming Doors Kept Waking Me Up.,,,,,
,27,Why Are There No Clocks In Any Of The Rooms In The Lodges?  One In The Kitchen Would Have Been Very Useful.  I Have To Say My Bed Was A Little Soft And Made My Back Ache In The Morning.,,,,,
,28,Thee Were Some Issues On Arrival That Were Immediately Resolved By Your Staff,,,,,
,29,The Room Was Wonderful - We Upgraded To Junior State Room,,,,,
,30,Excellent,,,,,
,32,Wifi Should Be Free It Is Just Apart Of Life These Days Not Really A 'Luxury',,,,,
,33,Loved The Location. 2Nd Floor Overlooking The Beautiful Countryside,,,,,
,36,Overlooked The Car Park So Initially Had Concerns Re Potential Noise But It Was Fine - Would Have Preferred A Scenic View!,,,,,
,39,The Room Initially Smelt Of Dogs...?,,,,,
,42,Room 14 Is Cold  Very Cold. I Will Ask Not To Stay In There Again.,,,,,
,44,Although The Room Was Very Clean  There Is Inevitably Wear Every Where. Cushions On The Bed Are Torn  Stain On The Blanket Etc. Sorry To Be Picky But I Ran A 5Star Gold Guest House Of My Own With The Highest Standard In The Country.,,,,,
,45,We Stayed In Room 2 Which Was Beautiful Inside But The Room Did Get Very Hot At Night. Had To Get Up To Open The Window.,,,,,
,47,We Stayed In A Lodge,,,,,
,48,My Husband Had Booked Us A One Night Stay In A Valley Castle Room And Later We Booked For Two Nights But Chose A Cheaper Room - Castle Room.  We Were Delighted And Grateful That On Check In You Had Very Kindly Upgraded Us To The Valley Room For Two Nights.  I Was Slightly Dissapointed Though With The Size Of The Room But Appreciate That The Valley Room Is More Expensive As To The View From The Window  Albeit The Windows Were Rather Small!  We Appreicate That It Is An Old Building But I Did Rather Expect A Better Shower In Room 34.  For A 5* Hotel And For The Price  I Expected A Bit Better!,,,,,
,49,Very Nice Room,,,,,
,50,The Milk In The Fridge Had Gone Off. Only Realised When We Tried To Make Tea.,,,,,
,55,Difference Between Castle Room/ Junior Suite Was Negligible. Probably Not Worth The Difference.,,,,,
,57,No Mirror Provided Above The Dressing Table.  Not Enough Storage Space For A 3 Night Visit.,,,,,
,58,Mold Was Seen In The Bathroom Around Bath And Windows  Light Bulb Was Out Above Desk  Top Blanket Had A Stain On It.  These Are Minor Point And Did Not Detract From The Overall Wonderful Experiences.,,,,,
,61,I Think Paying For Internet Access Was A Bit Unnecessary.,,,,,
,62,It Was A Bit Cold.,,,,,
,63,Stayed In Hound Lodge,,,,,
,64,We Had A Problem With The Television In Our Bedroom. This Was Dealt With Efficiently And Promptly By The Staff; We Were Impressed.,,,,,
,68,Shower Screen Had To Be Angled Inside The Bath To Prevent Water From Pooling On The Floor Outside Of The The Bathtub.  The Reason Why Is Because There Was A Gap Between The Rubber Seal On The Screen And The Bath Edge.,,,,,
,69,The 2 Fire Doors Killed The Feeling Of Space - Much Better Once We Jammed Them Open,,,,,
,70,Issue Of Noise Due To Maintenance  In Next Door Vacant Lodge For 5 Days  Manager Has Proposed Compensation Which I Am Waiting For In Writing  With The Issue Being Dealt With Professionally And Efficiently By The Manager,,,,,
,73,Lovely Room (24) And Generally Very Clean But There Were A Few Spots On The Standard Lamp Shade Which Looked Like Blood And Really We Would Not Expect To See That In A 5 Star Hotel/Room,,,,,
,75,Lighting In Bathroom Was Very Dim (Bedroom 10).  Water Pressure In Shower Was Very Poor.,,,,,
,77,I Was A Little Disapointed With The Size Of Our Room  We Had Room 30 For Us And 33 For The Children And We Thought Room 30 Was Very Small.  I Was Expecting It To Be A Bit More Luxurious And Certainly Bigger For The Price We Were Paying.  However  I Am Aware Now That This Is The Smallest Category Of Room Size Now And Even Though The Room Was Fine And Very Comfortable  I Would Stay In A Bigger Room Next Time I Booked.,,,,,
,78,We Were In Kitty Jay And The Bed Was Too Soft.,,,,,
,79,No,,,,,
,81,We Spoke With The Manager - Federico - About Our Problems  And He Was Very Kind And Listened To Everything We Had To Say.,,,,,
,83,Pillows Not Great And Free Wifi Would Have Been Expected.,,,,,
,89,Get Rid Of The Silly Wardrobes . They Look Nice And Are No Good For Anything More Than Shirts Or Jackets. Normal Dress Length Make Them Unusable. Tv Cable System Not Very User Friendly. Perennial Hair Dryer Problem In Hotels. Plug But No Mirror / Dressing Table .,,,,,
,90,Some Difficulty Tuning Television Set,,,,,
,92,Large Size Slippers Would Be Appreciated (Size 11 Feet Are Far Too Big For The Slippers Provided),,,,,
,93,The First Room We Were Shown To Had A Number Of Problems.  A Common Problem Appears To Be The Length Of The Cable On The Kettle Being Too Short!,,,,,
,94,Could Of Done With A Fan In The Room Was Very Warm Even With Window Open,,,,,
,96,Some Wear And Tear Which Should Be Dealt With Superficial.  Better Range Of Beauty Products.,,,,,
,99,We Made A Few Comments On Our Departure.  The Handbook Has Wrong Swimming Times For Children On It.  It Would Be Great To Have A Copy Or Sample Menus Of The Restuarants In The Lodges.,,,,,
,100,No,,,,,
,102,The Television Was Difficult To Operate.,,,,,
,103,Very Dissapointed Unable To Access The Internet Without Having To Pay.  We Have Stayed At Many 5* Hotels/Retreats And All Of Them Apart From You Had Free Wifi Throughout The Hotel.  Mobile Reception Was Very Poor But Appreciate We Were On Dartmoor.,,,,,
,104,The Castle Bedroom Was Wonderful In Terms Of Decoration And Comfort. The Only Shortcoming Was That The Shower Really Could Not Be Used Because There Was No Water Pressure At All.,,,,,
,105,We Did Have A Problem With The Handle In The Shower  As I Turned The Shower On The Handle Dropped Off And Then Smashed The Porcelain Handle. It Was Loose And Had Obviously Happened Before As There Were Many Little Chips In The Shower Tray. I Did Report It To The Desk When We Checked Out And The Receptionist Apologized And Said She Would Report It To Maintenance.,,,,,
,107,Nothing To Note Of.,,,,,
,109,Difficulty In Finding A Power Point That Could Accommodate The Lead For The Kettle.  Lead Too Short / Power Point In Difficult Position,,,,,
,112,Bathroom Was A Little Basic In Terms Of Decor And Products Were Limited E.G. Shower Gel Etc...,,,,,
,115,We Were Very Happy With The Room That We Were Allocated,,,,,
,117,The Carpet Was A Little Stained And The Cork Bathrooms Feel A Bit Dated But  Overall  We Thought The Lodges Were Lovely. A Little More Attention To How They Are Equipped Would Not Go Amiss Though. We Only Had One Wine Glass And Had To Ring For These To Be Brought Down.,,,,,
,118,Room Good But Noise From The Exterior Ventilators Detracted From The Experience,,,,,
,119,Was Smaller Than Expected,,,,,
,120,The Only Disappointment   The Room Was To Small And No View .,,,,,
,121,Very Nice,,,,,
,123,The Room Was Far Too Stuffy. Even With The Fan It Was Unbearable. Could Not Wait To Go Outside For Fresh Air!,,,,,
,125,Interconnecting - Could Be Very Noisy,,,,,
,126,The Room Was A Little Too Warm At Night.,,,,,
,129,Disappointed That There Was No Shower In A Jnr Suite....,,,,,
,130,Any Minor Omissions Were Quickly Rectified,,,,,
,131,The Fridge Did Not Work So The Milk Left Inside Had Gone Off.  It Was Also Apparent That The Area Behind The Cabinet It Was In Had Not Been Dusted For Quite Some Time.  The Radiator In The Room Did Not Work So The Room Waa Quite Cold But In Fairness An Electric Heater Was Brought Promptly To The Room.  The Fridge Seemingly Only Needed A Fuse Changing But The Fact That It Was Not Working Should Have Been Picked Up And Rectified When The Room Wqas Cleaned/Checked.,,,,,
,133,Felt Like We Were In Servants Quarters Very Small,,,,,
,139,When The Shower Was On Full The The Wet Room Was Unable To Cope And Flooded. A Shelf Adjacent To The Wash Hand Basin Would Have Been More Convenient Than The Small Table A Metre Or So Away.,,,,,
,140,Although The Toilet Seat Had Recently Been Fitted  Unfortunately It Did Not Fit Properly And The Lid Would Not Stay Open When Toilet Was In Use. A New Lock Had Been Fitted To The Bedroom Door Which Did Not Look Finished And The Workmanship Was Shoddy. Although The Water  Tea/Coffee And Toiletries Were Continually Replenished  We Had To Ask On 2 Occasions To Have The Milk Replenished.,,,,,
,141,Our Bed Was Too Soft.,,,,,
,142,Hot Water System Needs Improvement And Shower Pressure Poor To Average.  Sink Plug Would Not Stay In Place.,,,,,
,150,Better Coffe Machine - Please,,,,,
,153,We Upgraded On Our Arrival Because Our First Room Window View Was Straight Onto A Roof Outside - Not Very Aesthetically Pleasing.  Our Upgrade Was A Bigger Room With A View To The Front Of The Castle  But To Be Honest I Wouldn't Pay No More Than We Did  And Infact On Closer Inspection We Found That One Of The Chairs Had A Broken Wheel  The Shelf In The Bathroom Was Broken And The Table In The Room Was Also Broken-Unable To Extend It  Felt The Room Wasn't Value For Money Despite The Special Offer On The Upgrade; The Room Was Also A Tad Dated And Could Be Overlooked From The Room Next Door. We Certainly Wouldn't Pay Full Rate For This Particular Room.,,,,,
,155,The First Bedroom Was Very Loud  The Second Was Quiet Except In The Moorning. At 6H There Was A Regular Noise For About 10 Minutes. The Bathroom Should Be Renovated And Cleaned.,,,,,
,156,Sofa And Armchair Were Very Uncomfortable In Rose Cottage  Everything Else Was Great.,,,,,
,157,Two Things In Room 58 Made It 8 Out Of 10 1. The Toilet Was Very Slow To Refill  And I Mean Very Slow. 2. The Sink Water Did Not Run Away Without Having To Remove The Plug  Little Things I Know.,,,,,
,161,Lodge Security Was Questionable.  The Bolts Didn't Fit  And The Doors Did Not Close Flush To The Walls. We Had Been Told There Would Be A Room Safe But There Wasn't One.,,,,,
,162,Window Catches Would Not Allow The Window To Be Fixed Open Due To Their Age. Nice Touch With The Bottled Water Being Replenished And Placed By The Bedside For The Night,,,,,
,163,Twin Basins Would Be Nice (And There Was Room To Accommodate!). Worth Noting Wi-Fi Is Free In Many Other 5 Star Hotels. Slightly Surprised The Bedroom Was On The Small Side For A Superior Castle Room (Though The Bathroom Was Very Spacious).,,,,,
,164,No Milk For Tea Making And Mini Fridge Could Have Had A Selection Of Wine/Spirits,,,,,
,165,The Television Did Not Work.  We Rang The Desk At 10:00 Pm And Again At 11:10 Pm.  The Window Blind Was Broken.,,,,,
,167,The Room Was A Little Dated But It Wasn't Too Important  As We Spent Most Of The Time Enjoying The Fantastic Grounds And Facilities,,,,,
,168,Carpet In The Lodge Was Quite Shabby/Nt Very Clean.    Carpet Flooring On Groud Floor Is Not Ideal As It Gets Dirtied Easily From Balcony Entrance.,,,,,
,170,Internet Access Was Sporadic  Which Was An Issue Given The Inherently Poor Phone Coverage.,,,,,
,175,The Fan Outside The Bedroom Window Was Very Loud,,,,,
,179,No Mirror On The Dressing Table Bathroom A Bit Old Fashioned The Shower Was Quite Under Powered.,,,,,
,180,Generally Very Good.  Here Are Some Constructive Comments: I Think The Location Of The Sofa And The Desk Should Be Switched -- Or  Electrical Outlets Put At Desk Height At The Side Of The Room Where The Desk Is Currently.  Switching The Location Would Make Watching Tv More Pleasant And Facilitate Use Of The Outlets For Charging Items (And Drying Hair). The Bathroom Door Needs To Have The Hinges Oiled.  What A Lot Of Noise!  Very Disturbing During The Night. You Should Install Individual Nespresso Machines In Each Room.  The Set-Up For Coffee Isn't Very Nice; Hard To Use And The Coffee Was Very Weak. You Should Have A Stocked Mini-Bar.  Why Not?  It's A Cash Cow -- Huge Markup. I Absolutely Detest The British Tendency To Have Separate Hot And Cold Taps For A Bathroom Sink.,,,,,
,181,The Room Was Ok But Had View Of Roof Tops So Was Disappointed.,,,,,
,182,The Bedroom Was A Good Size But Some Of The Fittings Were Looking Tired. We Had A Real Problen With The Key To Our Door. It Was Very Difficult To Get The Door To Lock And We Nearly Gave Up On One Occaision !! Clearly From The Marks On The Door We Were Not The First Guests To Have These Problems!!,,,,,
,183,Although Generally Everything Was Clean  The Covering Of The Bathroom Floor Showed That The Corners  Especially At End Of The Bath Hadn't Been Dusted For Quite A While!,,,,,
,184,Mobile Phone Network Functioning In The Rooms Only Would Be Recommended,,,,,
,185,Clearer Information Concerning Availability Of Free Wifi Connection Required,,,,,
,186,The Carpets In Room 13 Have Seen Better Days.   The Carpet In The Bathroom Is Not Acceptable Due To Water Stains Particularly Around The Lavatory Bowel.,,,,,
,188,Room 9 - Nothing Special And Too Warm To Be Comfortable - Tv Difficult To Understand - Needs Air Conditioning - Awful View. Feel Like Allotted As We Were On A Gift Voucher Offer.,,,,,
,190,Dirty Stain On Pillow In Room 5.,,,,,
,193,Please See Previous Comments About Separate Sleeping Area For Baby.,,,,,
,194,Surprised To Find Stains On The Carpet And The Door Handle To The Bathroom Came Off In My Hand Leaving Me Stuck Inside. Fortunately My Roommate Was Able To Get Me Out. I Would Have Thought These Kinds Of Things Would Be Addressed Before Letting The Room,,,,,
,195,On Arrival We Were Allocated Room 51.  The Bathroom Was Extremely Small  Had A Small Bath And Just An Overhead Low Shower Insufficient For A Tall Man.  This Room Was Very Disappointing And Below The Standard Which We Had Anticipated.  The Staff Responded To Our Concerns And Immediately Offered Two Alternative Rooms For Our Perusal.  We Accepted Room 58 And Were Happy.  We Were Very Pleased With The Professional Response From The Staff On Duty.,,,,,
,197,We Felt That The Bathroom Could Do With Updating Considering That We Were In One Of The Better Suites.,,,,,
,205,We Were Fortunate To Have Room 12 Which Gave Lovely Views To The Front Of The Hotel Entance.A Few Small Constructive Comments....There Wasnt Room For The Kettle On The Small Glass Table With The Other Lovely Box Of Refreshments And So We Had To Place It On The Floor Because Of The Short Cable? The Wicker Waste Paper Bin Didn't Have A Bin Liner So Wet Items Such As Tea Or Coffee Bags Would Have Made A Mess Of The Carpet Underneath Which Looked As If This Had Happened Previously From The Stains Underneath? So I Felt I Had To Find A Liner To Put In Ourselves. There Was A Large Draughty Gap In One Of The Lower Central Windows (But We Understand This Because We Live In An Edwardian House Ourselves) We Didnt Flush The Ensuite Toilet Late At Night Or Early In The Mornings Because It Sounded Like 'The Titanic' With Its Fog Horns On!! : )) This Made Us Smile  We Found Some Stray Hairs In Our Bedding.But Apart Fom Those Few Small Things We Totally Loved Our Room The Magazines And The Fluffy Towels Slippers And Robes We Felt Very Relaxed And At Home.,,,,,
,206,It Was Lovely  But Quite Cold.,,,,,
,210,Had To Move Rooms Because Of Noisy Kitchen Fan Outside Of The Window,,,,,
,213,We Made Our Feelings About The Room Clear To The Manager Prior To Leaving. It Was Very Noisey And Didnt Therefore Find The Stay Restful As We Were Awakened Very Early By Staff Outside The Room And Late In The Night. Not A Good Position For A Room. We Felt Second Rate As Not Part Of The Upstairs Residents.,,,,,
,214,It Was Very Cold. The Bathroom  In Particular  Was Freezing With No Source Of Heating At All. As A Result  Towels And Swimming Costumes Did Not Dry.  The Internet (At Least On Iphones And Ipads) Required An Overly Long Login On Each Occasion.,,,,,
,215,Free Wifi Would Be Useful,,,,,
,219,There Were A Few Ceiling Cobwebs Which Did Surprise Me :(,,,,,
,220,Stayed In A Lodge. The Carpet In The Lounge Was In Need Of A Good Clean. There Could Have Been A Few More Glasses - And I Missed Having Champagne Glasses.,,,,,
,224,We Stayed In Room 1 And It Was Very Hot Even With Hearing Turned Off.,,,,,
,226,We Loved The Bedroom But Was Slightly Disappointed With The Bathroom - It Was Fine And Clean Just Not To The Same Finishing As Everything Else In The Hotel.,,,,,
,227,Wasn't Clear If There Was Any Level Of 'Free Wi Fi'. We Were Unable To Log On Anyway.,,,,,
,228,Would Have Liked A Bath Especially As We Have A Baby. Would Have Been Prepared To Upgrade Had We Known We Would Have Not Had A Bath. Found This Confusing As You Advertise As Being Family Friendly!,,,,,
,229,Everything Was Absolutely Perfect Except That I Believe The Bed Balance Needs Changing As It Looked Soiled/Damp Along The Edges  The Minibar Fridge Had Old Milk And It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Fully Stocked Snacks/Drinks In The Room,,,,,
,230,The Bed Although Was Comfortable Was Very Soft And Gave Me A Bad Back,,,,,
,231,Great Selection Of Teas In The Room,,,,,
,234,The Room Was Excellent. The Only Problem Was The Shower Screen  Which Didn't Do A Very Good Job Of Keeping The Water Inside The Bath. Other Than That Everything Was Fantastic.,,,,,
,235,When Booking I Was Advised That We Would Have Both Twin Rooms On The Reception Floor. Dis Appointed That Our Rooms Were So Far Apart & That I (The Person That Booked) Had The Smaller Room. I Would Have Thought That You Would Have Put The Person That Was Booking In The Better/Bigger Room.,,,,,
,238,Exceeded Expectations,,,,,
,239,Having Stayed In Other 5 Star Hotels The Toiletries Were A Bit Limited And The Fact That Only Basic Internet Access For One Device Is Included In The Room Price Is Outdated.  At The Very Least Basic Access Should Be Available To All.,,,,,
,240,Did Not Use The Internet.,,,,,
,241,All Good,,,,,
,242,We Felt It Was A Little 'Tired' - For Example Lampshades Were Tatty,,,,,
,243,I Feel Strongly That Wifi Should Be Free In A 5 Star Hotel. It Seems Completely Out Of Character With The Rest Of The Hotel  Which Provides A High Level Of Hospitality,,,,,
,244,Have Already Detailed In Email  Cracked Wall Socket Face  Cracked Wash Hand Basin  Curled Rug (Trip Hazzard)  Tatty  Ripped Lampshade On Desk  No Security Box In Room  Chilly In The Evenings  Very Noisy Both From Reception Outside And Corridor Inside. Fantastic Bed And Fresh Milk And Fridge Appreciated.,,,,,
,245,Couldn't Get Online At First In The Conference Centre But Was Fine In The Room,,,,,
,247,Would Expect Free Wifi,,,,,
,248,Very Happy With Our Upgrade. Completely Made Our Trip To Have A Lovely View Of The Hillside,,,,,
,249,No,,,,,
,250,A Lovely Room,,,,,
,255,As Our Vouchers Only Allowed Us A Classic Room  When First Entering The Room  I Thought It A Little Small. But When I Saw The Bathroom  Which Was The Same Size  I Was Over The Moon. Being On The Top Floor Towards The End Of The Corridor Mean't It Was Nice And Quiet. The Room Was Lovely And Had Everything We Needed. Itwas A Shame There Wasn't A Small Fridge To Keep The Water Nice And Chilled  So We Asked For An Ice Bucket...So Not A Problem At All. The Decor Was Modern  Relaxing And Clean (Not Too Old Fashioned Or Flowery). Not Much Of A View  But It Was Ok. The Bed Was Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,256,Fridge Was Very Loud And Tv Did Not Work.,,,,,
,257,It Was Lovely - Very Fitting Of The Castle.   The Television Repeatedly Had Issues  Would Not Change Channels  Frize Etc.  On The One Ocassion We Placed A Service Call Assistance Was Prompt And Resolved The Issue.,,,,,
,259,Internet Commection Was Patchy To Say The Least.   Lighting Is A Little Dim If You Wish To Work. As A Female Who Would Like To Sit At The Dressing Table To Blow Dry Her Or Put On Make Up For An Evening Out - The Mirror On The Wall Is Way To High To Do This.  Even At 5 Ft 7 I Had To Stand Rather Than Sit To See Reflection And Resorted To The Bathroom For Light And Mirrors To Apply Make Up. What Happened To The Little Torches That You Used To Put By The Bed - We Thought That Was A Lovely Idea When We Visited Before - Especially If You Wanted To Get Up In The Night. Pillows Were Really Disappointing - Very Flat With Little Substance. Turndown/Evening Service Was Excellent - They Even Emptied All The Bins (Seldom To You See That Level Of Attention To Details) Cleaning And Bed Making On A Morning Was Exceedingly Good And Very Fast - Every Morning When I Returned From Breakfast They Had Been And Gone - Thank You,,,,,
,260,Disappointed That There Appeared To Be 2 Single Beds Pushed Together.,,,,,
,262,It Is Inevitable  But The Lodges Are Beginning To Show A Bit Of Wear And Tear.  This In No Way Diminished My Enjoyment  But Might Be Something Someone Staying For The First Time Might Notice.,,,,,
,263,The Internet Seems To Be An Issue Not Just For The Rooms But Also For The Staff Who Are Also Off Line.  I Would Love The Internet To Be More Easily Accessible.,,,,,
,266,Again Not A Real Problem But The Explanation About Access To The Wi-Fi  From Your Room  Was A Little Confusing.  Stated We Had Access To 1 Mb Which Meant Nothing To Me.  Would Have Been Better To Say 30 Free Minutes Or Similar.,,,,,
,269,Carpet A Little Sad!,,,,,
,273,No,,,,,
,275,Unfortunately The Milk In Fridge Was Out Of Date By 5 Days & Sour & The Milk Replaced On 2/10 Was Dated 2/10 & Also Sour!! The Bathroom Could Have Been Cleaned Better Around The Wash Hand Basin.,,,,,
,278,The Wall And Ceiling Were Stained As Was One Of The Cushions Which Spoiled The Room. The Shower Screen Did Not Fit Well And So The Shower Caused Water To Spill Out. We Did Not Have A Fridge And No Milk. There Was Only 1 Chair,,,,,
,279,Surprisingly Very Hot!,,,,,
,280,Very Spacious And Comfortable Although Bathroom Was Basic - Functionally Fine But For This Level Of Hotel Expect Something Better.,,,,,
,281,The Bed Was Far Too Soft For Me,,,,,
,282,I Had To Change Rooms Due To A Block Toilet. The New Room Had A Stained Valance Sheet And Cushions. The Milk Provided In The Fridge Was Out Of Date And Off. I Provided My Own Milk.,,,,,
,284,A Better Shower,,,,,
,285,Very Spacious,,,,,
,286,We Had A Small Problem With Teh Bathroom Plumbing And The Staff Were Very Helpful In Arranging To Move Us To Another Room. It Didn't Affect Our Stay At All  We Loved The Floor Covering In The Bathrrom And Want To Know What It Is  So We Can Have It Fitted In Our Own House!,,,,,
,288,Bathroom Shabby,,,,,
,292,The Bedroom Was Lovely And Although We Couldn't Access The Internet Or Telephone Line Due To No Signal In A Way That Was Nice!,,,,,
,294,Not Mentioned On Booking That The Bath Had A Shower Over  Would Have Preferred A Walk In Shower.,,,,,
,295,My Husband Had Some Difficulty Plugging In His Cpap Breathing Machine Since The Nearest Sockets Were Round Holes. Also I Have To Use Non-Perfumed Bathroom Products But My Husband Liked Yours,,,,,
,301,The Hot Water Is Almost Dangerously Hot And You Need To Take Care  Otherwise The Lodges Are Excellent,,,,,
,303,Tv Signal Was Intermittent/Unreliable. Phone Signal Was Almost Non-Existent  And Was A Cause Of Considerable Inconvenience.,,,,,
,304,Some Of The Furnishings  Bathroom Fittings Etc.  Dated For Cost,,,,,
,305,I Would Have Preferred More Access To The Internet With A Better Wifi System That Is Free,,,,,
,306,On Thursday 9 May 2013 The Wind Was Blowing Through The Windows Of Our Suite And It Was Very Cold In The Room In The Afternoon And Evening. I Asked The Staff At The Reception To Have Some Heating In The Room But Somehow That Never Materialized.  We Think That The Room Looks A Bit Tired And Needs Re Decorating. The Furniture Is Damaged And Needs Some Attention.  The Beds/Sheets/Pillows Were Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,308,Extremely Comfortable And Beautifully Serviced....Noyhing Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,309,Bedroom Lovely  Had Issues With Internet Had To Call Reception Who Got It To Contact Us And Eventually Got On Line,,,,,
,311,Only Problem  Internet Was Quite Slow The Whole Time (I Do Understand- As It Is A Big Place). Also- Bbc Iplayer Was Too Slow To Watch On Tv  And There Wasn't Freeview- E4 Or Music Channels. With The Surroundings- People Would Not Need These  But It Would Have Been Nice To Have An Option For Music Somewhere. Place To Plug In Ipod Speakers Perhaps?,,,,,
,317,We Stayed At The Claret Tor(C3) We Stayed Here Earlier In The Year Also. I Have A Couple Of Comments. Firstly The Plumbing To The Upstairs Shower Could Be Improved ( Maybe Installing A Pump) As The Shower Power Is Very Low .  Also There Was Green Mold Round The Bath Plug Disk  Noticed This After The Bath When There Was A Green Mark Round The Bath. Also There Is A Smell Of Damp In The Larger Bedroom Downstairs  I Noticed This During Our Previous Stay But Did Not Mention As I Thought I Maybe A One Off But It Was Still Present At This Visit.,,,,,
,320,We Thought The Carpets Could Have Been Cleaner - There Were Lots Of Stains On The Stair Carpets And In The Bedrooms.  Perhaps They Could Be Steam Cleaned Between Bookings.  It Also Seemd That The Carpets Were Not Vacumed During Our Stay.,,,,,
,322,We Felt That The Shower Should Be Separate To The Bath - No Mat So If You Were Unsteady You Could Slip!  We Asked For Feather Pillows On The 2Nd Evening And They Were Forthcoming - No Problem.,,,,,
,324,When We Arrived Our Room Was Very Cold   As The Radiator Was Out Of Order.Thankfully The Porter Brought Us A Convector Heater To Solve The Problem.,,,,,
,326,Thank You For Restoring The Complimentary Wi-Fi  Without Having To Get A Code.  Up Till Two Years Ago  The Grills Were Complimentary. Then Last Year You Introduced A Charge Of Â£50 Per Day. Now The Charge Is Â£10 Per Day For The Gas Cylinder. It Would Be Nice If The Grill And Gas Were Included In The Rental.,,,,,
,327,View From Room 20 Fantastic.,,,,,
,329,The Bathroom Was Very Poor  With Dark Decor And Bad Lighting And It Was Not Modern  Which We Had Requested,,,,,
,331,We Were A Little Disappointed With Our Bedroom As The Dã©Cor Although Tastefully Done Was A Little Tired.,,,,,
,333,There Was A Large Stain On The Carpet And The Bathroom Was A Little Bit Tatty But The Room Was Lovely With Some Really Nice Features.,,,,,
,334,On Arrival At The Lodge It Was Clean But Not Exceptionally So. The Next Day The Standard Of Cleaning Had Noticeably Improved.,,,,,
,337,My Husband And I Both Agreed That For A Five Star Hotel Our Room Should Of Been Immaculate  But Sadly It Wasn't  There Was Mould Around The Windows  And Around The Bath  The Bath Side Panel Was Coming Off And Just Looked Untidy And To My Horror There Was A Pair Of Men's Socks Underneath One Of The Chairs Which My Husband Disposed Of  I Wanted To Complain But It Was Rather Late In The Evening When We Noticed This. We Felt That These Issues Aren't Acceptable For A Five Star Hotel.  Disappointingly We Didn't Have A View To Speak Of From Our Room.,,,,,
,338,The Hot And Cold Water Should To Be Mixed In The Wash Basin. The Plastic Floor Dose Not Look Nice With All The Spots And Next To The Hairdryer Plug Should Be A Mirror.,,,,,
,340,Very Nice Decor  With Comfortable Pleasant Surrounding.,,,,,
,341,The Weather Was Very Hot When I Stayed  It Is Better To Have An Air Conditioner In The Room.,,,,,
,342,I Would Have Thought That A Hotel Such As Bovey Castle Would Provide Free Wifi To Guests . Without Wifi  You Are Reliant On 3G And Cell Phones  Neither Of Which Work Too Well In This Area,,,,,
,346,It Was Extremely Cold When I Arrived.  I Thought The Heating Wasn't On But After Struggling To My Knees (I Have Arthritis) I Found The Radiator Indicated It Was At Its Highest Level But It Was Barely Warm. I Was Preparing To Go Home At That Point  But When I Went Down To Supper I Reported The Matter To Your Charming Reception Team Who Said They Would Get Someone To Look At The Radiator And Also A Stand Alone Heater.  When I Returned From Supper The Room Was Less Chilly  But The Stand Alone Radiator When I Put It On Warmed The Room Up.,,,,,
,347,Only Issue Was That Despite Giving Ages Of Kids And Needs Re Beds They Had Put A Cot In The Room.  Lady Who Showed Us To The Room Easily Rectified Situation But Wasn't What I Had Asked For.,,,,,
,350,Initially We Were Shown To A Room Which Had Noisy Fans From The Kitchen Right Outside The Window. We Couldn't Open The Window For The Noise. There Was Also A Big Round Stain On The Carpet. When We Complained We Were Found Another Room Which Was Slightly Smaller But Well Appointed. The Staff Were Very Helpful Throughout.,,,,,
,351,The Chair Was Stained And The Valence Around The Bad Was Shabby. Prefer A Separate Shower Not Over The Bath. Overall The Room Did Not Reflect The Cost Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,353,Bathroom Was A Little Narrow ( Room 21 ),,,,,
,355,I Was Disappointed To Find That There Was Not Free Wifi-We Had Several Mobile Devices  None Of Which Could Get Signal  So Free Broadband Would Have Been Welcome. We Bought 1 Package But Couldn't All Use Our Smartphones Etc.,,,,,
,356,Re Bath  Shower  Basin - The Brown Water Took A Little Time To Get Use To,,,,,
,359,Bed Was Very Soft So Had To Sleep On The Very Edge Where It Was Firmer Both Had Back Ache In The Morning.  Milk In The Fridge Had Gone Off. Was Kept Awake By Banging Bistro Door At Night And Again 6.30 In Am. Also Glad No One Was On The Bistro Terrace As They Would Have Been Looking Straight Into Our Room. Also Brown Stain On Bedspread.,,,,,
,361,The Bathroom Needed Redecorating. Blinds And Wallpaper Were Damp And Damaged. Room 10,,,,,
,362,The Coffee Sachets Were Fiddly And Messy To Use,,,,,
,364,The Wifi Access Is Not Clear And The In Room Brochures Imply There Is A Charge. Needs Updating.,,,,,
,365,Internet Should Have Been Free And The Rooms Need To Be Touched Up. The Bathroom Could Do With Fond Work And There Was Dust In Places.,,,,,
,366,We Thought The Decor Was A Little Tired In Our Room (38) And We Weren't That Impressed With The Tv Setup.,,,,,
,367,I Was Very Disappointed That The Bathroom Appeared A Bit Tatty  The Door On The Shower Kept Getting Stuck And The Soap Dish In The Shower Fell Off As Soon As Any Product Was Placed Upon It  Revealing A Rotten / Rusty Couple Of Screws.  This Meant That There Was Nowhere To Place My Products  And Being Heavily Pregnant  This Caused Problems For Me As I Was Not Able To Bend Down To Put The Products On The Floor.,,,,,
,369,Room 52 Was Nice But Not Exceptional. Only 1 Shower Gel For Two People. Toilet Blocked :-(,,,,,
,370,One Of The Clean Folded Towels In My Room Was Dirty And Looked Like It Had Been Used As A Dog Towel!  This Didn't Bother Me As There Plenty Of Others Though.,,,,,
,372,Showing Some Signs Of Wear And Tear  Carpet And Wood Veneers - Would Of Been Less Happy If Paid Rack Rate But Still Paid A Heavy Upgrade Fee.,,,,,
,374,The Lodge Was Lovely But A Couple Of Things Niggled  Such As Paying For Unlimited Internet But Only Being Able To Use Two Devices.  Also The Shower In The Main Bedroom Downstairs Had Too Small A Screen And The Water Went All Over The Floor Each Time It Was Used.  Also On A Couple Of Occasions The Cleaning Staff Had Left The Lodge Iwth The Downstairs Door Unlocked.,,,,,
,377,We Stayed In Room 46 And On Arrival And During Our Stay There Was A Steady Ingress Of Water Coming Through The Window Stone Work That We Had To Continually Mop Up - Although Not The End Of The World  Visibly It Is Not Very Appealing To Have So Much Damp And Water In Your Room.,,,,,
,378,The Bed Was Joined In The Middle Causing Un Comfort  The Shower Head Was Broken,,,,,
,379,We Stayed In Rooms 35 And 36  Which Were Quite Old And Tired  And Also Room 36 Was Right By The Very Noisy Kitchen Extractor Fan  And Overlooked The Gravel Drive Way  So It Was Very Noisy At Night Time  Especially As The Room Was So Hot And We Had To Keep A Window (Which Was Also Broken) Open For Some Cool Air.,,,,,
,381,Only Problem Was That I Was Charged Â£100 For Smoking In The Room. I Only Had One Cigarette In The Room During The Entire Stay. I Felt That Was A Bit Unfair As There Was No Sign In The Room Prohibiting Smoking. I Did Not Make A Fuss About It So As Not To Ruin The Stay.,,,,,
,382,Tv Didn't Work Very Well - Poor Reception And Some Bugs On Carpet In Morning!,,,,,
,385,There Are A Couple Of Chips In The Bedside Tables Which May Need Attention. (Hound Tor H2),,,,,
,386,Lovely Room But Couldn't Get Internet Access Very Well.,,,,,
,387,There Were Moschitos Around 10 Per Room An This Was A Problem. Also The Lodge Was Cold To Start With. It Would Have Been Better To Heat It More In Advance. The Staff Was Helpful In Getting Extra Heating.,,,,,
,388,Clogged Drain In The Bathroom Sink. Windows That Cannot Be Opened. 'House Directory' Does Not Correspond With Actual Appliances  Furnishings In The Cottage,,,,,
,392,A Fridge In The Room Would Be Useful,,,,,
,393,We Were In A Lodge (G3) And For Whatever Reason The Tv And Washer/Dryer Were Mystical Experiences - Got Them To Function In The End But Was Not Great (Ever After Checking The Washer Manual). Just A Comment - Still Very Pleased With Lodge Accomodation !!,,,,,
,397,The Bathroom Was Small For Such A Large Room However It Was Functional And Well Appointed  Only Input Was That There Was No Where To Put My Own Toiletries,,,,,
,398,Fantastic  Well Equipped Fantastic Views!,,,,,
,400,Internet Was Spotty And Tv Didn't Work At All Times.,,,,,
,403,Was Very Surprised That You Charge For Wi Fi. The Inability To Make/Receive A Mobile Phone Call Was Bliss!,,,,,
,404,These Comments Relate To Kitty Jay Lodge.  I Was Disappointed To Find That Helpful Holidays Have Changed Their Policy And No Longer Offer Guests Bathrobes Or Toiletries.  I Have Stayed In This Lodge Three Times And Hope To Return Again.  However I Must Remember To Bring An Ice Cube Tray Next Time As There Is Never Any Provision For Ice.  The Barman Helpfully And Promptly Provided Ice For Us So A Vital G&T Could Be Enjoyed After A Long Journey.,,,,,
,405,Unfortunately Due To The Heat Wave The Room Was Very Hot And Difficult To Sleep In. Although I Asked For A Fan This Did Not Really Cool The Room Down,,,,,
,406,Tv Control Seemed Very Complicated And Difficult To Navigate. No Radio 4? The Tv Also Froze On A Couple Of Occasions And We Had To Switch Everything Off And On At The Plug. Not Clear If There Was Free Wifi (Feel There Should Be) And Instructions Should Be In The Room. Neither Of Our Radiators Seemed To Work (Reported This On The First Morning But Not Fixed). That Said  Not Needed As The Room Was Very Warm. More Information About The Hotel (E.G. History And Local Walks) Should Be In The Room By Default. Also Further Information About The Area (E.G. Dartmoor Guide/Visitor Newspaper) Should Also Be In The Room.  ,,,,,
,407,The Lighting Was Very Poor  Just The Bedside Table Lamps  None On The Desk For When Using The Mirror  And Also I Had To Pull The Desk Out In Order To Use The Socket For The Hair Dryer,,,,,
,408,Internet : Should Really Be Included In Price Of Room/Lodge And Be For A Large Number Of Devices. So Did Not Actually Use As The Limit Of 2 Devices Is Impractical--&Gt; 2 Adults  1 Older Teenager  1 11 Year Old = 2 Laptops  3 Ipod Touch  1 Ipad. Also To Be 100% Honest Did Not Actually Miss Internet Usage But The Rest Of The Family Did.,,,,,
,411,It Was Disappointing That We Could Not Access The Internet As There Appeared To Be No Signal That Our Laptops Could Pick Up.  The Television Remote Control Would Not Work Properly And Hence It Was Very Frustrating Trying To Watch Anything Or Change Channel.  The Toilet Seat Was Improperly Fitted And Would Not Stay In An Upright Position  It Kept Falling Down.  It Was Extremely Hot And The Radiators Were On In The Room.,,,,,
,412,The Room Internet Is Somehow Not Satisfied As Some Of My Colleagues Including Me Not Able To Access Our Company Network Via The Vpn Connection. It Was Determined To Be Some Internal Feature Problem To Some Of Your Wireless Wifi Agent In Different Hotel Rooms Areas.  This Is Being Proved As I Can Plug In The Ethernet With Wired Cable To The Wall Rj45 Socket And Able To Connect Our Vpn Network With No Problem.  It Is Only Abnormal Performed In The Wireless Wifi Network Inside The Hotel Rooms And Guests Restaurant Area.  I Have Reported This But Not Able To Resolve Successfully By Your It Support.,,,,,
,415,Tea Making Facility Is Terrible - Strange Cleaner Smell In Kettle  Milk Off - Fresh Milk Is Good But Is Fridge On ? Toital Disaster As A Result. More Balnkets  Duvets In Room  For Choice ? Better Smellies In The Bathroom.,,,,,
,418,The Room We Occupied Was Excellent Family Accommodation,,,,,
,419,No Comments,,,,,
,420,Bathroom Badly Needs Refurbishment Particularly The Cracked Sink And Poor Drainage Lampshades Very Tatty,,,,,
,422,The  Polyester Pillows Were Not Comfortable  I Would Have Expected A Hotel Of Your Standing To Have A Choice.  Socket For Hairdryer Was Not Near Enough A Mirror ,,,,,
,423,It Would Have Been Nice To Know If The Products In The Fridge Where Chargeable.  The Young Lady Who Took Us To The Room May Have Said  But Trying To Take Everything In That She Said I Think I May Have Missed A Little.  I Would Also Like To Have Known If There Was A Charge For Using The Slippers Provided In The Bathroom.                          Also We Had No Instruction On How To Use All The Facilities On The Tv.,,,,,
,424,It Was At Times A Little Too Hot In The Room. The Corridors Leading To The Room (We Were In Room 10) Were Very Hot. Sometimes Uncomfortably So. I Think You Could Get Away With Turning The Temp Down Generally Without Impacting On Guest Experience.,,,,,
,426,Noisy Air Condition Units Outside Could Be Heard,,,,,
,427,I Think That Internet Should Be Free In An Hotel Of This Quality,,,,,
,428,Haytor Lodge. Wanted To Sit Out - Balcony Hadn't Seen A Broom Since Last Season? Plus No Outdoor Cushions. No Full Length Mirror - Why? Tiny Teapot For A Lodge Sleeping Six - Why? No Washing Up Basin. Poor/No Cleaning Of The Various Venetian Blinds Throughout The Property. Carpets Needed A Good Clean - Lots Of Stains And Marks Which Was A Shame.,,,,,
,429,There Was A Used Cotton Bud Left On The Bathroom Floor  The Coffee In Our Room Was Past Its Use By Date & The Complimentary Milk In The Fridge Was Past Its Sell By Date. I Reported These Matters To Reception.,,,,,
,432,No Teletext On The Television,,,,,
,433,We. Were In Room 16 After Being Shown Into Another Guests Occupied Room By Mistake And Our Room Was Disapointing As The Light Shade Was Filthy With Dust This Being The Main Light In The Bedroom We Also Had Cracked Crockery In Our Wooden Box And Were Surprised There Were No Robes But Slippers Were Provided .,,,,,
,434,Overall Fine But The Wardrobe Was A Little Flimsy.,,,,,
,435,Internet Access In The Room Was Very Slow. We Did Not Know That We Could Upgrade To A Faster Connection.On Our Last Day We Used The Hotel Computers Which Were Of Course Much Quicker.,,,,,
,436,Economies Are Noticable - Only One Bar Of Soap  Sloe Gin Has Been Discontinued  Only Four Breakfast Tea Bags And When More Requested Only Given Four More,,,,,
,437,We Didn't Need A Full Set Of Towels Every Day  Or A Fresh Milk In The Fridge. But Not A Criticism  The Room Was Wonderful.,,,,,
,439,Pillow Was Extremely Hard And Uncomfortable And Bed Was Too High And Soft Couldn't Get Comfortable Enough To Sleep.,,,,,
,442,We Stayed In Room 15 For Two Nights. An Excellent  Comfortable Bed Which Gave Us A Good Nights Sleep. Quiet  Peaceful Location. Water Was A Little Discoloured In The Shower But We Did Understand The Reason For This. Even South West Water Is Often Discoloured But Unfortunately  As In Our Business City People Do Not Understand!,,,,,
,443,The Original Room Allocated (After The Upgrade Was Recognised) Suffered From The Same Problem As Other South Facing Rooms  I.E. Double Glazed Window Units Which Had Leaking Seals  Which Results In Severe Condensation; This Really Is Poor Given The High Standard Expected.,,,,,
,446,Only Comment I Would Make Is That The Tv Reception In Room 10 Was Not Good And Had To Boil Kettle On Bedroom Floor As There Was Not A Suitable Surface To Place A Kettle Near A Power Point,,,,,
,449,The Bathroom Products Were Not Replaced During Our 4 Night Stay  On Small Bar Of  Admittedly High Quality  Soap Was Not Good Enough Really.  Yes We Should Have Complained  But At Over Â£300 A Night I Would Have Thought This Was Unnecessary,,,,,
,453,Rather Small,,,,,
,455,Very Spacious And Well Equipped. Everything Very Clean And Tidy  Including The En-Suite Facilities. No Negatives.,,,,,
,456,No - It Was Very Comfortable,,,,,
,457,The Bath / Shower Would Benefit From A Hand Rail,,,,,
,460,No Hot Water For First Day. Key Did Not Work Twice. Bbc 2 Not Available --Weak Signal.,,,,,
,463,The En-Suite Room Was In A Corridor And Was Cold And Draughty. When Taking A Shower The Part Of The Body Away From The Spray Became Cold As The Cubical Was Not Totally Enclosed.,,,,,
,465,I Ticked That I Wasnt Able To Access Internet Easily Because There Did Not Seem To Be Free Wifi,,,,,
,467,I Think The Design Of The Rooms Etc Is Quite Outdated. Old Fashioned Wallpaper Mainly!! You Don't Walk In And Think 'Wow'. Internet- Can't Believe You Don't Have Free Wifi Like The Rest Of The World Nowadays! Couldn't Even Access 3G On My Phone We Were So Out Of Range! However  Overall The Second Room We Were Given Was Nice Enough- Not Entirely What I Was Expecting But Good Sized Room  Bed And Bathroom So We Were Happy. And Clean!!,,,,,
,468,Our First Room Was Slightly Smaller Than I Had Hoped For. However  Despite Being Valentines Weekend And Very Busy  The Staff Were Extremely Helpful At Upgrading Us To A Room That I Preferred Much More.,,,,,
,470,The Decor In The Bedroom Felt Slightly Tired / Dated. The Wallpaper In The Bathroom Was Peeling Away From The Wall Closest To The Bath  Due To The Moisture Created By The Shower. It Was Disappointing Not To Have A Separate Bath And Shower  And The Bathroom Flooring Was Not Attractive. I Was Slightly Disappointed With The Room Decor As We Felt That The Interior And Design Of The Bars And Restaurant Downstairs Was Far Superior And The Decor Of The Room Was Not In Keeping With This.  The Bed Would Have Been More Comfortable  Had The Pillows Been Feather And Not Foam. The Room However  Was Very Clean And The Complimentary Tea  Coffee And Water Were Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,471,I Was Surprised To Find That Free Wi-Fi Was Not Included - In This Day And Age It Seems A Rather Strange To Charge For Internet Connection.,,,,,
,472,Firstly  I Think That The Lodges Are Amazing  A Great Concept Although They Are Starting To Look A Little Bit Tired In Places - It Would Be Important To Maintain The Quality.  One Of The Girls Mentioned That It Would Be Good To Have An Oven Glove And A Few More Tea Towels Available.,,,,,
,474,The Room Was Situated Next To The Lift Shaft And This Was Noisy At Night And Early In The Morning. The Bathroom Needed A Bit Of Redecoration - There Were Damp Patches In The Wallpaper. I Also Noticed That The Decorative Cushions On The Bed Were All Stained Which Wasn't Particuarly Nice. I Appreciate The Room Might Only Be Redecorated Occasionally But Surely Its Not Too Much To Ask To Have Cushions That Are Clean. Perhaps It Was Because We Were On A Discounted Stay That We Were In This Room But Had I Paid Full Price I Would Have Been Disappointed.,,,,,
,475,King Bed Was Two Twin Beds Pushed Together  Creating That Uncomfortable Crack Down The Centre.  Otherwise  The Bed Was Comfortable However The Pillows Were Well Below Standard.   Also  Problems With Both The Hot Water  Water Pressure And Television During Our Visit.  I Would Rank The Rooms 6/10  However The Experience And Facilities Outside The Rooms Were A Comfortable 8/10.,,,,,
,476,The Room Was Very Small And Seemed Quite Dated. We Were Very Surprised By This; The Standard Seemed Far Below Everything Else At Bovey Castle And It Is The One Thing That Would Put Us Off Staying With You Again. We Did Not Think It Represented Good Value For Money At All And Can Only Assume That We Were Allocated This Particular Room Because We Had Booked On A Package Deal  Which Is Perhaps A Little Short-Sighted On The Part Of The Management.,,,,,
,478,I Thought The Bedroom Was Lovely  However I Was Very Disappointed With The Bathroom.  The Floor Was Marked (It Appeared To Be Stained With Toothpaste) And I Do Not Think This Is Acceptable Given The Room Price.,,,,,
,483,The Room Was Of A Much Lower Standard Than The Rest Of The Hotel  The Room Was More Like That Of A 3 Star Hotel  The Walls Were Cracked  The Floor Uneven  The Curtains Dirty  Especially In The Bathroom Where They Had Discoloured  The Bed Was Not As Comfortable As Befitting Such A Star Levelled Hotel.,,,,,
,486,Although There Was A Notice To Say The Water Was Safe We Did Not Like The Idea Of Using Brown Water To Clean Our Teeth. We Ended Up Using The Bottle Water Provided.,,,,,
,488,For A Luxury Hotel It Was Disappointing The Room Had Cobwebs In The Shower And Stains All Over The Carpet,,,,,
,489,It Was Beautiful But Housekeeping And Broken Bathroom Fittings Let It Down. There Were Many Dead Flies Under The Curtains  Didn't Like My Baby On The Carpet,,,,,
,491,We Needed To Plug The Telephone In Ourselves Before Use  Which Was A Bit Strange. In Addition We Were Surprised That We Had To Pay For The Internet Access Given The Cost Of Room Should Be Sufficient For The Wifi Connection. We Expected A (Small) Seating/Lounge Area At The Room Rate We Selected. Maybe This Should Be Clarified On Your Website?,,,,,
,492,I Always Prefer A Seperate Bath And Shower Which We Didn't Have  Although That's Not A Major Issue For Me. I Did Find The Room Very Hot Overnight  Despite The Window Being Open. Perhaps A Fan In The Room Would Be Useful?,,,,,
,493,Clean  No Oders & Lovely View!,,,,,
,500,Bathroom Had Stains On The Wall,,,,,
,502,The Room Was Small But The Ample Bathroom Made Up For It. Lovely Bathroom,,,,,
,506,The Position Of The Plug Sockets In The Room (Number 15) Were At The Wrong Height For The Length Of The Cable For The Kettle For It To Be On The Floor  And There Were None Near A Table Where The Kettle Could Be Rested.  The Only One That Was By A Surface Was Behind The Tv Which Would Be Dangerous With The Steam From The Kettle.  I Had To Move A Bedside Table To The Other Side Of The Room To Keep The Kettle On.    My Bed Felt Like Two Singles Pushed Together As There Was A Gap Down The Middle So I Could Only Sleep On One Side Of The Bed,,,,,
,508,There Was No Dressings Gowns In Our Room When Asked For Some To Be Bought Up  We Were Made To Feel Like We Were Lying And An Inconvience. When The Lady Bought Them Up My Husband Opened The Door And Thanked Her And Went To Take Them He Got Told No That She Would Brinh Them Into The Room  She Took Them Into The Bathroom And Put Them On The Back Of The Door Almost As If She Was Checking We Werent Lying And Just Trying To Get More Dressing Gowns.,,,,,
,509,The Bedrooms Are Fantastic  However The Bathrooms Are Basic And Not Consistent With The Rest Of The Hotel,,,,,
,510,Too Hot,,,,,
,514,Was Disappointed Not To Have Been Offered An Upgrade For Our Special Occasion  But The Room Was As Described And Comfortable.,,,,,
,516,Beautiful. And The Personal Touches Like The Weather Forecast Made It Even More Special.,,,,,
,518,Interet Connection Was Difficult,,,,,
,519,Radiator Broken. Reported It But It Wasn't Fixed,,,,,
,521,Very Noisy From The Corridor.,,,,,
,522,Bed Sheets Were Not Fresh Although The Bed Was Very Comfortable. Bad Internet Reception,,,,,
,524,In Room Literature Stated You Had To Pay For Internet Which Didn't Feel Was Good Enough For This Type Of Hotel. After Departure I Found Out That This Isn't True  Which Was Annoying.,,,,,
,526,The Shower Head  Picture Frames And Light Fittings Werefull Of Dust. The Fast Internet Was Not Working And I Had To Come Down To Reeption To Purchase An Access Code,,,,,
,528,Twin Bed Was A Bit Narrow  But I Don't Suppose That Can Be Helped,,,,,
,529,Cleaning Staff Knocked On My Door At 8:15Am On A Saturday Which  To Me  Is Unacceptable. I Also Spoke With Numerous Other Guests Who Had A Similar Experience That Day And Were Unhappy About It.,,,,,
,530,I Didn't Think That You Should Be Charging For Wifi. It's Free All Over The Place These Days So Charging Guests Who Are Already Paying To Stay Didn't Sit Well With Me. I Didn't Bother Using My Ipad.,,,,,
,532,Bathroom Layout Was A Bit Awkward. I Expected The Products To Be A Bit Better. The Bed Was Comfy.,,,,,
,533,It Lacked The Wow Factor I Was Expecting.This Could Be Down To The Rest Of The Castle Interio Being So Amazing,,,,,
,536,Was Slightly Dissapointed To Be In A Single Room. Didnt Expect This Quality Of Hotel To Have Single Rooms.,,,,,
,537,Some Things Were In A Very Odd Location In The Bedroom - The Kettle Was Stored Under The Tv  With The Plug In Another Location  And The Box Containing The Cups  Tea Bags Etc Was On The Other Side Of The Room!!! I Felt Like I Was Walking Backwards And Forwards For About 5 Minutes Just To Get A Cup Of Tea Sorted!!! They Should All Be Much Closer Together. A Couple Of Additional Sockets Would Also Be Appreciated.,,,,,
,541,I Did Have A Problem With Flies In My Room (There Were Around 50) Which Was Dealt With Fairly Quickly Although Aparently It Was Due To The Fact That I Opened The Window. I've Never Experienced This At Any Other Hotel And I Did Have To Open The Window As The Room Was Baking Hot And Turning Down The Radiators Was Not Effective.,,,,,
,543,I Had The Impression That I Would Have A Slightly Better View Due To Information On The Website.,,,,,
,544,There Does Need To Be Some Upgrades  A Fresh Coat Of Paint And Wallpaper Repairs In The Bathroom. It's Beginning To Look Tired.,,,,,
,547,Quite Expensive For What It Was (Both Size And Decor).,,,,,
,549,There Was Black Mould In The Shower Cubicle.  The Wardrobe Door Would Only Shut If You Slammed It Shut Very Loudly.  We Did Not Have A Fridge.  Apart From That  It Was All Lovely.,,,,,
,550,Bed - Was 2 Single Bed Mattresses Put Together So There Was A Dip In The Middle Which Was Unpleasant. Internet Was Not Easy - You Had To Get A Code From Downstairs.,,,,,
,553,It Was Very Warm  Even With All The Radiators Turned Off,,,,,
,555,Comfortable  And Given The Snow  Surprisingly Warm. Only Thing Was I Found The Bed To Be Too Hard For Both Of Us.,,,,,
,556,Room Was Too Hot At The Time...,,,,,
,558,None,,,,,
,559,The Room Was Extreamly Hot And Stuffy. We Were Unable To Turn The Temp Down. The Room Also Was On The Staircase And Was Very Hard To Sleep With Creaking Floorboards And Noise From Other Bedrooms Above. When We Eventually Managed To Sleep We Were Woken Very Early By Banging From The Upstairs Bedroom.,,,,,
,560,We Thought The Room Was Beautiful But The Bathroom Let It Down.  It Was Small And Tatty Compared With The Room.,,,,,
,561,The Rooms Needed Updating - We're In A Desperate Need Of Decoration. Stain On The Carpet Outside Of Our Room.,,,,,
,562,It Was Lovely To Receive The Room Upgrade On Arrival,,,,,
,565,For The Price We Paid We Were Happy With The Room  However If It Was The Normal Price As Stated On Travel Zoo (Â£349 I Think)  We Would Not Have Been Happy With Our Purchase.,,,,,
,566,The Tv Service Was Quite Complicated And Most Of It Was Low Quality  Eg. The Sound And Picture Quality Of The Iplayer Was Terrible And The Film We Tried To Watch Froze And Crashed The Whole System. We Were Unable To Watch The Rest Of The Film Or Anything Else. The Charge For The Film Was Deducted From Our Bill When Asked On Check-Out  But No Other Gestures Of Good Will Were Made.,,,,,
,576,The Temperature Of The Room Was Far Too Hot And Windows Could Not Stay Open.,,,,,
,579,Lots Of Dust Everywhere. Problems With Shower Drain.,,,,,
,581,I Was Staying In One Of Your Lodges And The Only Prooblem I Had Was Getting Too And From The Main Hotel  With Lack Of Gritted Paths Because Of The Snow And Sufficient Lighting,,,,,
,584,Lodges Are Excellent,,,,,
,585,Mattresses Of The Children Were Very Dirty,,,,,
,586,It Is Easy To Access To Wifi Within The Compound Of The Castle.  However  I Am Confused By The Wifi Charges.  It Is Mentioned That Complimentary Access For Up To 1 Mb But I Can Access It The Whole Time Without Further Charges During My Three Nites Stay There.,,,,,
,589,There Were A Considerable Amount Of Cobwebs And Dust In The Large Light Fitting In The Room Which Was Apparent When That Light Was Used,,,,,
,591,The Bathroom Was A Bit Shabby And Small But Overall The View From Our Window Made Up For It!,,,,,
,592,While The Bedroom Was Lovely  It Was A Bit Dated.  The Cleaning Wasn't Great With Some Items Left Under The Chairs/Chest Of Drawers.  The Bathroom Was Very Bare.  There Were A Lot Of Water Marks On The The Wall.  It Could Be Made A Bit More Cosy.,,,,,
,594,The Lodges Are A Wonderful Idea: Intelligently Designed  Comfortably Furnished And Just Separate Enough From The Hotel.  Some Milk (For Tea) And Some Butter (To Accompany The Loaf Thoughtfully Provided) Would Have Been Useful  But Were Quickly Sent Down By Staff As Soon As We Asked.  We Will Definitely Return To This Accommodation Again.  Only One Very Minor Quibble - We Could Not Find A Facecloth Anywhere (A Must With Children)  So Had To Borrow Some From The Toilets In The Main Hotel.,,,,,
,595,Free Wi-Fi Seems More Approriate Given Room Fees,,,,,
,597,The Lodge Was Lovely But The Dryer Was Broken As Was The Sink In The Kitchen,,,,,
,600,There Should Not Be A Charge For Using Wifi For Hotel Customers In This Day And Age,,,,,
,604,Federico  You Promised To Contact Me To Discuss The Issues We Had  Not Heard From You Yet....,,,,,
,608,I Was Very Surprised That You Charge For Wifi.  Even Most Second Rate Hotels Have Free Wifi In This Day And Age. I Even Had Free Wifi In The Local Pub (Ring Of Bells) And On The Train.  I Think That With The Lack Of Mobile Reception  People Need Wifi To Be Able To Keep In Touch.,,,,,
,609,Sharing A Room With Small Children Makes For A Not Very Restful Experience.  Ideally There Would Be A Separate Sitting Area  Which Makes For More Family-Friendly Evenings In Your Room Should You Choose Not To Hire A Babysitter.,,,,,
,611,Disappointing Overall.  Furnishings Were Sparse.  Room Was Very Drafty And Uncomfortably Cold.  Staff Provided Electric Heaters But Only After 4 Requests To Address The Problem -- Only On Checkout  We Were Finally Told (By Cleaning Staff) That They Knew The Radiator Was Indeed Faulty.  Also  Annoyingly Needed To Re-Login To Internet Repeatedly  Given That Connection Would Time Out.,,,,,
,612,The Bedroom Area Was Lovely  However The Bathroom Was Quite Scruffy; Ie Torn Wallpaper And Damp Patches And Very Musty Smelling. The Shower Was Also A Little Poor In Terms Of Water Flow (More Of A Dribble). Not Of The Standard I Expected For A Superior Castle Room.,,,,,
,613,It Would Have Been Nice That The Bath Had A Hand Held Shower Head. This Is Especially Helpful When Washing Children.,,,,,
,615,After The First Night We Were Moved Into Another Suite And The Opinions Above Reflect This  Not The First Room,,,,,
,616,Top Floor Bedroom In The Lodge Was Unbearably Hot Due To The Boiler Cupbaord/Room Next To The Room - We Couldnt Sleep In The Room  Even Wih The Provided Fan  As It Was Too Uncomfortable.,,,,,
,618,Very Warm During The Night; Woke Us Up Both.,,,,,
,619,We Had Some Issues The First Couple Of Nights  Where Our 2Year Old Had Bites/Reaction To Something. Due To This  First Of All My Wife  Then Our Nanny Slept In His Bed With Him; They Also Then Had A Reaction To Something. Myself And My Son Who Slept In Other Rooms Did Not. We Asked Housekeeping To Change The Mattress And The Bedding  Which They Did Without Complaint  Although Pointing Out This Was The First Instance (Which Was Fine). The Skin Reaction Then Subsided. However My 2Year Old Had A Fever For 4Days Which Was Viral (According To The Local Doctor).,,,,,
,620,A Little Worn In Places  But Didn't Spoil Our Enjoyment,,,,,
,623,The Lodge Was Comfortable And Warm But Noise Travelled A Great Deal Making It Difficult To Get Children To Bed Whilst Adults Were Eating/ Talking Upstairs.,,,,,
,626,I Couldn't Find A Safe In My Room (Room 60),,,,,
,627,The Bedroom Was Very Small  With No View And The Bathroom Decor Was Really Tired.,,,,,
,632,The Lodges Were Amazing (We Had 3 In Total).  It Would Be Nice To See The Carpets Cleaned To A Higher Standard  There Is Wallpaper Peeling Off In The Bathrooms In Some Areas And The Balconies Need Some Tender Loving Care.  However  Overall We Were Very Impressed.,,,,,
,635,Lovely Cosy Duvet! Bit Tricky To Find A Good Place To Plug In The Kettle! (Pretty Minor In The Scheme Of Things!!),,,,,
,638,The Bathroom Window Didn't Open Which Was A Shame And I Found The Bathroom A Little Sparsely Furnished Considering The Hotel Is A Luxury 5 Star Hotel. The Decor In The Room Was Fine But Again A Little Ordianary. The Room Was However Large And Spacious. The Table Lamp At The Writing Desk/Dressing Table Needed A New Light Bulb - Bit Shoddy!,,,,,
,639,The Tv And Internet Signel Did Not Work,,,,,
,642,The Windows Were Slightly Rotten. The Curtains Needed To Be Replaced. The Bathroom Was Very Average  I Expected Better.,,,,,
,643,No,,,,,
,644,We Paid To Have Internet Access For The Week  But The Majority Of The Time It Didn't Work  Which Isn't Good Enough If You Are Charging For Wi-Fi.,,,,,
,648,Shower Fixtures Were Of A Poor Quality And Moved In The Wall When We Turned On The Shower.,,,,,
,649,No Handy Connection,,,,,
,650,Need Internet,,,,,
,651,Not Enough Towels.  Bathroom Could Have Used Updating.  Window Condensation Basically Flooded Windowsill.  Otherwise  The Room Was Spacious  Well Cleaned And Suitable.  One Other Odd Comment: The Price Tag Was Not Visible On Any Of The Pay-Per-View Movies  Which Is A Bit Annoying When Managing The Kids' Movie Choices,,,,,
,652,The Lodge Was Very Clean But We Did Find A Few Things Which We Wouldnt Have Expected Eg Some Childrens Drawings On The Floor.  The Internet Access Used To Be Free And This Was The First Time We Were Charged; I Understand Some Hotels Do Charge For This But As A Resort Member I Would Have Expected Internet Access To Be Included In The Membership Fee.  The 2 Device Limit Is Quite Strict Particularly For A Lodge With Multiple Occupants (Even Between 3 Adults We Had More Than 2 Devices) And It Was Also Confusing How To Get 2 Devices Connected  We Ended Up Charging Both Devices To The Room But Apparently We Should Have Called Reception To Request This..... It Was Easily Fixed Though As Reception Kindly Removed The Duplicate Charges When We Checked Out.  ,,,,,
,653,Room 44 Had A Lovely View And Great Design But Some Aspects Needs A Thorough Clean.  The Bed Valance On The Side Facing The Window Was Disgusting With Lots Of Stains And The Bathroom Floor Was Dirty Around The Toilet Area.    Also The Room Is Quite Noisy Due To The Lift Equipment And Whilst This Didn't Particularly Bother Me I Think You Ought To Be Aware Of It As This Would Be An Unsuitable Room For Someone Wanting Peace And Quiet.,,,,,
,657,It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Bath.,,,,,
,658,A Number Of Light Bulbs Went Whilst We Were There  And Also The Telephone Didnt Work Properly For The Whole Stay. Despite Repeated Requests To Reception To Get This Fixed  It Was Never Fixed.,,,,,
,659,Able To Access The Internet Easily  But I Would Have Hoped For Free Fast Broadband In Your Hotel.  Charging For Decent Broadband Is One Of Those Little Annoyances That One Doesn't Need When Staying At Such A Lovely Hotel.,,,,,
,663,We Stayed In One Of The Lodges. The Outdoor Door Handles Kept Coming Off  So We Had To Leave The Room Unlocked Because The Hardware Kept Falling Off! There Was No Safe (Or Not That We Found) In The Room. And There Were A Lot Of Dings In The Wall That Needed To Be Repaired And The Walls Were Dirty. Although The Lodge Felt Newly Built  It Seemed To Have Some Significant Wear And Tear. And The Bathroom Flooring Was Gross - There Is No Way You Can Keep That Clean. I Can't Imagine What Lurks Under That Weave! Lastly  For The Price  It Seems Reasonable That Wifi Be Included In Our Stay. I Sound Like I'm Complaining  But Just Giving You My Honest Opinion Since You Asked :) Although The Lodge Wasn't That Nice (With All Ikea Furnishings)  The Hotel Itself Was Really Lovely  As Were The Grounds. Everyone Was Really Friendly.,,,,,
,665,Charging For Wi-Fi  Especially For Each Device Used Seemed Very Odd For A Hotel At The Top End Of The Scale.,,,,,
,666,The Sleeping Room And The Lounges Are Agreeable.,,,,,
,667,Bedroom Was Lovely But The Bathroom Was An Odd Shape -Would Be Hard To Navigate Around The Shower To The Toilet (If You Were A Larger Person!),,,,,
,673,The Bed Was Layn Down And Sohlt Be Relaxed  Not Good For People Sharing As A Double ,,,,,
,676,Why Is There Only Plastic Milk. When The Valet Takes You To The Room An Offer For Fresh Milk Or Tea To Be Brought Up Would Be Nice.,,,,,
,677,Unfortunately Room 17 Was A Little Noisy Given It's Position By The Main Stairs  And Maybe That Should Be Reflected In The Price A Little More.,,,,,
,681,Bit Dated,,,,,
,683,Lodge G4: 1) Reading Lights Ought To Be Available In Both Sitting Room And Master Bedroom  2) Full Length Mirror Needed In Master Bedroom 3) Shower Screen Not Adequate To Prevent Water Going Everywhere In Master Bathroom 4) Hot Water Not At All Adequate A Change Of Boiler System Prehaps Required?,,,,,
,689,Clean  Spacious  Attention To Details 1 Little Inconvenience Is To Connect The Kettle To A Power Point,,,,,
,692,The Radiator Was Broken So I Could Not Turn It Off And The Room Was Very Hot. The Shower Door Would Not Shur Properly. There Were Only 2 Keys For A 3 Roomed Lodge  Which Was Not Ideal. Apart From That It Was Very Nice.,,,,,
,695,Spider 2 Day's Running In The Lodge (Ground Floor Room),,,,,
,697,A Little Tired,,,,,
,700,Having Logged Onto The Free Internet  I Subsequently Discovered That Burges Salmon Had A Full Conference Code.  However  It Seemed Impossible To Get Back To The Right Page For This.,,,,,
,701,I Booked 2 Rooms - 1 For My Family (Room 21) And One For My In-Laws (Room 5).  Room 21 Was Good Size  But Bathroom & Shower Too Small And Room Decor / Appearance Could Use Some Freshening.  Room 5 Was A Bit Small And View From That Room Is Horrible / Not Appealing And Again Interior Could Use Some Freshening.  It Wasn't Horrible But For A 5 Star Accommodation I Expect More And Was Disappointed With The Views Of Those Rooms.,,,,,
,702,Very Nice Room.  It Turned Out That We Had Been Upgraded From The Room That We Booked Which Was Great.,,,,,
,703,The Only Thing That We Were Not Thrilled With Was The Room And Bathroom  Although We Had Paid For A Superior Castle Room And The View Was Lovely.  I Dont Recall Seeing An Accurate Picture Of The Room (Especially Bathroom) On The Webiste Prior To Booking.  The Bathroom Although Fine  Was Dated In Terms Of The Tiling And Suite  Although Not Poor By Any Means  If You Are Trying To Keep Things Top Notch  Consideration Should Be Given To Re-Fitting The Bathrooms On This Floor.  The Bedroom Was Again Fine (The Mattress On The Bed Was Very Comfortable) But I Guess Looking At The Pictures On The Website We Got The Impression The Room Was Going To Be More Spacious Than It Was.,,,,,
,705,My Husband Was Quite Frustrated With The Internet Connection.,,,,,
,706,We Were Kindly Upgraded To A Junior State Room  However  On Our Arrival At The Room  The Room Was Incorrectly Set Up With An Extra Bed And The Television Did Not Work. It Took The Maintenance Man Several Trips To The Room To The Fix It And 3 Housekeeping Men To Remove The Bed. It Was Not Very Relaxing And A Bit Intrusive For The First Hour Or So With So Many People Coming And Going!,,,,,
,707,The Lodge Was Beautiful  However On The First Night The Waste Disposal Unit Blocked Causing A Flood Under The Sink And The Water Would Not Drain Away.  Secondly The Shower In The Upstairs Bathroom  Was Not Sealed Against The Bath And Each Time We Used It The Floor Would Flood And Water Came Through The Ceiling Downstairs.  Maintenance And Housekeeping Kept Giving Us Additional Towels But In The End We Used The Showers In The Downstairs Bathrooms.,,,,,
,709,We Stayed For 3 Nights Had No Heating For 2 And Also No Hot Water!!! We Were Assured When Booking That The Lodges Were Very Warm.  When We Arrived It Was Freezing And Took 24 Hours To Warm Up Not Satisfactory For Â£400.00 Plus A Night!!!!,,,,,
,711,Interent Access Not Straightforward And Don't Agree With The Charges. We Were Also Doubly Charged (Although This Was Rectified),,,,,
,712,Bedroom Was Beautiful. Hard To Find A Suitable Electrical Outlet For The Hair Dryer (None In The Big Bath Room) And I Had No Phone Connection In Most Of The Hotel Which Made It Hard To Make Some Business Phone Calls. However The Problem With Connectivity I Fully Understand In Your Location.,,,,,
,713,One Of The Dressing Gowns Was Slightly Yellow Around The Neck And Indeed Had A Couple Of Make-Up Marks On It.,,,,,
,718,Internet Should Be Free (Or Charged Through The Room Rate).  Have Not Been To A Hotel Recently That Charges Separately For Internet  Especially Given The Mobile Reception Is So Poor At Bovey.,,,,,
,721,The Suite Was Underheated - Only One Old Fashioned Radiator For A Large Room  Requiring Additional Heaters To Be Brought Up.  The Size Of The Suite Was Underwhelming For The Price Asked; The Bathroom Especially Was Underwhelming And We Would Have Expected A Separate Shower Unit For This Price Range.,,,,,
,723,As A Family Of Four We Stayed In A State Room  Which Was Lovely  But Would Be Nice To Have Interconnecting Rooms Or Some Division In Room As Children/Adults Go To Bed At Different Times,,,,,
,728,I Didn't Like That The Bed Was Two Beds Pushed Together As They Separated In The Night And Left A Gap In The Middle Which Was Uncomfortable  Other Than That It Was Excellent,,,,,
,730,The Lodge Was Too Far From The Hotel And With The Snow And Ice Was Difficult (And Dangerous) To Get To. Assistance In Getting To The Lodge Was Variable With Staff Experiencing Challenges With Cars Being Broken Or Insufficient Cover On Reception To Help Transport Guests.,,,,,
,732,Some Of The Furniture Was A Little Tired,,,,,
,737,For A 5 Star Hotel And Considering The Cost Of The Room I Was A Bit Disappointed By The Standard Of The Room - It Was A Bit 'Tired' In Places... I Have Stayed At The 4 Seasons Many Times And It Was Not Up To That Standard.,,,,,
,738,The Pull Out Sofa Bed Was So Uncomfortable That Both Children Refused To Sleep On It. I Slept On It One Night.  My Spouse Did The Other Night.  I Can Tell You Exactly How Many Springs It Has - It Was Not A Restful Night.,,,,,
,740,The Quality Of The Bathroom Was Not Commensurate With The Price We Paid.   We Have Stayed In Many Other Hotels In The Uk And Paid The Same Price Or Less And Had Bathrooms Of A Far Higher Calibre.  The Price For A Room Of This Size And View Was Also Too High.,,,,,
,741,Huge Tv Is Terrific But Glows In The Dark And Needs To Be Turned Off At The Plug To Sleep,,,,,
,742,Very Spacious,,,,,
,743,Considering The Price Paid  The Bedroom Was Nice But Not Amazing. I Realise It Was Only The Classic Room  But I Wasn't As Wowed By That As I Was With The Rest If The Hotel.,,,,,
,744,We Struggled With The Internet Connection For The First Few Days.,,,,,
,746,The Tv Did Not Offer A Wide Enough Variety,,,,,
,755,If I Remember Correctly It Was A Rather Dark Room And Also Pretty Old...To Some Extent Charming However Could Be Due For Upgrading?,,,,,
,756,The Milk In The Fridge For Tea/Coffee In The Morning Was Very Badly Off.... Housekeep It Bought New Milk And Mugs Very Quickly  - But It Really Stunk. Impossible To Plus Kettle In Without Balancing On Books And Box To Make Tea  - All A Bit To A Huge Effort Then Biscuits Provided In The Tea Box Were Soft.. Such A Shame!,,,,,
,759,Really Nice Room With Lovely Touches Eg Tea And Coffee Provided. This Was Mentioned By Porter When We Entered Room  And Was Very Important  As Sometimes We Prefer To Make Our Own Tea  As Service Can Be Very Slow.,,,,,
,761,I Had Problems Linking Into The Wi-Fi At The Castle...However  The Staff Were Very Good About Putting Me In Touch With The Help Desk And They Got Me Sorted.,,,,,
,762,Very Poor Considering The Price. We Have Stated In Far Superior.,,,,,
,763,On Arrival At The Hotel We Were Allocated Room 17.  In My Opinion  This Room Was Not Up To The Standard That One Would Expect When Staying At Bovey Castle.  It Does Not Compare Well With Rooms I Have Previously Stayed In At Bovey.  I Realise That It Is The Cheaper End Of The Accommodation  But It Is Still A Considerable Price To Pay For A Small Room With A Narrow And Poorly Equiped Bathroom.   More Bizzarely  The Bed Spread Was Covered In Recently Dried Blood Stains And Was Otherwise Generally Filthy.  The Reception Staff Handled This Well And We Were Quickly Offered Another Room - We Ended Up In Room 15 Which I Gather Was In A Higher Price Bracket.  Room 17 Was Appalling Though.,,,,,
,768,The Radiator In The Bathrooms Didnt Work. The Heating Went Off For Several Hours In The Afternoon Which Made The Rooms Too Cold To Stay In. It Did Not Feel Very Relaxing. The Door Keys Kept Getting Stuck.,,,,,
,771,I Stayed In A Lodge  Some Wallpaper Needed Repairing In The Bathrooms And There Were Scuffs On The Wall In The Stairwell Which Needed Touching Up.,,,,,
,772,Stayed In Bedroom 4. In My Opinion The Room Was Dirty  Dirty Headboards  Dirty Sofa  Dirty Blinds  Clear Signs Of Water Damage In Bathroom. I Was Informed That The Only Way Of Heating The Room Was By Using A Portable Electric Heater As The Hotel Does Not Turn On The Heating At This Time Of Year. The Door To The Bedroom Showed Signs Of Being Forced Open As Did Other Bedroom Doors.,,,,,
,773,More Neutral Colours  Particularly In The Batheroomns Would Have Been Much More Preferable - Too Many Patterns And Very Dark Colours. The Bedrooms Themselves Were Much Better. Some Fresh Flowers Would Have Been Nice  Rather Too Many Plastic Plants Which Collected Dust. Also The Shower Screen Was Not Wide Enough - Water Just Sprayed Onto The Floor And Had To Be Mopped Up With Bath Towels (The Bath Mat Was Nowhere Near Big Enough To Mop Up The Water). Very Good Pwerful Shower Though! And Able To Wash The Bath Towels In The Washing Machine  So Not A Probelem  Just Rather Slippery.,,,,,
,774,Cracked Walls In The Room  Dirt In The Bathroom,,,,,
,775,Mattress Very Uncomfortable.  Not Anti-Roll.,,,,,
,776,Looked Rather Tired And In Need Of Some Updates. Kettle Had To Be Placed On Floor As Nowhere To Plug It In.,,,,,
,777,I Felt That If There Is No Internet Access For Iphone Etc Either Than In The Bistro It Should Be Included In The Room Rate.,,,,,
,778,Stayed In G3 Lodge   Master Bedroom Bathroom Had Wall Paper Peeling Off And Floor Tiles Lifting. Dressing Gowns Were Very Small  Not Luxurious At All.,,,,,
,779,Bathrooms Need Upgrading. Room Was Beautiful But The Bathroom Was Awful. Using Shower  The Water Wouldn't Go Down.,,,,,
,781,There Were Damp Stains On The Walls In The Bathroom Which Was Dissapointing For A 5* Hotel. Feel The Design Is A Bit Dated  But Probably Suited To A Large Country Hotel. Comfortable  But Not Really My Personal Taste.,,,,,
,782,Each Time I Have Stayed In A Lodge And Noticed That The Carpets Do Not Get Hoovered During The Stay  It Would Be Nice If This Could Be Done Even Every Other Day.,,,,,
,784,Very Kindly Put Us Into A Connecting Room And Upgraded One Of The Bedrooms.,,,,,
,785,Lodge Was Fantastic..,,,,,
,790,A Bit Disappointed With The Suite,,,,,
,792,We Liked The Bedroom But Not The Position. It Was Very Noisy The Night We Stayed With Vans Coming And Going And A Unit Of Some Sort Outside Of The Window.,,,,,
,793,Lovely Room But Health And Safety Issue Having To Put Kettle On Floor As Nowhere Else Suitable?,,,,,
,794,For Stays Of More Than One Night The Toiletries Such As Shampoo And Shower Gel Were Not Sufficient.However Upon Request They Were Quickly Replenished.,,,,,
,795,We Have Allergies To Feather Pillows. The Allergenic Pillows. We Were Given Were Awful- Flat  Old  Uncomfortable. You Should Invest In Good Hypo-Allergenic Pillows!,,,,,
,796,Carpet/Rug Had Not Been Hoovered  There Were White Dogs Hairs Throughout The Suite. Requested Room To Be Hoovered  This Was Done Immediately.,,,,,
,797,I Was Really Disappointed With My Room And Asked If There Were Any Other Ones Available. The Staff Were Really Understanding And Helpful. I Was Given An Upgrade.,,,,,
,802,Windows Are Leaking.  Temperature In Hotel In General Is Too Warm.,,,,,
,804,Mattress Showing Its Age  Very Lumpy. Furnishings Starting To Get Tatty  For Example Chips In Glass/Mirrored Chest Of Drawers (Dangerous)  Tears In Fabric On A Seat  Stains On Furnishings & Carpets.,,,,,
,810,The A/C From The Bistro Was Very Loud! However  Next Day We Became Another Room. This Was Smaller  No Toothbrush Glass  No Bath Robes.,,,,,
,811,Disappointed With The Standard Of Decor  The Blind In The Bathroom Looked Filthy And Stained  The Tiles Were Cracked And Poorly Repaired  The Wallpaper In The Bedroom Was Stained And Had What Looked Like A Squashed Insect Smeared Behind The Bedside Lamp And There Was No Latch On The Window.,,,,,
,812,The Room Was Cold  Admittedly On A Particularly Cold Weekend  But Heaters Were Brought In And A Comfortable Temperature Reached. Lack Of Plugs In The Room !,,,,,
,816,We Felt Our Original Room Was In Need Of Redec. (Eg Damp On Wallpaper In Bathroom)  Had V Poor Lighting  Lacked Privacy (Unless Blind Down/ Curtains Drawn One Could Be Seen From Car Park)  And Was Noisy: Could Hear Next Door All Too Clearly And What Sounded Like A Lift Shaft All Night. On Request We Were Moved To A Better Room Which We Felt More Adequately Justified Our Room Rate.,,,,,
,819,The Internet Connection Kept Failing - I Was Using Both Iphone And Ipad  And I Frequently Had To Reset My Connection  In The Room And In The Public Areas Of The Hotel  Whichever Device I Was Using,,,,,
,820,Lodge Was Very Nicely Appointed But The Sofa Fabric Was Torn And The Carpet In The Living Area Was Very Stained - Other Stains On Bedroom Carpets.  The Wallpaper In The Master Bathroom Was Patched And Coming Off In Places.  The Little Blinds In The Bathrooms Do Not Hang Properly - Possibly The Strings Are Broken.  These Are Details But Do Detract From The Luxurious Feeling Of The Lodge.,,,,,
,822,Good Idea To Have 'Free Internet' For Low Usage. Bathroom Looked A Bit Tired But Still Functional,,,,,
,823,Loved The Detour In All Bedrooms,,,,,
,824,Shabby Dated Decorations  Wall Paper Stained And Peeling  No Fridge  Silly Little Toiletries In Bathroom- Luxury Hotels Have Larger Products ( Hand Soap Was Ridiculous!) Bathroom Cold  No Music System  And Cracked China Cup Which Leaked My Morning Tea All Over Me On Saturday Morning Was Left In Saucer And Actually Replaced When The Room Was Serviced  So Only One Usable Cup On Sunday Morning!!!!,,,,,
,827,The Toilet Seat Was Difficult To Put Up And Down (Room 37) Our Bed Was Very Small Which Was A Shame As I Was Sharing With A Colleague And Felt That It Could Have Been Organised A Little Better When Allocating The Rooms For Single Occupancy,,,,,
,830,The Staff Turned Up To Do The Turndown At 7.25Pm When We Were Getting Ready For Dinner And Also It Was Still Light So It Was Not A Good Idea To Close The Curtains At This Time And Remove The View Which We Specifically Booked The Room For. On The Monday We Had A Knock On The Door At 09.10 And It Was Housekeeping Wanting To Make The Room Up  We Were Checking Out The Same Day And Had Not Been To Breakfast Which Did Not Finish Until 11.00Am So Somewhat Premature From Housekeeping.,,,,,
,831,Very Noisy As Overlooking Access To Car Park. Could Hear Cars (And Their Radios) Coming In Early Morning (Room 12),,,,,
,832,The Original Room We Were Allocated Was Not What We Were Expecting Or What I Considered I Had Booked. We Were Very Swiftly And Professionally Moved To A More Suitable Room. Therefore What Could Have Been A Large Issue Disappeared Due To Excellent Management Skills. Thanks To Donna & Federico.,,,,,
,833,It Wasn't That Clean.  The Bathroom Blind Was Filthy And The Bedcover Stained With Marks (Pen Etc). We Got The Feeling That We Were Not In A Room Given To Those Without Children Despite Having A Older Child Who Isn't Prone To Damaging Things!  The Room Was Noisy In The Early Mornings With Deliveries And Cars Coming And Going Outside.  No Chance For A Lie In!  We All Needed A Rest.  So That Wasn't Great.,,,,,
,835,We Were In Room 35 And The Noise Of The I Believe Kitchen Exhaust Fan Was Quite Pronounced Particularly As We Needed The Windows Open On A Warm Night. But This Noise Far Less When We Closed Window And Thick Curtains. As We Were On Travelzoo Offer And Are Easy Sleepers We Weren't Going To Complain Over Such A Trifle But Other Guests Might Be Less Forgiven,,,,,
,836,Room Was Clean. Bed Very Comfy. Bottled Water Was Plentiful. No View But Obviously Blocked By Another Building (Room 33). At Low Season Would Have Been Nice To Be Upgraded But I Appreciate That With Weddings All Rooms Were Probably Committed.,,,,,
,839,I Have Stayed At Bovey On A Number Of Occassions And Certainly Felt That The 1St Bedroom We Were Given Was Quite 'Tired' Regarding Presentation. The Small Room That Was Intended For My Son To Sleep In Had Black Around The Window Which I Assume Was Mould And There Was A Cupborad In The Bathroom Which Was Taped To The Wall. These Are Just 2 Examples That Dissapointed Me.,,,,,
,840,We Were In Room 3 And It Was Very Noisy As Next To Cafe So All Day And Into Late Evening Noisy And Also Above Swimming Pool So Aircon Noise Was On All Night. Was Also A Very Warm Room,,,,,
,843,Not Your Fault Someone Left Us A Biscuit In The Kettle!,,,,,
,844,The Light Over The Mirror In The Bathroom Wasn't Great For Applying Makeup.,,,,,
,845,Internet Speed In Room (42) Very   Very Slow. Internet Whoulf Be Inclused In Room Rate (It's 2012!),,,,,
,846,I Could Not Get The Television To Work And Asked For Help Twice From Reception But None Came And  I  Was Still Not Able To Get It Working At The End Of My Stay .,,,,,
,847,The Tv In The Lounge In Our Lodge Was Too Small,,,,,
,848,Shame About The Leaky Windows - But Not Really A Problem,,,,,
,850,I Would Have Liked To Have Some Ambient Lighting In The Bathroom - It Was Very Stark. Also No Fridge!  One Of The Lamps Did Not Work.,,,,,
,852,We Spent One Night In Arch Tor.  It Smelled Of Insect Spray - Housekeeping Tried To Tell Us It Was Exhaust From The Boiler (Not Really A Better Answer!!) - But It Was Insect Spray.  The Unit Was Not Clean - Seems To Have Been Unused For Some Time.  Carpets And Furniture Were Stained And Soiled. We Were Moved To Eleswood Rock - Which Was Better.  But  Still Soiled And Not Really Clean.  Couches In Particular Were Soiled.  Housekeeping Was Not At All Good.  Kitchen Garbage Not Removed  Floors Not Washed  Food Left In Sink  Coffee-Maker Not Cleaned.  Worst Was Pots And Pans In The Cabinet With Old Food Still On Them - Disgusting,,,,,
,853,A Lovely Room And We Appreciated The Upgrade For The Extra Space. But  Ceiling In Need Of Some Attention (Room 15),,,,,
,857,There Was Only One Socket For The Table Lamps At The Desk. It Was Impossible To Plug In The Computer And At The Same Time Have Proper Lighting On The Desk.  The Bathroom Was Very Humid And The Wallpaper Went Off At A Number Of Spots.,,,,,
,858,I Felt The Rooms Were Dated  Our First Room The Bathroom Light Kept Flickering On & Off & Not A Good Reception From The Tv Also  There Was Damp On The Ceiling Above The Window  We Upgraded Again  The Room Was Ok  I Just Felt They Were In Need Of A Refurbishment.,,,,,
,859,The One Drawback To Our Stay Was That The Room Was Overly Warm.  We Had The Window Open All Night And It Still Felt Stuffy.  The Room Number Was 13.,,,,,
,862,Our Tv Didn't Work,,,,,
,863,It Was December  The Bathroom's Towel Rail/Heating Was Not Working. I Mentioned It To The Reception Staff And The Lady Said She Would Inform Maintenance. Nothing Was Done And The Bathroom Remained Very Cold.,,,,,
,865,Soft Pillows Would Have Been Nice From The Start But After The First Night We Asked For Them And There Was No Problem Having Them,,,,,
,866,The Plumbing In The Bathroom Was Not Working Very Well ..The Toilet Would Not Flush Properly  Specially At Night.,,,,,
,869,The Bed Was Far Too Soft For Are Liking.,,,,,
,871,Unfortunately We Ended Up In One Of Your Disabled Rooms Which Had Disabled Bathroom And It Wasn't Quite What I Visualised Experiencing While We Were Staying With You,,,,,
,875,I Would Mention The Duvet Which Was The Wrong Way Around Inside The Duvet Cover.  This Is Something That Has Been Consistently The Case Since I First Came To Bovey Castle Six Years Ago And I Feel It Is About Time It Was Remedied.  The Duvet Cover Has No Duvet In It At The Sides And The Duvet Is Hanging Out Of The Cover At The Bottom Of The Bed. Duvet (But Not The Cover) Needs To Be Turned Through 90 Degrees And All Will Be Well!  The Televisions Still Don't Work.  This Has Been The Case For Several Years And We Would Love To Watch Some Christmas Tv.  A Duvet For Beds Up To 5' Wide Is Longer Than It Is Wide.  6' And More And The Duvet Is Wider Than It Is Long  As Is The Duvet Cover.,,,,,
,881,Was Disappointed To Find So Many Cobwebs Across The Windows.,,,,,
,882,We Stayed In Room 1  The Wheelchair Accessible Room.  Just Need To Mention A Couple Of Things: No Plugs At Wheelchair Height  Plus A Table Suitable To Eat From (As We Ordered Room Service For Breakfast & Dinner) Would Have Been Helpful.  Also  The Shower Was Very High & If My Companion Had Not Had Me To Assist Her She Would Have Found It Difficult To Reach.,,,,,
,884,Very Warm And Comfortable.,,,,,
,885,Fresh Milk In The Room  Maybe In A Small Fridge With The Water  Would Be Nice Touch And More In Keeping With The Luxury Feel Of The Room.,,,,,
,886,Our Room Was Overlooking Car Park Which Could Be Quite Noisy At Times,,,,,
,887,The Standard Was Inconsistant Regarding The Turndown In The Evening. Fudge Only Left Once.,,,,,
,888,It Was Clear That Refurbishment Had Occurred But Also There Were Some Items Left Undone Like Wallpaper Pealing Or An Area Not Painted Properly. We Were In 35 And 36. Perhaps That Was Intentional But Gave The Impression That Proper Attention Was Not Being Paid To The Rooms.,,,,,
,889,While The Experience At Bovey Is Always Very Good  It Is A Little Irritating To Have To Purchase Internet Access  Particularly When Mobile Reception Is Poor.  Internet Comes Free With Most Hotels And Is Expected.  Otherwise A Fabulous Stay.,,,,,
,892,The Tv Chanels Were Out Of Order Which Was Frustrating. Lighting Levels Were A Little Dim. The Main Door Lacked A Security Chain And The Door Appeared To Have Been Forced At Some Time In The Past. The Milk In The Fridge Was A Great Idea  However Quality Needs To Be Maintained As The Milk Was 'In Date' But Had Turned Sour.,,,,,
,893,The One Thing That I Felt Was Missing Was An Alarm Clock - Preferably A Digital Alarm With Docking Station So That We Could Listen To Our Own Music.  We Really Appreciated The Bottle Of Champagne In Our Room Upon Arrival.  This Was A Lovely Touch.,,,,,
,894,Tv Did Not Work Properly.  Would Not Turn Off.,,,,,
,895,Needs Renovation. Not Even A Powerpoint For A Haidryer,,,,,
,896,Stayed In A Valley Room For The View. Dissappointed That The Sealed Windows In Room 42 Are Full Of Condensation So You Cannot Enjoy The View.,,,,,
,897,Thank You For The Upgrade,,,,,
,898,It Stays Very Warm And Does Not Cool Off Even With The Windows Open,,,,,
,899,There Were Some Noises That Sounded Like Scuttling Of A Mouse Above The Room In The Night. I Guess It Is An Old House And Added To The 'Country House' Experience But Was A Little Disconcerting.,,,,,
,900,Room 3 Could Hear Humming From Swimming Pool Fan? Would Prefer Another Room  Also There Was A Terrace Outside The Bedroom  Fortunately It Was Not Warm Enough For People To Sit  But  Would Have Preferred To Be On 1St Floor. However We Loved The Room And Would Definitely Like To Come Again,,,,,
,902,Room 29 Where We Were First Shown Has A 'Fan Hum'. Changing Rooms Was Swift And Efficient,,,,,
,903,It Needing Some Tlc,,,,,
,904,We Were In Room 35. I Liked The Decor (Although Bathroom Is A Bit Worn In Places) But The Situation Did Make It Feel Like The Poor Cousin That It Was  Next To The Kitchen Vents And Other Service Areas. Given The Lack Of Mobile Signal It Would Have Been A Good Gesture To Have Had Access To Free Wifi (As Has Been The Case In Other - More Remote - Places Where We Have Stayed). Although I Rarely Use My Mobile I Did Need To Use My Ipad  But Didn't Want The Pfaff Of Signing Up/Paying Etc When I Didn't Know Whether I'd Want An Hour  A Day  2 Days Etc,,,,,
,905,Lack On Mobile Phone Reception Was A Problem,,,,,
,906,Bbc2 - No Sound. Front Door Very Stiff. Door Handles To External Verandas All Came Off,,,,,
,908,One Side Of The Bed Was Very Uncomfortable. It Seemed Worn Out On One Side . The Television Did Not Work And Could Not Be Fixed.,,,,,
,910,When We Had Changed Rooms The New Room Was Definitely Superior.  The Bathroom However Was Poor - Old  Tired  Stains On Walls And Really Not Up To Scratch,,,,,
,912,The Bedroom Was Fine. The Main Problem Was The Bathroom Was A Bit Dated. I Know Taht It Is Not Always Possible To Have A Walk In Shower But I Do Expect A Shower Attachment On The Bath Otherwise You Can't Wash Your Hair And Its Nice To Have A Double Ended Bath Tub.  The Toilet Seat Was Broken Although It Was Fixed After Asking A  Couple Of Times.,,,,,
,914,Re Internet  I Thought It Ridiculous In Such A High Cost Room That Free Wifi Was Not Available,,,,,
,916,Our Room Was Lovely But For The Price We Paid It Was Too Noisy. It Would Not Put Me Off Staying Again  But I Would Not Want That Room Again (Room 27),,,,,
,917,Internet Access Kept Dropping.,,,,,
,918,It Took Several Phone Calls To Get The Internet Working (Handled Well By The Reception Team).  Restricting The Access To Two Devices Is Totally Inadequate In A Lodge Sleeping 6.  Charging For Wifi Is Old Fashioned And Hotels Should Not Do This.,,,,,
,920,Not Having A Decent Mobile Signal Is A Growing Problem I Woudl Suggest For You.  Even Though I Was Staying With Your For Leisure It Was A Constant Irritent Not Being Able To Receive Phone Calls From My Office And Having To Change Plans So I Could Be In A Place Where There Was A Phone Signal.  Perhaps You Should Consider Reducing Your Hotel Phone Charges To Compensate.,,,,,
,921,We Had An Issue With The Fire Alarm Going Off And Then The Heating Not Working But The Management Were Aware And Offered Us A Free Night And Dinner,,,,,
,922,Had A Smell On Arrival. When Reported To Reception House Keeping Did Something But A Slight Musty Smell Did Linger,,,,,
,923,A Single Sink With No Countertop To Put Anything On Is Hard To Share And Very Impractical.,,,,,
,924,The Noise From The Kitchen Area And Air Conditioning Unit Was An Issue  It Was 11.30 Pm When It Stopped And 6.10 Am When It Started Again. We Asked Twice Before We Were Given A Room In Castle. Which Was Okay For Our 2Nd Evening.,,,,,
,925,Too Hot Even With All Radiators Off.  Windows Open But It Was Very Noisy At The Front Of The Hotel During The Night But Specifically Early Morning.  Fridge Did Not Work And Was Very Noisy During Th Night.  Milk Was Off In Morning.  Turn Down Service Excellent,,,,,
,928,We Upgraded To Room 34 From A Standard. First Room Was Somewhat Disappointing. Room 34 Was An Improvement With A Pleasant Ambiance However We Were Initially A Bit Disappointed With Unsightly Stains On Top Bedcover. As We Had Already Moved Rooms Once And Did Not Want To Move Again Delaying Our Chance To Settle In And Relax We Did Not Bring It To Staff's Attention  However You May Wish To Rectify This For The Next Guests In Room 34.,,,,,
,933,This Was Superb - Comfortable  Clean  Beautifully Decorated  Opulent .........,,,,,
,936,A Bit Noisy At 7Am On One Morning When Classic Cars' Engines Were Being Started.,,,,,
,939,The Internet Access Should Be Free For A Hotel Of This Standing.,,,,,
,940,The Window Glass Was Not Clean  Ie There Were Large Smudges Where Someone Had Leant Their Forehead Against It  There Were Water Stains On The Ceiling From A Leak And The Headboard Of The Bed Had A Very Obvious Stain On It.,,,,,
,941,Room Seemed Slightly Gloomy Due To Poor Lighting,,,,,
,942,Room/Annex Smelt Of Damp.,,,,,
,944,Internet Did Nit Work Well For 2 Days. Weak Signal,,,,,
,945,Disgusting Carpets,,,,,
,947,The Decor Was Dated And Very Average  There Was No Fridge  The Room Was Far Too Hot  As Was The Bed (Plastic Undersheet? Or At Least Something That Held The Heat!)Resulting In A Poor Nights Sleep.,,,,,
,957,Bathroom Was A Little 'Tired'  Could Do With A Touch Up To Dã©Cor Here And There,,,,,
,959,I Believe Our Room Was Next To A Staff Room Or Where The Cleaners Kept Their Supplies  Therefore  Of A Morning We Could Hear A Door Opening And Closing Regularly Quite Early.  We Were In Room 5.,,,,,
,962,Space For Clothes Was A Little Limited. There Was No Mirror Near A Power Socket For Hair Drying.,,,,,
,967,No Mini Bar Is No Acceptable At This Level Of Hotel.,,,,,
,969,Toilet Seat Was Skewed Making Using It Risky. Paint On Mullioned Windows Falling Off  Mould Present. Stains On Carpet  Armchair And Sifa Too. Also Expected Dried Fruits And Nuts As Used Previously But Nothing Was Waiting.,,,,,
,971,My Daughter Found The Sofa Bed Springs A Bit Hard So We Made It Back Into A Sofa And She Was Fine.  Last Time We Stayed She Had A Small Bed Made Up For Her Which She Preferred But We Were In A Larger  Better Room This Time As We Had An Upgrade  Kids!,,,,,
,973,It Was Located On A Busy Corridor  Which Meant It Was Noisy At Night And Early Morning. This Should Be Advised In Advance.,,,,,
,974,The Bathroom Lacked A Bit Of Imagination.  With The Space You Could Offer A Separate Bath And Shower Which I Do Expect In An Upgrade Room At A 5* Hotel,,,,,
,976,Bed Cover Was Soiled.,,,,,
,979,Tatty/Tired  In Places For A 5 Star Hotel,,,,,
,982,Room Very Cold  Windows Did Not Close Tight Enough.  Asked For A Heater As Feating Not On Which Made To Room Comfortable.,,,,,
,983,Charge For Internet Was Frustrating. Add The Cost To The Room Charge Rather Than Charging For Use.,,,,,
,987,Not Enough Toiletries--Child Robe For A 17 Year Old.When We Arrived Not Shown Where The Safe Was---Thought There Was Not One Despite Having Valuables.Milk For Tea Not Pointed Out.,,,,,
,989,No Milk Or Spoons   Coffee Sachets A Year Out Of Date  Kettle Had To Be Put On Floor To Plug In To Socket.Tv Did Not Have A Good Signal To Get A Channel To View.,,,,,
,991,Pointed Out The Old Stains By The Sink Which Were Going To Be Put In A Book.  The Bathroom Needed A Good Overhaul To Bring It Up To Current Acceptable Luxury Standard  The Bedroom Door Had Knocks On.,,,,,
,993,The Room Was Very Cold When We First Went In. Made A Tea/Hot Chocolate & When We Poured The Milk It Was 'Off' And Full Of Lumps. We Ordered A New Bottle Of Milk. The Air Vent In The Wall Was Extremely Noisy & We Had To Put Cushions Against It To Stop The Noise. The Wardrobe Had Bolts On The Top Of It......Not What One Would Expect From A Five Star Hotel. The Toilet Handle Knocks Against The Toilet Seat When Flushing. Having Stayed At Bovey Castle Twice Before  Room 32 Was Rather Disappointing,,,,,
,997,Room 10 Great Views Over The Valley And Not Forgetting The Daily Falconry Underneath The Room,,,,,
,998,I'm Not Sure What You Can Go About This  But We Had Trouble Getting A Signal For Our Mobile Phones In Our Bedroom.,,,,,
,1000,We Had A Double And A Single Room. I Felt That At Your Price Point The Rooms   Particularly The Single  Were Small. At Your Price Point I Do Not Expect A Shower Attachment In The Bath And In The Doiuble Room There Was Dark Mould Visible Around The Tiling In The Shower Area. The Unfinished Lock Repairs On The Doors Further Detracted From Any Impression Of Style Or Luxury,,,,,
,1001,Excellent. We Had Allocated The 6 Rooms For The Party Through The Bc Staff And Their Advice Was Spot On.,,,,,
,1002,The Toilet Seat Would Not Stay Up. I Reported This But No Action Was Taken. I Requested A Change From A Duvet To A Single Sheet And I Had To Re-Ask For This To Be Done.,,,,,
,1003,No Good Socket For Kettle Or Hair Dryer. Couldn't See What I Was Doing To My Hair As Mirror Was Miles Away From Accessible Socket For Dryer.,,,,,
,1006,The Television Worked In A Somewhat Eratic Fashion  Otherwise The Room Was Unexciting But Perfectly Pleasant And The Views Were Exceptional.,,,,,
,1007,I Booked The Classic Room Since I Was Traveling As A Single And Did Not Want To Share.  This Is The Description As It Reads On The Website:  Classic Rooms Are Located In The Main Hotel Or In The Mews Within The Hotel Courtyard  With Views Over The Surrounding Woodlands..   My View Was Of The Top Of The Building Next To Me And If I Leaned Out I Could Tell A Little Bit About What The Weather Was Outside (Mabye).  Not Really Any Green To Be Seen.  I Was Very Disappointed With The View.  I Wasn't Expecting The Best View In The Hotel But I Certainly Wasn't Expecting To Be Looking At The Roof Of The Next Building.   Since I Am Not The Type Of Person To Spend Time Outdoors And I Spent A Lot Of Time In My Room This Was Too Bad  But I Didn't Think That Asking For Another Room Would Be Useful (I Tend Not To Make A Fuss About Changing My Room Once It's Assigned).   There Were Other Issues; But Perhaps They Will Come Up Later In The Survey.  The Size Of The Room Was Good And The Bed Was Comfortable.     ,,,,,
,1010,Was Pleasently Warm  But At Night The Bedding Was Too Restricting.  The Duvet Too Heavy And A Single Blanket Too Cool.  As A Result A Disturbed Night Because I Was Too Hot And No Apparent Ability To Alter The Room Temperature.  (Though More Bedding Options Would Have Suited Fine.,,,,,
,1011,A Bed Lamp Cover Did Not Suit Reading In Bed At Night.,,,,,
,1014,Disappointed That You Now Charge For Internet And Bbq Grill. No Flannels Or Shampoo Etc In Bathrooms.,,,,,
,1015,Water Slow And Cool.,,,,,
,1018,The Bedroom Was Too Warm For Comfortable Sleeping.  Perhaps It Should Be Made Clear How The Heating Can Be Turned Down For A More Comfortable Overnight Experience.,,,,,
,1020,Separate Shower Not Available  Doors Banged  Access Difficult,,,,,
,1021,I Travel A Great Deal In Uk And Abroad And The Room Was Totally Acceptable Although I Found The Tv System Rather Cumbersome Compared To Others.   The Hotel Was Quite Empty And The Staff Kindly Accommodated My Wish To Have A Room With Bath.,,,,,
,1022,En Suite Bathroom Carpet Had Some Stains On It Which I Felt Should Not Be There,,,,,
,1023,Thank You For Upgrading Us On Valentine's Night.  Our Bathroom Was A Bit Disappointing But The Bedroom Was Ideal And The View Too.  Room 8,,,,,
,1024,I Thought The Bed Should Have Been Wider  My Husband And I Are Use To A Six Foot Wide Bed And Found Yours To Be Too Narrow.,,,,,
,1025,The Lodge Was In A Beautiful Setting And Equipped To A Very High Standard. The Added Touches Such As The Products In The Bathrooms  The Curtains Drawn And The Lights On When You Return From An Evening Out  The Welcome Pack All Added To The 'Bovey Experience'.,,,,,
,1027,Fridge Not Turned On  Therefore Milk Sour  Could Not Use  Placed Empty Milk Bottle In Bin Assumed A New Bottle Would Be Left For The Next Day  No Replacement Bottle Of Milk Left.,,,,,
,1029,Bathroom Is Very Outdated.,,,,,
,1030,The Room Was Rather Tired And Looked Shabby - E.G. Stained Carpet;Stained Pillow; Window Frame Didn't Fit The Space Meaning Daylight Visible Between Frame And Wall; Bath Panel Damaged And Not Properly Attached(Particulary By The Door)  Paintwood Chipped In Many Places;Metal Plate Behind Shower Control Loose And In Need Of Cleaning; Box Of Tissues Not Replaced When Empty (Only 3 Or 3 Tissue On Arrival)- Had To Ask Twice For This To Be Remedied. Saucers Chipped; Used Wine Glasses Not Cleared Away;,,,,,
,1031,We Did Have To Pay For A Room Upgrade.  The Web Description Of The Superior Castle Room Is Misleading.  The First Room We Were Shown To Had A View Of The Cars Parked In Front Of The Hotel.  That Is Not A View Of The Countryside.  As The Hotel Was Almost Empty It Is A Bit Hard To Understand How This Was The Best Available At That Price.,,,,,
,1032,Would Have Preferred Walk In Shower. In Bath Slippery And Cramped No Grab Handles.,,,,,
,1035,The Bathroom Was Long And Narrow So A Little Awkward And Cool Towards The Large Window. There Was No Bath Which Had Not Been Explained To Us And Would Have Been Nice. There Were No Hooks Or Shelves For Our Bathrobes  Towels  Toiletries  Razors Etc.,,,,,
,1040,The Room Was Unbearably Hot During The Night  Unable To Turn The Radiator Down  Not Much Sleep.,,,,,
,1041,I'm Not Sure If My Fridge Was Working As The Milk  Which Was Within Date  Was Off.,,,,,
,1043,Lack Of Attention To The Needs Of Your Guests. No Info On The Hotel Facilities/Area. Difficult To Locate Somewhere To Plug In The Kettle. Problems With The Tv Remote  Poor Range Of Info On The Tv And No Facility For Subtitles. Bathroom Looked Very Tired With Water Damage In Places  Inadequate Shelving For Personal Toiletries Or Hanging Of Robes Etc.,,,,,
,1045,The Room Nâ° 5 Was Not Worse The Money Paid. I Was Disappointed In All Senses.,,,,,
,1047,Lovely Spacious Bathroom  Bedroom A Little Small,,,,,
,1048,As Our Room Was Located Near To The Pool  We Were Aware Of A Constant Hum From Some Kind Of Machinery  But This Did Not Spoil Our Stay Or Disturb Our Sleep.,,,,,
,1049,Pillows Were Much Too Hard For My Liking  At Another Hotel We Were Given The Choice Of Soft And Hard Pillows  Which Were Labelled Accordingly,,,,,
,1050,The Classic Room Was Very Tired And Was In Need Of Urgent Refurbishment. I Do Not Think For Â£229 It Provided Good Value For Money,,,,,
,1053,Lack Of Mobile Phone Signal A Problem.I'm On O2.,,,,,
,1055,The Room Was Very Warm Which Affected Sleeping.  I Was Cautuios Of Opening The Window As There Was A Type Of Balcony Outside The Window.  I Was Also Concerned With Opening The Window As The Window Stay Was Not Fit For Purpose  Therefore Opening The Window Would Have Caused Damage To The Window.,,,,,
,1056,The Single Room A Little Small,,,,,
,1057,Bed And Room Were Dissapointingly Small For The Rate You Charge,,,,,
,1058,As Is Common  Not Enough Light For Reading.,,,,,
,1060,No Sheet On Bed And Duvet Left Me To Hot Even With Window Open,,,,,
,1061,The Room And Bathroom Should Have Had A Hook For Coats And Bathrobes. Internet Access Was Impossible Unless You Paid Extra (Which We Did Not Do). The Pillows Were Rock Hard But The Bedding And Bed Were Wonderful. All Lighting Was Very Very Soft Apart From The Bathroom. We Were Disturbed By Very Loud Inconsiderate Guests At 2.1  And Again Later In The Morning Probably Because We Were In E Main Corridor And The Door Seal Did Not Have A Tight Fit.,,,,,
,1063,Internet Access Should Be Free At This Level. It Is Now Included In Many Hotels  And Is A Normal Requirement Of Everyday Life.,,,,,
,1064,Would Have Complained About State Of Mattress If Staying Any Longer. Room 2 Left Side Of Mattress Saggy And Uncomfortable. Did Put Us Off Spending Extra Night With You.,,,,,
,1065,Perhaps The Bed A Little Soft For Us But That Is Purely Are Preference. Trouser Press !!!!!!!!!!!,,,,,
,1067,Desk And Chair Were Unsuitable For Working At A Laptop.  Wi Fi Expensive And Cumbersome To Have To Input Daily Codes  No Mobile Signal Either ,,,,,
,1069,The Kettle Could Have Been Located Nearer To The Tea/Coffee.,,,,,
,1070,No Cost For Internet ,,,,,
,1071,We Paid For An Upgrade So We Did Like The Room.   Internet Access Was Very Poor. Many Lower Cost Hotels Provide Free High Speed Internet Access. This Is Close To Becoming A Leisure Industry Standard. The Very Slow Free Internet Access At The Hotel Was  Frustratingly Slow Even For Simple Web Browsing.  Very Disappointing.  Finally  The Tv In The Room Was Mostly Out Of Action. When It Was Working The Simple Act Of Changing A Channel Could Take Multiple Attempts. I Have Stayed At Cheap  Medium Price And High End Hotels And I Have Never Experienced Such A Frustrating Tv. On One Occasion I Asked Reception To Take A Look At It. They Got It Working Temporarily But Overnight It Failed Again. It Was Lucky That The Sun Was Shining Otherwise It Could Have Been A Boring Weekend.,,,,,
,1072,Room 46 The Shower Was Not Brilliant With The Controls  Very Unforgiving  One Small Move And It Got Hot Or Cold..  Plus Having No Door Stop To Keep The Doors Open   From The Front Door To The Bathroom To The Bedroom Was Slightly Frustrating  Why Do You Need A Door On The Bedroom  When You Have Doors Out And To The Bathroom....,,,,,
,1073,Beautiful Room  But One Small Piece Of Soap Between Basin  Bath And Shower?,,,,,
,1075,Beverages - A Dish For Used Tea Bags Would Be Helpful As Would A Cloth To Clean Cups In Between Usage.,,,,,
,1076,We Were Originally In Room 9 And Were Disappointed With The Outlook So Upgraded To Room 10 Overlooking The Valley. We Found The Room Very Hot With No Obvious Way Of Reducing The Temperature Apart From Opening The Window  Which We Did.,,,,,
,1078,When I Left My Room I Locked The Door.  On Three Separate Occasions On My Return It Had Been Left Unlocked.  Hairdryer Flex Did Not Reach The Mirror With Enough Extension To Dry Hair While Styling It.  Inner Doors Banged Due To Spring.  Other Hotel Users Where Not As Quiet In Their Rooms As I Was.,,,,,
,1083,Unfortunately The Rug In The Room Had Curled Edges And Was Dangerous - Otherwise All Fine.,,,,,
,1088,Plugging In Kettle A Bit Difficult Anywhere Convenient,,,,,
,1090,From 6Am Fpr A Couple Of Ours Two Children Were Running Up And Down The Corridor Outside Our Room To And From Theii Room And Their Parents Room Shouting And Screaming -  The Room Door Is Evidently Not Nearly Sound Proof Enough  In Addition We Felt The Bathroom Was Not Of A Standard To Justify The High Price Of Bovey Finally As The Hotel Was Far From Full We Were Disappointed To Be Given A Room Overloooking The Car Parking Area Rather Than One With A View Of The Golf Course Etc,,,,,
,1091,I Was In Room 1 With The Disabled Bathroom.  I'm Happy With A Wetroom Arrangement As I Have This At Home But A More Powerful Shower Would Have Been Appreciated. The Decor In The Bedroom Was Bland In Comparison To The Furnishings In The Public Areas.,,,,,
,1093,The Room Number 5 Was Cold With A Cracked Window With Another Unable To Close Completely. Although We Were In An Entry Level Room We Were Very Disappointed That We Had No View And The Room To Us Was Faded Elegance.  Bathroom Was Average With No Surface To Store Our Toiletries And The Fan Was Noisy.,,,,,
,1095,Our Room Was In Need Of Redecoration. Peeling Paintwork  Large Area Of Paper Coming Away From Ceiling  Screws Rusting In Bathroom  Rug With Curling Corners Now A Trip Hazard.,,,,,
,1096,We Were In Room 17.  When We Arrived The Tv/Radio Was On And Everything Appeared To Be Fine.  But When We Went To Bed  We Became Aware Of A Fan / Pumps / Air Conditioning Unit Running Outside  Directly Below Our Bathroom Window.  We Shut The Window  Pulled Down The Blind And Shut The Bathroom Door  And Hoped That It Would Be Turned Off Later.  At 2.30 Am  The Noise Was Still Keeping Us Awake And I Contacted Reception  Only To Be Told That Another Lady Had Complained About This A Little While Before.  The Young Man Said That He Would Report The Matter To The Manager  But Nothing Was Followed Up The Next Morning.  The Hotel Was Not Full: So Why Was A Room  Known To Have Problems  Let Out That Night?,,,,,
,1098,Please Read Answer To Previous Question With Regard The Original Blighted Room We Were Placed In Which Had Noise From The Hotel's Swimming Pool Pump. We Were Moved To Another Room With Heavily Stained Furnishings And Subsequently Upgraded To A 'Junior State Room' Overlooking The Car Park. The Manager Was Most Kind And Helpful  But Obviously The Unfortunate Start To Our Visit Impacted Greatly Upon Our Visit .,,,,,
,1099,Felt The Bath/Shower Could Have Had A Handle To Make Coming Out Easier,,,,,
,1102,When We Arrived The Room Was Very Cold And Although It Warmed Up In The Early Evening On Our Return After Dinner It Was Very Cold Again. The Bathroom In Particular Was Cold And Did Not Seem To Have Any Source Of Heating.,,,,,
,1104,Bathroom Too Small  No Extractor Fan. Lovely Powerful Shower Though.,,,,,
,1105,No,,,,,
,1106,We Thought 8.30 In The Morning Was Far Too Early To Be Knocked And Asked If We Wanted Our Room Cleaned And Also In The Evening Again At 6.30 For The Turn Down Service.,,,,,
,1107,Our First Room  A Junior Suite  Was On The Front Driveway Without Much View  Which Did Not Seem To Be As Nice A Room As The Rate Would Describe. This Was Not A Problem For Us  As We Did Not Care. The Room Had A Musty Smell Which Was A Problem For My Wife And Myself  As My Wife Has Allergies.  We Then Moved To The Lodge Which Was Very Nice And No Noticeable Odor.,,,,,
,1108,As Previously Stated  We Did Not Realise We Were Having Small Attic Rooms Which Was Disappointing For All Our Party (No Views At All From Some  Only Of The Roof),,,,,
,1110,The Bathroom Was Very Tired And In Need Of A Complete Refurbishment. The Bathroom Blind (Originally White) Was Yellow And Brown From Age At The Creases. The Bedroom Wallpaper And Decorating Were Also Tired And Needed Replacement.,,,,,
,1111,We Were Very Pleased To Have Been Upgraded And Provided With Complimentary Champagne!,,,,,
,1115,Paintwork Around The Bath Needs Refreshing.,,,,,
,1116,Bath & Basin Water Did Nor Drain Away Easily,,,,,
,1120,The Bedroom Was Disconcertingly Cold On Arrival But The Situation Was Quickly Remedied By A Member Of Staff Who Supplied An Electric Heater  Which Was Invaluable. Our Television Didn't Work  Which Was Disappointing.       And It Would Make A Huge Difference To Have Bedside Lights With Bulbs Strong Enough To Read By!,,,,,
,1121,We Had Room 11 And It Was Rather Noisy From The Kitchen Extractor Fans And The Banging Of A Door Fairly Regularly Down Below  Presumably From The Kitchen.,,,,,
,1122,Unbelievably Expensive For What We Received. We Were Charged What I Would Expect To Pay Normally. Needs Decorating  And Service Was Poor. Had To Ask For Clean Towels And The Crockery Was Cracked.,,,,,
,1123,Entrance Door Handle Extremely Difficult To Handle  Eventually Eased By Maintenance Man. Windows Too Hard To Open Only Slightly And Securely  As Stuck Fixtures. Later Made Slightly Better By Maintenance. All Less Than Unexpected.,,,,,
,1124,The Table Was Very Badly Marked And Valence Stained,,,,,
,1125,The Bath Water Was Barely Hot On The First Evening.   There Were No Tooth Mugs/Glasses In The Bathroom,,,,,
,1127,Milk Was Not Replaced,,,,,
,1128,It Was Difficult To Find A Place Other Than The Floor Nfor The Kettle  And The Chmpagne Provided On Our Arrival Was Still In The Room When We Left 3 Days Later.,,,,,
,1131,Room 3 Next To The Restaurant Was Very Noisy. We Could Hear All The Traffic  Particularly Late At Night On The Stairs And Our Last Night Had To Go Into The Restaurant At Close To 11:00  An Hour After We Retired To Ask Them To Keep Down The Noise - Most Of The Problem Was The Door Into The Restaurant Which Made A Loud Bang Every Time Anyone Passed Through It.,,,,,
,1133,Original Room Was Small So Upgraded To Valley View Room Which Was Excellent - Woul Dnot Stay In Standard Room,,,,,
,1135,We Had Room 36 And The Outlook Was Poor From One Of Our Windows.Sometimes The Room Felt A Bit Cool. When We Stayed Last Year We Had A Super Room Over Looking The Grounds So I Was A Bit Disappointed This Time.,,,,,
,1140,It Is Unusual To Charge For Wifi Access Nowadays.,,,,,
,1142,Nit Pick(?) --- There Was No Power Point Near The Desk/Dressing Table So That Ladies Using A Hair Dryer Had A Problem To See In The Mirror Whilst Doing So.,,,,,
,1144,Would Have Preferred Quieter Room Overlooking The Golf Cours,,,,,
,1148,We Stayed In Room 32.  There Was No Mirror Above The Dressing Table - Your Staff Had To Provide One.  The Lighting In That Area Of The Room Was Poor.  The Socket For The Hairdryer Was Behind The Dressing Table  Making It Difficult To Plug In Any Appliance.  The Kettle Had To Stand On The Floor  Due To The Lack Of Correctly-Placed 13 Amp Sockets In The Room.  The Wardrobe Doors Would Only Shut With The Use Of 2 Bolts Attached To Them - Otherwise They Would Constantly Swing Open.  The Wardrobe Was Shallower Than A Standard Coathanger  So The Hangers Had To Be Tilted On The Rail To Get The Doors To Shut. The 2 Stairs Leading To The Bathroom Had No Handrails  Which Could Prove Difficult For Some Guests. Pleased Accept That These Are Observations  But We Felt That The Room Was Not Up To 5* Standard Due To These Points.,,,,,
,1149,Would Have Preferred A Glass Tumbler To Have Been Available In The Bathroom Not In A Cupboard,,,,,
,1155,Very Comfortable....Let Down By The Wee Fact That There Was Not A Glass/Beaker For The Washhand Basin...Other Rooms Had One/ So Assume It Had Been Forgotten.,,,,,
,1156,No  Everything Was Fine.,,,,,
,1157,This Refers To The Room #18.  The Lodge Was Fine But Far Too Big  Difficult To Keep Warm And Too Far From The Hotel.,,,,,
,1160,Perfect!,,,,,
,1162,The Throw On The Bed Had A Big Visible Stain. The Bathroom Fittings Were Not Up To The Room Price And The Decor Was Scruffy.   It Was In Need Of Upgrading And Redecorating.,,,,,
,1164,This Was The Second Room.  The First (29) Was Noisy  The Air Conditioning Unit Outside Very Intrusive.  Since We Had Come For A Peaceful Break  I Asked To Be Relocated And This Was Agreed.  We Were Very Grateful To Be Allocated A Valley Room At No Extra Cost.  However  You Have A Problem With Rooms Above The Air Conditioning Units.,,,,,
,1165,Suggest A Smaller Television With Better Quality Sound,,,,,
,1166,The Bathroom Was Extremely Cold,,,,,
,1167,We Came On The Special Price Travel Zoo Deal So Were Not Surprised To Be Put In Room 5 Overlooking Roofs Although It Did Rather Make Us Feel A Little Like The Poor Relations. Maybe It Would Be Sensible To Tell Folks On Special Price Deals That This Will Be The Case.,,,,,
,1169,We Were In Kitty Jay Lodge Which Was Excellent - See Above,,,,,
,1173,Very Happy With Them,,,,,
,1175,We Were Given An Upgrade Which We Did Not Really Want. Bedroom Was Clean And Comfortable  However  Had To Crawl Under A Table To Access A Light Socket  No Tooth-Mugs In Bathroom And One Bar Of Soap Between Two Of Us And We Had To Chase Around To Hae A Fan Installed To Cool The Room Down. Etc.Etc.,,,,,
,1180,My Wife Was Very Pleased With The Wheelchair Accessable Room.,,,,,
,1183,First Class Accomodation With Fantastic Views,,,,,
,1184,I Left A Note That I Did Not Want The Wool Blanket  That Was Great When They Removed It...But The Quilt Cover Was What I Used Over A Sheet...Without The Heavy Duvet  My Quilted Cover Had A Stain No One Ever Noticed...I Used It As A Blanket Anyway...It Did Bother Me Each Night It Would Often Be Folded Up On The Floor Vs On Tope The Wardrobe...I Used It Off The Floor...Guess This Left An Odd Sense Of Service For Me...I Did Not Call Down Or Such About It.,,,,,
,1185,No Mobile Phone Coverage. Room Was Ok  But Was It 5Star? Just Maybe. Tv Didn't Work Properly - Manged One Channel.,,,,,
,1189,Donna Gave Us An Upgrade Which Was To A Lovely Room Which Certainly Will Make Us Consider Upgrading Ourselves In Future,,,,,
,1191,I Was Very Disappointed To Find The Fridge Had Disappeared As I Particularly Dislike The Uht Milk In The Plastic Blobs.  It Had A Cheapening Effect As Far As I Was Concerned  Not Really Befitting A Hotel Of Your Standard.,,,,,
,1194,The Stool At The End Of The Bed Was Covered In Stains As Was The Carpet. The One Single Blanket Was A Disgrace. There Was Paint Off The Skirting  The Cornice Was Stained In One Area. It Was Impossible To Read With The 25 Watt Light Bulbs  My Request For Brighter Ones Was Ignored. The Beds Were Incredibly Hard But Then I Suppose 75% Of Your Guests Are Obese.,,,,,
,1196,Thank You - We Love Room 4!,,,,,
,1198,Please See Comments In Question 6. Above.,,,,,
,1201,The Lodge Was Good. Great Facilities  Clean  Full Of Light And Space. Two Quibbles. There Were No Cushions To Our Outside Chairs. Secondly The Living Room Furniture Whilst Fitting The Design And Looking Terrific Was Incredibly Uncomfortable To Sit On.,,,,,
,1202,We Were Upgraded On Arrival; No Explanation Was Given But Happy About That Anyway.  The Bedroom Was Lovely But There Was Peeling Paint On The Window Sills And The Condensation In The Bathroom Overnight Was Quite Bad But This Did Not Ruin Our Stay.,,,,,
,1203,Room 3 Fantastic  Room 9 Adequate.  No View,,,,,
,1206,The Lighting In The Room And Bathroom Would Be Improved Through The Fitting Lights In Ceiling.  A Glass Could Be Provided For Toothbrush And Toothpaste In The Bathroom,,,,,
,1208,The Bedroom And Bathroom Were Quite Tired,,,,,
,1209,Thank You To Whomever Arranged My Last Bedroom!  I Loved It!  Thank You  Bovey Staff For All Your Caring And Kindness!,,,,,
,1214,Room Was Badly In Need Of Re-Decoration,,,,,
,1215,The Lighting In The Bathroom Is To Low. Add More Lights. The Towels Smell Of Peat?,,,,,
,1216,We Prefer A Firmer Matress But Understand You Can't Be Changing Matresses For Every Guest.,,,,,
,1217,Great  Except The Noise Of The Lift,,,,,
,1219,There Were A Few Things Such As A Stained Pillowcase And Stains On The Walls But All In All The Room Was Lovely  The View Was Spectacular,,,,,
,1221,Safe Didnt Work.,,,,,
,1224,Slightly Odd Smell In Room,,,,,
,1225,The Water In The Bath Did Not Drain Away Very Quickly And There Were Damp Patches In The Bedroom. We Stayed In Room 42.,,,,,
,1226,An Excellent Large Room  With All Immeneties. One Slight Discomforting Factor Were The Two Beds Were Joined Together So In The Middle Was Uneven And A Little Uncomfortable.,,,,,
,1227,We Stayed At Rose Cottage (Room 59) And It Was Superb  The Only Comment Is A Mirror In The Bedroom (The One Overlooking The Road Outside The Gates) Would Be A Great Addition Perhaps,,,,,
,1228,Just Wonderful,,,,,
,1229,Bedroom Carpets Were Stained And The Whole Decor Looked A Bit Tired. In My Opinion  The Room Could Do With A Cosmetic Upgrade.,,,,,
,1230,Room 45 Bathroom Is A Bit Shabby With Evidence Of Damp And Patched-Up Wallpaper.  Surprised That The Hotel Is Charging For Wi-Fi  That's A Bit Out Of Touch And Unnecessary With The Room Rates Being What They Are.  Tv Channels Are A Bit Limited And The Remote Control/Tv Interface Is Very Confusing And Arbitrary.  How To Use It Guide Would Be Welcome.  Also Surprised That No Hotel Information Pack Was Available In The Room.,,,,,
,1233,Having To Pay Extra For Wifi Is Unresonable,,,,,
,1236,We Were In Room 26 For The Nights Of 16 And 17 March And Enjoyed The Spectacular View  The Fact That It Faced South; And The Comfort And Care With Which Everything Had Been Prepared.  Our 3 Sons Had Booked Us Into Bovey Castle As Part Of A Magical Mystery Tour Which They Organised For Our Special Birthdays.  We Could Not Have Asked For More From You. (Our Son  Simon Thomson  Had Previously Stayed With You And Spoke In Glowing Terms Of Your Hospitality Etc.),,,,,
,1237,The Bathroom Was Slightly Tatty In Places And Needed Some Treatment. Otherwise The Room Was Very Pleasing.,,,,,
,1238,The Display Beverage Box Was Broken - The Cross Straps Which Held The Cups And Saucers Had Broken Off And It Was The First Thing We Did - Make A Cup Of Tea - So That Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,1241,Beautiful - We Loved It. Immaculately Kept And Very Well Stocked.,,,,,
,1242,Slightly Cold.,,,,,
,1243,We Booked Last Minute And I Guess There Wasn't Many Rooms Left So Our Room Was Small And The Bathroom Didn't Match  In My Opinion  The Bathroom Of A 5 Star Plus Hotel. (Which I Feel You Are On All Other Levels) So That Was Dissapointing But We Have Stayed Before And Had Nicer Bathrooms So Maybe We Were In An Older Room.,,,,,
,1245,Room 60 Needs A Safe Fitted. The New Tv's Require Their 'Stand-By' Button To Be Programmed On The Remote Control. The Wall Between Rooms 60 And 57 Is Very Thin And Conversations Can Be Heard!,,,,,
,1246,Lodge Was Fabulous Everything In Excellent And So Well Equipped,,,,,
,1247,First Basic Room Was Very Small But We Took The Valley Castle Room Later  Which Was Good In Size And Had A Nice View.,,,,,
,1248,Would Have Been Nice To Have Your Slippers In The Bedroom,,,,,
,1249,Milk In The Fridge Went Off - And The Replacement We Requested Also Was Bad On Arrival - Shame That  It Also Took A Long Time To Get The Problem With The Milk Sorted - It Took 2 Or 3 Calls - One To Housekeeping (Not Answered)  One To Reception (Who Said They'd Report It To Housekeeping)  And One Further Call Back To Housekeeping After Nothing Had Happened For Quite A While.  Bed Comfortable Room Tended To Get Hot At Night  So We Tried To Leave The Windows And Curtains Open Staff Sometimes Closed These As Part Of Turn Down Service ,,,,,
,1252,Only Tiny Thing Missing Was A Hand Towel Hung Next To Sink In Ensuite. Not A Big Deal But Would Have Perfected The Bathroom.,,,,,
,1253,The Original Allocation To Room 22 Was A Little Dismal With Paint Crumbling Off Windows And Generally Dowdy,,,,,
,1256,The Room Was Very Good Indeed  The View In Particular Was Fantastic  But The Bed Was Slightly Too Soft For My Tastes.  Also Whilst The Wifi Signal Was Good  The Internet Access Itself Was Intermittent.,,,,,
,1257,A Lighter Duvet Needed For The Summer.,,,,,
,1258,Only Negative Was The Strong Odour Of Grease On Sunday Night,,,,,
,1259,Would Have Liked The Option Of A Bath As Well As A Shower.,,,,,
,1260,At Night I Could Hear Some Noise Made By The Main Door (Loose Door When Closed).,,,,,
,1261,The Room Was Comfortable But Not Overly Big I Felt The Bathroom Wasn't Really 5 Star Standard It Was All Clean And Perfectly Usable Though,,,,,
,1262,The Bathrooms Are Looking Slightly Tired,,,,,
,1263,The Classic Room We Were First Put In Was Next To Either The Boiler House Or The Kitchen. The Constant Noise Was Not Condusive To Relaxing Especially Trying To Recover From Jetlag. We Asked To Be Moved And Were Moved With No Hassle Or Delay Which Was Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,1264,2 Things:   Internet: Make Sure That You Explain In The Instructions That An 'Internet Explorer' Browser Is Required To Access The Log On Page. Many People  Like Myself  Use Chrome Or Firefox These Days.   Pillows: Bit Synthetic  Makes Me A Little Hot (Not In A Good Way!),,,,,
,1265,All We Can Say ..... It Was Brilliant,,,,,
,1267,I Could Only Access The Internet By Calling Reception To Get A Code. Bit Of A Pain As It Would Recognise My Room Number And Surname,,,,,
,1271,Personal Opinion Is That The Room Was Very Warm  A Lower Tog Duvet Would Help But As I Say This Is My Personal Opinion And Many Others May Not Agree  Not Something I Would Hold Against Bovey Castle! I Never Looked To See If Central Heating Could Be Controlled So My Fault!,,,,,
,1272,Loved The Turn-Down Service,,,,,
,1273,Bathroom Starting To Look In Need Of A Refresh,,,,,
,1274,Very Comfortable. Maybe A Bit Hot,,,,,
,1276,Room Was Cosy And In Character With Hotel. Shower Screen Didn't Fit Over Bath So Leaked Water On Floor. Rm 30.,,,,,
,1277,Internet Was Very Slow,,,,,
,1278,I Was Disappointed To Find There Was A Charge For Wireless Internet.  In A Luxury Hoyel This Service Should Be Standard,,,,,
,1280,Our Bedroom Was Spacious And Clean And The Shower Was Nice And Powerful And The Temperature Did Not Fluctuate At All. Our Only Slightly Negative Comment Was We Did Not Have Any View Of The Beautiful Surroundings And Had We Been Staying More Than One Night This Would Have Been More Of A Bugbear  However This Was More Than Made Up By The Rest Of The Hotel Facilities.,,,,,
,1281,There Was No Shampoo  Conditioner Or Shower Gel In The Room  And I Had Been Relying On This.  The Mattress Was Extremly Comfortable  But Our King Size Bed Had Only A Double Size Duvet Inside  A King Size Duvet Cover. This Made Sleeping In The Bed Uncomfortable And Chilly,,,,,
,1283,We Have Stayed In Many Hotels And This Was By Far The Best Suit We Have Ever Stayed In. The Bathroom Was Spectacular! Room 50 Is Perfect For A Family. The Only Helpful Addition Would Be Door Stops For The Internal Doors (Although I Understand You May Not Be Able To Do This) . While We Appreciate The Need For Fire Doors  They Are A Little Dangerous For Little Fingers And As A Family We Like To Have Our Doors Open.,,,,,
,1285,We Stayed In Room 48 Which Was Lovely I Made Just A Few Observations If The Room That May Need  Updating There Is Damage To The Wall Paper In Bathroom Normal Wear And Tear By Shower And By Mirror. The Tea Storage Box Was Damaged. The Seat At The End Of Bed Was Marked With What Looked Like  Tea Stain.,,,,,
,1286,Internet Access Was Intermittent And Mobile Signal Non Existant,,,,,
,1287,Tv Wasn't Working  Or If It Was Could Not Turn It On Needs An 'How To Use' Card.Needed One Extra Soap In The Bathroom. Found The Coffee And Tea But Not Sure If There Was A Kettle.? Again Needs A Descriptive Card.,,,,,
,1288,I Felt The Bedroom Let The Hotel Down  It Was Slightly Old Fashioned But That Of Course Is Just Taste. I Found The Room A Bit Too Dark And There Was An Area Where Mould Was Coming Through. The En-Suite Was Also A Little Dated And Very Basic.,,,,,
,1289,Beautiful! Very Cosy But Still A Large Room. I Have Stayed In Hundreds Of Hotels All Over The World But Yours Has Got To Be My Favourite So Far.,,,,,
,1290,Showers Went Cold One Evening.  Apparently This Is A Problem In The Lodges.  We Were Only A Family Of 4 That All Took Showers At The Same Time Which Is Generally The Case When Changing After A Day For Dinner.,,,,,
,1291,Overall It Was A Great Exoperience,,,,,
,1292,Room 41- Overall Quite Nice But Was Next To Lift And Opposite A Service Room So Lots Of Regular Door Banging. Bathroom A Bit Average  Bath Panel Very Tired  Toilet Seat Won't Stay Up Due To Flush Handle  Towel Rail Didn't Seem To Heat Up Regardless Of Turning The Dial Up Or Down.,,,,,
,1293,Was Disturbed In The Early Hours Of The Morning By Bottles Being Placed In A Bin.,,,,,
,1294,There Were Two Minor Problems With The Room - Bathroom Radiator Made The Bathroom Unbearably Hot At Night  And One Side Of The Bed Was A Bit Lop Sided And Hence Sleep Was A Little Disturbed.,,,,,
,1295,Wifi,,,,,
,1296,The Wardrobe Door In Room 32 Was Tricky To Close  And The Bolts Did Not Always Hold.,,,,,
,1297,The Free Wi-Fi Is A Bit Of A Faff To Keep Re-Connecting To,,,,,
,1299,The View From Our Room Was Beautiful. There Could Have Been More Shower Gel Provided In The Bathroom,,,,,
,1300,The Bathroom Requires Attention  The Tiling Not In Keeping With The Decor Plus The Shower Screen Ill Fitting  Water Escapes Resulting In Peeling Paint To The Bath Panel Which Looks Tired And Not What You Would Expect From The  Standard Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,1301,I Would Like To Know The Make And Grade Of The Matress In Room 4 As It Was The Most Comfiortable Bed I Have Ever Slept In. Pillows A Bit Flat.,,,,,
,1303,See Earlier Comments.....I Put Them In The Wrong Place.B,,,,,
,1304,For 'Constructive Criticism Only' And Not Complaining - We Stayed In The Cathedral Room And The Seat At The End Of The Bed Had Stains On It So We Just Put Blanket Over It That Was On The Bed  This Was Not An Issue To Us But To Someone Else It May Be An Issue And A Cause To Complain!  We Were Really Happy With The Room Very Comfortable  Homely And Spacious  Really Happy With Being Given The Choice Of Upgrading From Room 42.,,,,,
,1306,A Stool Or Bathroom Chair Would Be A Nice Addition To The Bathroom,,,,,
,1308,It Was A Little Tired Looking And The Bathroom Floor Was Stained  But Overall Very Acceptable,,,,,
,1310,I Would Be Looking To Change The Carpets In The Lodge Soon And Maybe Go For A Darker Colour For People Who Don't Take Their Shoes Off When They Get Into The Lodge.,,,,,
,1311,In The 'Guide' It Would Have Been Useful To Have A 'Map' Of The Hotel Showing Where The Pool/Edwarian Grill/Bistro Etc Were Located,,,,,
,1313,Fantastic !!,,,,,
,1314,We Needed To Change Rooms A Few Times Due To Noise  But Finally Ended Up In A Very Comfortable And Quiet Lodge.,,,,,
,1320,The Room Was Not Cleaned Well. The Cushions On The Bed And The Bed Skirt Were Heavily Stained. The Sound Proofing Was Very Poor  Even For An Old Building. The Rooms Are Small And The Barrooms Basic  So The Quality Of Furniture And Touches Like The Cleaning Need To Be Much  Much Better.,,,,,
,1322,The Lodge Was Absolutely Fabulous And Lived Up To Our Very High Expectations,,,,,
,1323,Fantastic Room Great Views Thank You!!,,,,,
,1324,No Satnav Provided To Get Round The Large Bed! Lol,,,,,
,1329,Lovely.... The Milk In The Fridge Was Sour Although Within Date ,,,,,
,1332,Stayed In A State Room. Mould In Bathroom And On Blind  Disappointed As Cost Of Room High Expected Higher Standards,,,,,
,1337,Beautiful Rooms And Saw Quite A Few As Wedding Guests Had Them,,,,,
,1339,Some Of The Flowers In Room Were Dead And Not. Changed For The Few Days We Were There,,,,,
,1341,Room 14/En Suite Is Looking A Little Tired In Places.,,,,,
,1342,I Felt The Bedroom Could Have Been A Little Bit Nicely Decorated!!,,,,,
,1343,Room In Eve And Early Morning Was A Little Noisy Overlooking The Courtyard.  Given It Was Very Warm It Was Necessary To Have The Window Open During Occupancy.  It Was A Very Hot Room Which We Found Difficult To Cool.,,,,,
,1346,Did Not Like Being Near To The Bistro  But Room Very Light And Spacious And Loved The View Over The Terrace,,,,,
,1349,Only Issue That We Had There Was No Milk For Tea/Coffee This Was Rectified Straight Away After Making A Call To Reception.,,,,,
,1350,We Upgraded To A Valley View As Our Allocated Classic Room Was Very Small. Room 26 Was Lovely Would Request It Again.,,,,,
,1352,The Room Was Situated Above What Seemed A Busy Route Taken By The Staff On Various Vehicles. But  This Was A Minor Bug Which Did Not Really Bother Us Too Much. If It Was Deemed To Be Too Much  We Would Have Asked To Be Moved. So  No Big Deal.,,,,,
,1353,It Was Very Tasteful  Clean And Comfortable.,,,,,
,1357,Was Slightly Concerned At The Colour Of The Water It Appeared To Be Yellow In Colour  It Was Clearly Noticable Once The Bath Was Filled.,,,,,
,1360,The Lodge Was Perfect For Us And The Children Loved Having The Freedom Of It.,,,,,
,1361,There Were Three Problems Which We Reported To Reception / Hotel Manager: 1) Slamming Doors - The Noise Permeated The Room And Meant That We Were Unable To Relax After Spa Treatments 2) Vibrating Sound - Occasionally There Was An Extended Period Of Vibration Like The Spin Cycle Of A Washing Machine; Hotel Manager Was Investigating The Problem As We Left 3) Stained Bedspread - On Both Sides; Removed On The First Day And Not Seen Again.,,,,,
,1362,Initial Room Offered Was On The Small Side  And Not In Keeping With A Five Star Room.  However For A Small Fee We Were Able To Upgrade To A Valley View Room  Which Was Fantastic.,,,,,
,1363,Not Enough Plug Sockets And Only One Available Was Difficult To Reach Under The Table.,,,,,
,1364,Beautiful Room & Immaculate,,,,,
,1365,We Stayed In Room 8 Which Was Lovely With Exceptional Views.  The Bathroom Could Do With A Little Tlc For A 5* Though.,,,,,
,1366,Last Time We Stayed We Had A Room That Looked Out Over The Gardens. This Time Our Room Looked Out Over The Entrance Of The Hotel. When We Went To Bed The Noise From The Disco Of The Wedding In The Cathedral Room Was Really Noticeable And Also The Noise From The Reception Area When Guests Were Returning Late In The Night To Go Back To Their Rooms Could Be Heard Within Our Room. I Think When We Book Next Time I Will Definitely Request A Room Looking Out Over The Gardens Again As They Appear To Be Quieter.,,,,,
,1367,We Had A Fan Outside Our Room Room 35  Which Woke Me At 6;15 And I Was Unable To Sleep Afterwards.  I Noticed It On Entering The Room. My Husband Was Not Bothered By It At All.  We Were Offered To Change Rooms On Arrival But I Was Tired After Our Journey From London So Declined. The Staff Could Not Have Been Nicer About It. I Loved The Character And Period Feel Of The Rooms And Building And Styling And Finishing Touches Were Very Much To My Taste  They Delighted Me!,,,,,
,1369,The Welcome Pack Was A Pleasant Surprise. The Lodge Was Very Warm And Welcoming.,,,,,
,1370,The Sleeping/Living Area Was Lovely. The Bathroom Was A Bit Disappointing.,,,,,
,1372,Increase The Room Cost And Stop Charging For Fast Internet,,,,,
,1374,We Had To Plug The Kettle In Under The Desk On The Floor Because The Lead Was Too Short For Any Other Socket.  This Made It A Little Awkward When Making Tea  And It Was Also A Potential Health And Safety Risk Due To The Very Close Proximity Of The Kettle Full Of Water To The Socket.,,,,,
,1375,The Tv Kept Going In And Out Of Signal,,,,,
,1376,Room 11 Itself Was Great. The Air Conditioning Unit Or Cooling Unit Outside Window On Television Side Was Noisy  Possibly Could Be Turned Off At Night. Did Not Sleep Well Due To This.  ,,,,,
,1378,Very Clean And Comfy With A Stunning View,,,,,
,1379,The Carpet Was Stained. The Bathroom Tiles Were Tatty & Some Did Not Match Around The Bath And There Was A Loose Tap. There Were Only 2 Teabags Of Each Type  Only Enough To Make 1 Cup Each In The Morning - A Bit Mean!,,,,,
,1381,We Stayed Over Christmas  On Christmas Eve Our Children Were Thrilled To Find A Christmas Tree Along With Decorations Had Been Placed In Our Room. It Was Great That Our Children Could Decorate The Tree Ready For Chirstmas Morning.  Excellent,,,,,
,1382,The Bedroom Was Very Warm And I Did Turn The Radiator Down But The Room Remained Too Warm,,,,,
,1383,Stunning!!,,,,,
,1384,Didn't Sleep Well- Temperature Was Too Warm And Couldn't Control It Easily,,,,,
,1385,There Was Dust Along The Curtain Pole.,,,,,
,1388,We Were Very Impressed With Our State Room And Wished We Could Have Stayed Longer ,,,,,
,1389,It Was Lovely And Comfortable  It Felt Like A Home I Would Love To Have.,,,,,
,1390,Stayed In Room 6 Bovey  Wallpaper Marked In Bedroom And Bathroom.  Bathroom Could Be Updated With Separate Shower.  Door Locks Damaged  However The View Was Wonderful,,,,,
,1393,Accessibility A Bit Of A Problem!  No Problem When Walking The Dog - But When In High Heels Coming For Lunch And Dinner..................!,,,,,
,1396,Difficulties With Phone Reception,,,,,
,1397,Very Warm Room - Unable To Regulate Temperature In Room,,,,,
,1405,I Only Discovered That The Full Length Bathroom Window Was Not Frosted Until After I Had Used The Toilet Several Times.,,,,,
,1412,Very Good It Would Be Nice To Have High Speed Internet For The Decerning Customer! You Would!?,,,,,
,1413,Would Have Liked Comfortable Chairs To Relax Ie Armchairs,,,,,
,1414,Both The Bedroom & Bathroom Were Very Comfortable. However The Lighting In The Lobby Area Between The Bedroom & Bathroom Was Inadequate To See When Place Clothing To The Large Wardrobe !!,,,,,
,1415,A Couple Of Little Points Could Have Been Improved On - Such As A Few Stains On The Blankets And Chipped China - But These Are Only Small Details!  It Also Seemed A Little Odd That You Are Expected To Pay For Internet In A Five-Star Establishment. Otherwise The Room Was Perfect!,,,,,
,1418,The First Room Allocated Was Near The Lift But We Were Allowed To Change Rooms With A Good Grace & No Fuss.,,,,,
,1419,We Stayed In A Lodge. I Was Disappointed The Wine Glasses Were All Different Sizes. There Were Only 4 Glass Tumblers (For 6 Guests) And Not Enough Dessert Spoons Or Tea Spoons. I Had To Ask For A Can Opener To Be Provided And There Were No Kitchen Scissors. There Were Four Cushions For 6 Patio Chairs.  The Patio Furniture Was In Desperate Need Of Some Teak-Oil.,,,,,
,1420,Wi-Fi Should Be For Free.,,,,,
,1421,The Rooms Were Slightly Warmer Due To The Summer Heat  Which Made Some Of The Guests Slightly Uncomfortable.,,,,,
,1423,One Of The Finest Experiences We Have Had.  I Could Not Fault It.,,,,,
,1424,Room Was Fairly Small And Decor Was Not What I Was Expecting - Very Modern,,,,,
,1426,We Were Grateful To Have Two Doors To Our Room As The Noise From Children Passing In The Corridor Was Loud  And If We Would Have Only Had One Door I Think It Would Have Been Unbearable.,,,,,
,1427,Lovely Touches Eg The Fudge  Fresh Milk Excellent Selection Of Teas.  Wonderful Bed Linen And One Of The Most Comfortable Beds I Have Ever Slept In.,,,,,
,1428,We Stayed In Room 34 Which Had A Lovely Outlook Over The Beautiful Grounds  The Room Was Well Laid Out And Had A Large Dressing Room Which Was Great. The Bathroom Was Adequate Although The Cold Bath Tap Was Loose And A Cheap Broken Plastic Soap Holder Was Not . A Fridge To Chill The Water And Compliment The Tea Making By Enabling Fresh Milk To Be Available. Other Than These Minor Points We Loved The Room.,,,,,
,1429,The Lodges Are Excellent But Have One Small Drawback In That Noise Travels Easily From Bottom To Top.,,,,,
,1430,No Fresh Milk   If Available On Request We Weren't Aware And Whether There Would Be A Cost   Maybe In The Room Notes / Brochure.,,,,,
,1432,We Found It Was Lovely,,,,,
,1433,Everything In Our Room Was Great Except The Internet Access Was Extremely Slow.,,,,,
,1434,It Was Over Looking Some Roof Tops And That's All You Could See. As I Had Previously Stated When Booking That Was For My 30Th Birthday And I Thought This Would Have Been Taken Into Account So I Was Not Given Such A Terrible View.,,,,,
,1435,Unreasonably High Charges To Use The Phone In The Lodge - You Should Consider Lowering These Given That There Is No Mobile Reception Anywhere!,,,,,
,1436,We Were In A Room On The Second Floor  ( Possibly Due To The Fact That We Made A Late Booking As Hotel Was Very Busy) It Was Not Quite As Nice As We Have Had Before And The Corridor And Carpet On The Back Staircase Felt Very Worn And Shabby Looking.,,,,,
,1437,I Was Not Completely Clear About Wifi. The Information In The Room Was Different To When You Tried To Log Onto Wifi From A Device In Room.,,,,,
,1439,Internet Was Very Slow.,,,,,
,1443,Very Comfortable  Amazing Bathroom  And Wonderful View,,,,,
,1444,Toilet Roll Allowed To Run Out And Not Replace- Bit Embarrassing To Have To Ask Reception To Resolve! Internet Connection Had To Be Reset Couple Of Times During Our Stay As Ip Address Not Available. Love The Fresh Milk In Fridge In Room.,,,,,
,1446,Light And Airy. Privacy Respected.,,,,,
,1447,The Bathroom Was A Bit Tired In Decorating Terms.,,,,,
,1448,We Have Been Staying In Both The Suite And The Lodge. We Have Much Apreciated Both.,,,,,
,1451,We Did Find The Bath Disappointing As It Is Relatively Small And Narrow For Such A Nice Room. Didn't Like The Flooring In The Bathroom Either.,,,,,
,1452,Lovely View Of The Rear Gardens.,,,,,
,1453,Beautiful Decor And Very Comfortable,,,,,
,1454,The Wi-Fi Connection In The Room Was A Little Intermittent.,,,,,
,1455,It Was Simply Lovely,,,,,
,1457,The Room Was Spacious.  Tv/Radio Limited Channels.  I Think Internet Access Should Really Be Free Of Charge In This Day And Age,,,,,
,1460,Wasn't The Room With A Valley View As Requested But Was Still Excellent.,,,,,
,1462,Lovely Suite  Felt Very Special,,,,,
,1463,We Had An Issue With The Smoke Alarm Disturbing My Wifes Sleep.,,,,,
,1464,The Bed Was So Comfortable! Probably The Most Comfortable Bed We've Ever Slept In.   Lovely Tea And Coffee Provided.  Everything We Needed Was In The Room.  We Did Try To Watch Something On The I-Player But It Kept Stopping So We Gave Up - I Expect The Internet Connection Was Too Slow. That Wasn't A Problem Though As We Were Keen To Go And Have A Drink In The Bar And Use The Pool. The Shower Was Nice And Powerful. The Only Thing I Would Say About The Bathroom Is The Window Had A Bit Of A Condensation Problem And There Was A Large Puddle Of Water On The Windowsill In The Morning.,,,,,
,1465,We Feel That Wifi Really Should Be Free. Also Hotels In Europe All Have Nespresso Machines In The Rooms - So Much Better Than Instant Coffee!,,,,,
,1466,Beautiful Room With A Beautiful View,,,,,
,1468,Lighting In Bathroom Could Have Been Softer,,,,,
,1470,Women Need A Shower They Could Hold In Their Hand.,,,,,
,1472,Very Disappointed That Wifi Was Not Only Chargeable But Limited To 2 Devices. Also  The Seating In The Lounge Area Is Uncomfortable.,,,,,
,1473,On Deciding To Stay Another Night At The Last Minute We Had To Change Rooms  This Was Not A Problem As We Rather Like Seeing Other Rooms...The Move Was Conducted With Great Efficiency By The Staff While We Were Out For The Day...Excellent!,,,,,
,1475,The First Room We Stayed In (11) Was Overlooking The Kitchen Area I Believe  The Noise From The Unit Outside Was A Bit Annoying And Maybe People Should Be Warned Of This.,,,,,
,1476,The Internet Was Quite Slow In Comparison With Similar Properties But When On Holiday It's Not A Major Issue. We Stayed In A Castle Valley Room (48) And Although The Bedroom Had Potential To Be Extremely Nice There Were A Number Of Issues Such As Damp On The Walls  Marks On The Carpet And Due To The Damp Conditions The Windows Had Condensation Which Restricted The View.,,,,,
,1477,It Was Outstanding,,,,,
,1478,Update Decor And Bed.Living Room Tv So Small And And So Little Channels Working,,,,,
,1479,The Bathroom Would Have Been Much More Appealing If It Had A Free Standing Bath  As It Had The Room. Also  The Water From The Bath Tap Ran A Strange Yellow/Green Colour,,,,,
,1480,Decor Getting Slightly Tired,,,,,
,1482,Could Not Connect Ipad To Tv And Limited Access To Tv Channels.,,,,,
,1483,We Were In Room 21  It Was Lovely However Far Too Hot Overnight  Was This Because The Room Below Had Log Fire Burning?,,,,,
,1485,I Requested A Room Move After Night 1 Due To No Sleep At All Due To Knocking Pipes In The Room.  However The Room We Received For Day 2 Was Excellent And Very Quiet.,,,,,
,1486,Stayed In A Cottage - Not The Hotel,,,,,
,1488,We Stayed In A Superior Castle Room  It Was Immaculately Clean  Spacious  Well Equipped And Had Everything That We Required........ Very Nice.,,,,,
,1490,It Was Ideal For A Family And Even Better That The Kids Had Their Own Room.It Just Couldnt Be Bettered In Our Opinion,,,,,
,1491,The Lodges Were Very Warm And Could Do With Air Conditioning,,,,,
,1492,Really Liked The Quirky Style Of The Room (Room 38). My Son Was Very Excited To Have His Own Room Although He Would Have Loved His Own Tv As Well! It Would Have Been Great To Use The 'Secret Staircase' But Due To 'Health And Safety' I Can Understand Why It Was Locked Up. A Door Wedge Would Have Been Handy Between The Bedroom And Hallway As It Was Hard To Hear If Anyone Knocked On The Door Or Called From The Bathroom.,,,,,
,1493,Lodges Are Looking Tired Now (We Have Stayed Several Times) And Need Updating,,,,,
,1501,Superb View  A Very Comfortable Bed. The Room Was Warm But It Was Lovely To Have The Windows Open And Breathe Fresh Air.,,,,,
,1502,I Do Strongly Believe That In This Day And Age  To Charge For Internet Access Is Not Reasonable.,,,,,
,1503,2 Bulbs Out On First Night,,,,,
,1504,Lovely Room With Views Over The Valley We Were Expecting !,,,,,
,1505,The Heating System Within The Lodge Did Not Work Correctly During Our Stay. As A Result The Lounge /Bedroom Areas Were Too Warm Untill We Turned The Radiators Down. The Hot Water Was Dangerously Hot For Children Or Elderly People.,,,,,
,1507,Loved The Tea And Coffee Facilities  Bed Was Extremely Comfortable,,,,,
,1508,Please Pay More Attention To Cleaning The Room.,,,,,
,1511,No Internet Access In Lodge Which I Think There Really Should Be. The Duvets Were Not Of A High Quality That I Would Have Expected But These Are Not Major Issues But Thought I Should Mention Them Anyway.,,,,,
,1513,On Our First Day (Of Four) The Turn Down Service Broke Our Blind In Our Bathroom.  It Was Never Fixed During Our Stay.  Room 50,,,,,
,1515,We Stayed In A Lodge (Haytor). The Tv In The Lounge Is Far Too Small For The Room. You Need Binoculars!,,,,,
,1517,Lovely Room With Enouogh Space For Our Dog.,,,,,
,1518,We Have Stayed In The Classic  Castle And Lodge In The Past So We Knew What To Expect,,,,,
,1521,The Bed Was The Most Comfortable Of All The Hotels I Have Stayed In! Would Have Liked Tumblers In The Bathroom For Use Of Water  Rather Than Using The Glasses From The Room.,,,,,
,1523,Excellent - Standard Of Cleaness Very High  Very Impressed. Only One Downer - No Light In The Tea/Coffee Making Area Making It Quite Difficult To See What We Were Doing. Very Comfortable Beds And Loved The Duet And Pillows,,,,,
,1527,Only Place To Plug In Kettle Is On The Foor By The Door ( Health And Safety Issue As Door Leads To Bathroom. Need Bell As You Cannot Hear Anyone Knocking,,,,,
,1530, A Choice Of Pillow Firmness/Softness Would Have Been Appreciated  But Otherwise Excellent.,,,,,
,1531,Personally I Was A Little Disappointed With The Ambiance Of The Room From My Expectations Following The Build Up I Had From Friends Who Have Visited And Staff. I Know This Was A Kind Donation By You To The Radio Devon Appeal And I Do Thank You For That.,,,,,
,1536,A Bit Dated Needed Updating ( Bathroom),,,,,
,1537,Couldn't Comment On Toiletries As We Were There With Helpful Holidays And They Aren't Provided But We Knew That In Advance So It Wasn't A Problem.,,,,,
,1539,The Lodge Was Warm And Welcoming. The Beds Were Very Comfortable And There Was Plenty Of Hot Water. The Carpets Obviously Take A Lot Of Wear And Tear So Are Looking A Bit Stained Now.,,,,,
,1542,Felt That The Bathroom Was Not As Luxurious As Expected. Bath Ok Grouting Surrounding Bath Poor.,,,,,
,1544,We Booked A Deluxe Double Room  But The Bed Was Two Singles Pushed Together.,,,,,
,1547,The First Night Was Noisy From Guests Slamming Car Doors And Talking Loudly; Our Room Was Above Reception Facing The Car Park.  The Second Night Was Much Better.,,,,,
,1550,We Found Our Bedroom Slightly Small  And Claustrauphobic - Not Enough Room For Our Clothes (Admittedly We May Have Packed More Than We Could Use In The Three Day Period!) But Having Booked Reasonably Early We Would Have Thought That We Would Have Been Allocated A Better Room.  However Once We Reluctantly Brought This To The Managers Attention We Were Moved Into An Extremely Comfortable Room Which Enhanced Our Stay For The Last Two Days.,,,,,
,1551,Very Nice Room (36) Very Confortable Bed And Excellent Facilities  An Ironing Board May Have Been Useful Though.,,,,,
,1552,We Were Very Pleased That The Hotel Had Catered For Our Young Daughter.  It Is The First Time We Have Received A Third Tea Cup And Glass Without Having To Call Room Service.  Something So Simple  3 In A Room So Three Of Everything.  You Realy Made Her Stay By Providing Small Slippers And A Small Dressing Gown  Excellent.  Due To Bad Condensation In The Bathroom The Toilet Roll Got Very Wet From The Water From The Window Pouring Down The Wall.  Must Happen A Lot As The Blind Was Water Marked/Stained.  Otherwise We Could Not Fault The Room.,,,,,
,1553,It Would Be Useful To Have Free And Easy To Use Wifi Access  As There Are No Mobile Telephone Signals In The Locality Making It Difficult Pick Up Emails.,,,,,
,1557,The Room - No 52 - Was Lovely And Spacious With A Great View  Beautifully Done And Set Out  With Thoughtful Touches,,,,,
,1558,Best Hotel Bed I Ever Stayed In,,,,,
,1559,The Room Had A Leak Through The Window Frame  We Were Up-Graded To Another Room By The Manager. Very Happy With The Service Provided.,,,,,
,1560,Room 62 Is Terrible With Paper Pealing Antiquated Furniture And Bathroom That Needs Overhauling! Without A/C And Poor Windows's It Was Far Too Warm. The View Is Horrendous When Considering The Beautiful Scenery And Obviously The Entire Establishment Requires Modernisation. We Booked Via Travelzoo And This Is The First Time That Our Experience With Facilities And Overall Trip Was Bad.   The Staff Are Superb And Professional,,,,,
,1562,Clean Warm Small Issue Housekeeping Forgot To Replenish Milk,,,,,
,1564,Would Have Liked A Garden View Room After All I Have Stayed With For Approx.7 Nights In The Past Month,,,,,
,1565,The Lack Of Mirror Near An Electic Socket Made It Difficult To Style Hair With Either A Hairdryer Or Straigteners. It Was Also Difficult To Apply Makeup As There Was No Mirror Near A 'Dressing Table' Or Desk.  There Was Insufficient Lighting On The Desk For Working. The Lack Of Sockets Near The Bed Made It Difficult To Charge Mobile Phones/Ipads And Use Them As An Alarm Clock  Especially As There Was No Clock Near The Bed. I Appreciate That For Holiday Clients They May Not Want A Clock Near The Bed But For Business Clients This Is Essential As They Have Time Constraints  Morning Meetings Etc.  The Bed Was A Little Soft For My Taste And The Room Was Too Warm.,,,,,
,1567,Would Have Been Lovely To Have Had Softer Pillows  But Thats All As Everything Else Perfect.,,,,,
,1569,The Suite Was Pretty Good Although Too Warm And Like A Lot Of The Hotel  Could Do With A Slight Bit Of Tlc - I'll Go Into More Details If I Can Later In This Survey...,,,,,
,1570,We Loved The Room And Were Quite Happy That It Was Not A Valley View Room Given It Was A 'Classic'! Mould On Teh Window Stone Mullions And Blinds Did Not Bother Us But Would Undoubtedly Upset Others And Perhaps It Is Worth Saying That Some Thought About Housekeeping / General Cleanliness Might Pay Dividends With Regard To Some More Critical Guests. We Loved The Homely  Friendly  Relaxed And Superbly Comfortable And Luxurious Surroundings Which Far Outweighed Any Carping About 'Stains On Carpets' Etc But People Will Compare Bovey To The Likes Of Gidleigh (We Did It Must Be Said). Given The Price Difference We Thought It Compared Reasonably Well But There Is A Real Difference In The General Levels Of Housekeeping / Cleanliness Overall.,,,,,
,1572,Really Nice To Have Fresh Milk Provided.,,,,,
,1573,Beautiful,,,,,
,1574,Yes  When I Visited This Time I Wanted To See The Lodge Just In Case I Decide To Come On A Family Visit In The Future  And I Was Shocked That The Price Provided Then Was Cheap Comparing To The Regular Rates And Comparing To The Rate I Got In The Castle Room  As I Was Informed It's Due To A Promotion...While If I Was Informed About It...I Would Have Been More Interested To Upgrade My Reservation Noting That I Had A Special Occaison To Celebrate During This Stay And It Would've Been Interesting To Know.,,,,,
,1575,There Was A Small Problem With The Lights And Extractor Fan In The Bathroom  But On Reporting The Problem A Member Of The Repair Team Attended Really Quickly.  Unfortunately Though Frederico The 'Ghost' Is Still There Playing With The Electricity When We Left.,,,,,
,1576,Had To Change From The Allocated Room As The Bed Was Too Small. Final Room Was Very Good.,,,,,
,1577,Very Comfortable. Lovely Views.,,,,,
,1578,A Great Suite But Needed A Little Tlc - Chipped Paint And Stains In Places,,,,,
,1579,The Arrangements For Internet Access Were Not Clear,,,,,
,1580,We Chose Bovey Castle Because It Has 5 Star Rating Having Stayed At Celtic Manor For 2 Nights Prior And Felt That The Rooms At Bovey Could Do With Upgrading That Being Said Bovey Dating Back To 1800 Hundreds It Must Be Very Hard To Maintain. We Did Upgrade Our First Room.,,,,,
,1581,I Stayed In A State Room And It Was Stunning! The Only Ever So Slight Negative Was That The Milk In My Fridge Had White Bits Floating In It (It Was In Date  But Had Gone Off)  So I Couldn't Make A Cup Of Tea  But Other Than That  Perfect!,,,,,
,1585,Very Nice Very Clean Very Comfortable,,,,,
,1586,See Back,,,,,
,1589,One Or Two Things Missing From Lodge - Dustpan And Brush Would Be Useful As We Bring Our Dogs And Like To Keep The Place Tidy As We Go.  A Surface Cleaner Spray For Kitchen Worktops And Table Would Be Nice Too   So It Is Easy To Clean Up After Cooking.,,,,,
,1590,Think Lack Of Internet Connectivity In An Area With Such Poor Mobile Phone Coverage Was Unacceptable,,,,,
,1591,We Had Problem With The Toilet Flush And We Know A Maintenance Fellow Was Looking Into It But We Do Not Know If It Was Fixed As We Were Leaving That Morning.,,,,,
,1592,I Tried Hard To Find Fault  But Couldn't!  Although There As No Acohol In The Mini-Bar (?),,,,,
,1594,Fantastic!,,,,,
,1597,Full Internet Access Should Be Provided As The Mobiles Dont Work,,,,,
,1601,In Order To Sit Down At The Desk In The Room I Had To Pull A Small Side Table And Two Chairs Away From It And Closer To The Television In Order To Pull The Desk Chair Out.  There Was Plenty Of Room For Me To Sit When I Had Moved This Furniture But I Thought It Should Not Have Been Necesary For Me To Move It As There Was Plenty Of Room For It To Have Been Further Away From The Desk. I Don't Think It Is Very Good That You Have To Pay Â£1 Per Hour For Wifi.  Considering Free Wifi Is Available In Kfc It Seems A Bit Penny Pinching To Charge Guests When They Are Spending Such A Lot Of Money.,,,,,
,1603,Too Warm!,,,,,
,1604,The Milk Was Not Replaced For Tea For The Second Morning And I Could Not Find A Socket Near A Mirror For The Hair Dryer,,,,,
,1607,Please Get Phone Signal!!!!!,,,,,
,1609,Well Equipped Disabled Friendly Bathroom.,,,,,
,1610,Rather Hot,,,,,
,1613,I Was Quite Surprised With The Room That We Were Allocated As We Had Upgraded And Having Stayed At Bovey Twice Before I Thought We Would Have Had A Better Room Or View For The Price. The Car Park Was Very Noisy On The Morning Of 6Th October. Lots Of Cars Were Moved Early In The Morning. I Presume This Was Due To The Wedding That Was Taking Place. A Shame That The Guests That Were Already Staying There Weren't Considered.,,,,,
,1615,Suite Was Excellent  Only Small Thing Was Plug Didn't Work In Bath  But No Real Issue.,,,,,
,1617,Water Leaked Through The Ceiling On A Number Of Occasions  Room 23,,,,,
,1621,Shame The Bedroom Windows Were Not Lower So The View Could Be Appreciated!,,,,,
,1623,Yes Living In Lodge On Bottom Floor Bedroom Feltbunsafe If You Had To Open Door As No Guard And Anybody Could Just Work In.,,,,,
,1624,Room Was Far Too Hot  Unable To Sit And Relax Comfortably In The Room (Room 3) Mentioned This And Was Supplied A Fan But Made No Difference. Unable To Leave Windows Open As Room Is Directly Onto The Terrace/Bar Area! Shame Lovely Decor!,,,,,
,1625,We Stayed In One Of The Lodges But Everything Was To An Excellent Standard.,,,,,
,1626,The Instructions In The Handbook For How To Access The Internet Were Very Unclear. I Had To Ask My Sister  Who Is A Regular Guest  How To Do It. If Not I Would Have Had To Call Reception.,,,,,
,1628,Room Was A Bit Too Warm  Especially During The Night. Apart From That It Was Tastefully Decorated And Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,1633,Stayed In Room 9.  Considering It Was A Classic Room  We Thought It Was A Perfect Size For A One Night Stay.  Only Issue Was Condensation - The Windows Leaked At Night And Created Quite A Pool Of Water On The Window Sills Causing Our Magazines And Some Clothing To Get Very Wet.  Guessing That This Is A Common Problem As The Wallpaper Looked A Bit Mouldy Around The Windows.,,,,,
,1634,A Really Minor Point  But Perhaps Some Coat Hooks / & Or A Shoe Rack In The Entrance Area Which Is Sealed Off From The Bathroom And Bedroom Would Be Handy.,,,,,
,1638,Fabulous! Only Criticism Is The Same As All Hotels I Sty In - A Tad More Soundproofing Would Be Great.  That Said  Really Really Lovely.  Top Notch.,,,,,
,1639,Only Minor Ones.  The Tv In Our Room Was Huge  But The System To Use It Was A Bit Clunky And The Sound System Was Very Bass - So Had To Turn It Up To Hear Voices. The Tea And Coffee Area Was A Little Inconvenient On The Window  By The Tv With Wires For A Kettle.  We Were In Room 24. These Are Just Comments T Tweak.  We Had A Toliet Get Blocked And Overflow - But This Was Instantly Fixed.,,,,,
,1641,Finding A Plug Socket For The Kettle Was A Slight Issue Due To The Short Lead On The Kettle  But We Did Manage  To Use The Socket Behind The Tv And Balance.,,,,,
,1642,I Loved The Bed. Where Can We Get Such An Amazing Mattress. Please Can You Let Me Know,,,,,
,1644,Room Allocated Was Very Nice But Small.,,,,,
,1645,Once We Complained That We Had No Fridge  No Safe And Could Not Lock Our Door We Were Impressed That We Were Moved To A Superior Room. The First Room Was Not Cleaned To A High Standard And We Were Surprised To See Bare Nails Where We Guess A Picture Had Once Hung. We Still Feel The Errors Should Not Have Occurred In The First Place Once Again For A 5 Star Establishment.,,,,,
,1649,Because The Turn Down Was Refused  We Didn't Reaise He Had Stuck Do Not Disturb On Our Door Which We Did Not Want And It Meant The Engineer We Called Just Prior To Dinneer About Our Non Flushing  Completly Broken Wc Was Not Mended. Rather Took The Edge Off A Lovely Stay Especially As Check Out Staff Didn't Appear Too Bothered That We Had A Broken Wc All Night.,,,,,
,1651,Stayed In Lodge And Found That Tv Remote Control Was Missing And A Pair Of Scissors Would Be Useful In Kitchen  Overall Lodge Had Good Standard Of Decor Although Tired In Places  Wallpaper Peeling  Walls Marked  The Heating/Hot Water System Was Very Hot And Although Thermoatat Was At Lowest Level We Still Required The Doors And Windows To Be Opened To Reduce The Heat To A Comfortable Level. We Very Much Appreciated The Complementary Food  Wine  And Provisions Left In Fridge And Cupboards A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,1652,Great Views Of The Golf Course Even Though It Was A Castle Room.,,,,,
,1653,As We Were Upgraded To A State Room We Were Very Happy With Our Accommodation,,,,,
,1655,The Room Was Pretty And Small.  The Bed Was Extremely Comfortable -- But The Chairs Were For Show Only And Not Comfortable To Sit And Read In.  The Window Had Had Many Leaks And Had Paint Peeling Off The Frame And Stains On The Wallpaper.,,,,,
,1658,No,,,,,
,1660,Room 42 - Slightly Tired  Bathroom Grout Grubby  Carpet Had Stains On It In Bedroom.,,,,,
,1663,The Room Was Lovely And The Cleaning Service And Turn Down Service Were Exceptional. I Particularly Loved The Fudge We Received On One Evening!,,,,,
,1664,Internet Speed Is Extremely Slow  In Fact Not Really Usable. In Most 5* Hotels Around The World Now  Internet Access Is Part Of The Room Price. It Is Quite Old Fashioed To Still Have A Extra Charge For Internet Access. We Tried To Watch Materchef From Iplayer And The Speed Of Connection Was Too Slow. This Is One Item We Would Love To See Improved As Mobile Reception Is Also Practically Non Existent (Which Isn't A Bad Thing).,,,,,
,1667,The Bath In Room 42 Should Definitely Be Window Facing So That You Could Relax In A Hot Bath Whilst Taking In The Incredible View.,,,,,
,1671,The Tv Was Problematic.  The Signal Was Extremely Slow Making Changing Channels Very Frustrating.,,,,,
,1672,We Stayed In Rose Cottage Not A Hotel Room.,,,,,
,1675,A Little Draughty!,,,,,
,1677,Tv Was On In Room When We Arrived - Why? It Just Made The Room Ose Its Relaxing Ambience,,,,,
,1678,As Per Previous Answer Please Do Not Book Me In To Room 21 Again...,,,,,
,1680,I Think You Do Yourselves A Disservice On Your Website By Saying That The 'Classic' Rooms May Have 'Imperfections'.  Since They Are The Most Economical  They Are Obviously Not Going To Have Some Of The Attributes Of The Expensive Rooms.  We Found Our Classic Room To Be Quite Adequate And Without 'Imperfection.   I Would  However  Mention The Pillows.   They Were Both Very Hard - Providing A Soft One Also Would Be Thoughtful.,,,,,
,1681,Perfect For A Famil (B1 Lodge),,,,,
,1683,Given This Day And Age High-Speed Wifi Access Should Just Be Available To All Guests  There Should Be No Need Or Extra Charge To Have To Sign In Every Day.,,,,,
,1685,Lovely - No Complaints,,,,,
,1687,The Bedroom Was A Little Bit Cold  However The Weather Was Extreme  At The Time Of Our Stay,,,,,
,1688,Sower Head Fell Off,,,,,
,1693,The Most Comfortable Bed Ever!,,,,,
,1696,Internet Access Was Patchy At Best. Mobile Phone Signal Was Non Existent,,,,,
,1699,Room Was Next The The Lift  And On Our Second Night  When The Party Had Finished @ 12Am We Were Woken A Number Of Times By Guests Using The Lift. In Future  Maybe Put The Party Guests Near The Lift  As They Will Always Be The Latest Going To Bed And Will Be The Least Disturbed By It.,,,,,
,1700,The Temperature Of The Water For Our Bath /Shower Wasn't Really Hot Enough But Not Enough For Us To Complain About,,,,,
,1702,Thought The Space And Accommodation Was Delightful But That The Bathroom Looked A Bit Tired (Being Really Picky),,,,,
,1706,Room Slightly Smaller Than I Might Have Expected  But Very Comfortable,,,,,
,1708,Cleaning On Floor At End Of Bath Could Be Improved.  Wall Paper Behind Door Ended An Inch Too Short Of Skirting Board.  Rug At End Of Bed Was Tuned Up At Two Ends (Despite An Apparent Attempt At Sticking Down). Curtains With A Black-Out Option Would Be Welcome In The Summer.,,,,,
,1711,The Internet Access Generally Throughout The Week Was Patchy At Best. We Stayed In Lodge G1 And  Whilst We Love The Lodge/Castle Grounds Etc  I Would Comment As Follows:- The Decor Is Looking A Bit Shabby In Places With Advances In Technology Nowadays  The Tv In The Lounge Appears Very Small For Such A Large Room The Carpets And Sofas Are Looking Tired And  At The Very Least  Need A Very Good Clean,,,,,
,1713,We Had A Disabled Room.  My Husband Needs A Bath Due To Back Problems  So Not Good Not Having A Bath.  Internet We Had To Pay For.  Also Television Unavailable And The Cricket And England Rugby On.  Television Available  On Sunday But Very Complicated To Access.,,,,,
,1714,Without Doubt One Of The Best Rooms I Have Stayed In  In Any Hotel Anywhere,,,,,
,1720,Bit Mean In Terms Of Replinishing Bathroom Products (We Stayed 4 Nights And At 400 Pounds Per Night I Would Have Expected To Be Replinished With Shower Gel Etc Every Day (I Had To Ask For New Shower Gel And Shampoo!) Why Only Fudge On The First Night And No Other Night?? Again  It Is The Small Things Like That Make 400 Pounds Per Night More Worthwhile. My Baby Daughters Cot Was Placed Near A Perspex Square On The Wall (For No Reason) With Silver Screws Through It - I Caught Her With One Of The Screws In Her Mouth!  This Was Potentially Very Dangerous Indeed - Health And Safety Issues With The Room (Room Number 14). Room Was Clean But Feel As Though Housekeeping Might Have Left It A Bit 'Tidier' E.G. Bathrobes Just Strewn On Chair Where We Left Them.,,,,,
,1721,Kettle Lead 9 Inches Long! Hairdryer Use Requires Crawling Under Table.,,,,,
,1722,I Found My Room A Little Small And Also Rather Tired. It Looked To Me As Though It Needed A Freshen Up.,,,,,
,1724,Bed Was Very Very Uncomfortable  We Both Thought So. Soundproofing To Other Rooms Not That Good I Have To Say.,,,,,
,1725,Perfect !!,,,,,
,1728,Beautiful Room Well Laid Out And Everything To Hand.,,,,,
,1729,Wifi Access Aroudn The Hotel Was Limtied  But Ok In The Room,,,,,
,1731,Lock On Door Not Working By Pushing Door Would Open Easily Room 47  Lead On Kettle Very Short To Allow Easey Access To A Socket,,,,,
,1733,Door Locks Are Old Fashioned - But Do Not Look Safe...,,,,,
,1735,Excellent Accomodation,,,,,
,1736,No View Other Than Building Opposite Or Roofscape And Over Kitchens With Noise Early Morning,,,,,
,1737,Room Was At The Back Of The Hotel Near The Kitchen Vent That Stayed On Till Past 2200Hrs And Started Up Before 0600Hrs.Room Over Looking The Back Of The Hotel When There Was Rooms Free At The Front. Why?,,,,,
,1740,Had To Go Through A Fire Door Into An Adjoining Lobby To Access The Bathroom And Could Not Leave That Door Open As Noise Would No Doubt Travel To Adjoining Suite Via This Lobby,,,,,
,1744,We Had Room 11 Although Spacious And Clean There Was No Fridge  And The Door Beneath Us Was Continually Banging Went On Till Late And Early In Morning Would This Be The Staff Entrance??,,,,,
,1747,Room 32.. Bit Of A Dodgy Wardrobe Door Kept Opening.T.V Operation Could Be Simpler.,,,,,
,1748,Hot Rail In Bathroom Not Working Whole Time,,,,,
,1752,We Had A Lovely Room  But Felt It Was Rather Dated. Unfortuately Our Original Room Lacked A View With 2/3 Of The Window Blocked Out By The Roof Of A Building Directly In Front Of Us.  As A Consequence We Paid Extra For The Promotional Upgrade  Which Was A Lovely Big Room But To Be Honest I Certainly Wouldn't Pay Any More Than We Did  As We Felt It Was Rather Dated And Some Of The Furnishings Were Broken  We Couldn't Extend The Leaves On The Table  The Wheel Came Off One Of The Chairs And The Small Shelf In The Toilet Was Broken.  But On The Whole  Nothing Disasterous And We Did Have A Lovely Time.,,,,,
,1753,Everything Was Fine.,,,,,
,1758,The Room Was Fanstastic,,,,,
,1761,Decor Was A Little Tired And Could Of Done With Updating Particularly In The Bathroom.,,,,,
,1762,No Cell Phone Or Wifi Access For Most Of The Stay,,,,,
,1763,Plumbing In Room 57 Needed Attending To (Toilet Was Running On  Cold Tap On Basin Was Leaking  Plug In Sink Didnt Work Properly. Also The Tv Reception Was Very Intermittent And Frustrating  Also There Was No Movie Selection Available.,,,,,
,1766,Room Not As Big As Advertised. Dog Hairs All Over The Carpet  Had To Get Housekeeping To Come And Clean It Up! I Did Not Appreciate Having A Room That Allowed Dogs.,,,,,
,1769,Slightly Smaller Than Expected With No Real View,,,,,
,1770,Big Stain On The Carpet By The Door  And The Curtains Were Water-Stained ...Not A Problem  But Looked A Bit Off. Loved The Furniture And The Decor. Bathroom Excellent.,,,,,
,1771,Music System / Radio Difficult To Tune As Are The T.V.S,,,,,
,1773,I Thought It Needed Refurbishment,,,,,
,1775,The Poorest Part Of The Experience,,,,,
,1776,Overpriced And Dated Room,,,,,
,1778,More Shower Products Please,,,,,
,1779,Little Tired And No View At All From Window,,,,,
,1780,The Room Could Do With A Fan  And Clock Would Be Useful. Bathroom Could Do With A Magnifying Wall Mirror  Most Hotels Now Provide One.,,,,,
,1781,I Booked A Superior Castle Room  But Was Disappointed By The Fact It Was At The Back  Overlooking The Car Park.  I Had Presumed That We Would Be At The Front  Overlooking Some Of The Golf Course And Woods.  I Felt The Room Had A Bit Of An Identity Crisis  It Wasn't In Keeping With The Style Of The Building.  I Also Felt It Needed A Bit Of A Make Over. The Bath Panel Was Lose.,,,,,
,1783,Beautifully Comfortable Bed!,,,,,
,1784,The Room I Stayed In Warrants An Early Upgrade - It Came Across As Tired But Functional.,,,,,
,1785,The Room Was Comfortable But Noisy. Presumably We Were Allocated Room 12 Because We Were Staying On A Travelzoo Deal.,,,,,
,1786,On Arrival At The Hotel On One Of The Hottest Days Of The Year We Were Taken To Our Room To Find That It Was Like Being In A Sauna.  The Sun Was Beating In The Room And The Windows Were Tightly Closed And The Blinds Up!!!  We Should Have Complained  But After Travelling We Were Quite Tired.,,,,,
,1787,Linen Wonderful Quality - All First Class,,,,,
,1788,Marvellous Views,,,,,
,1792,The Only Drawers Were Desk-Type Drawers Which Were Not Large/Deep Enough To Accommodate All Our Golf Shirts/Jumpers Etc.  A Small Chest Of Drawers Or A Wardrobe With Shelves Would Have Been Ideal.,,,,,
,1793,We Were Told We Would Have A Queen Room  And Thought That If That Is What We Had It Was Small. However It Was Comfortable And Well Appointed,,,,,
,1795,Toilet Seat Was Not Secure Which Was A Surprise For Me!,,,,,
,1797,We Stayed In Down Tor  The Paper Was Peeling Off The Wall In The Toilet By The Fromt Door. Some Of The Thermostatic Radiator Valves Appeared To Be Broken Such They Were Iether Full On Or Off. There Was A Cover Missing From A Hole In The Roadway (Replaced By A Cone) Directly In Front Of The Drive  Making Access Difficult. The Handle Of The French Doors In The Main Living Room Kept Coming Off.,,,,,
,1798,Stayed In Room No 47. Had The Fan From The Bistro Coming Up Through The Room. As I Brought My Husband For A Rest After He Had Suffered A Stroke I Found This Very Inconvenient. Quite Frankly It Spoiled The Weekend This With The Vintage Cars Waking Us Up Revving Engines At 7A.M. Every Morning!,,,,,
,1800,The Air Conditioning Plant Duct Located At Our Bedside Emanated A Loud Noise Throughout The Night And Made Sleeping Difficult,,,,,
,1801,We Were Originally Given Room 17 Despite Having Requested A Twin Room.   The Staff Excelled Themselves In Getting Room 1 Ready For Us Instead (Being The Only Twin Available).  A Lovely Room  -  With Good Views.,,,,,
,1802,It Was Beautifully Located,,,,,
,1804,Tv Control Had A Mind Of Its` Own And Was Frustrating To Use Kettle Had No Convenient Location Adjacent A Power Point Sleep Disturbed By Noises Outside Room Between 04.00 And 07.00 - Sounded Like An Electric Drill But Suspect It May Have Been 'Water Hammer' In Pipework Adjacent Rooftank.,,,,,
,1805,The Bathroom Should Be Updated - For Example The Shower Was Not Efficient And The Design Is Very Tired. Higher Water Pressure Would Be An Improvement.  Also  The Bathroom Needs Decorating.  Water Stains Everywhere.,,,,,
,1807,No,,,,,
,1809,Bathroom A Little Tired. Loo Flush Was Not Working.,,,,,
,1813,Always Excellent!,,,,,
,1818,Beautifully Presented If Not A Little Small.,,,,,
,1819,Beautiful Room With Wonderful Views,,,,,
,1820,Don't Like Getting Charged For Wifi,,,,,
,1823,Beautiful Room.,,,,,
,1826,It Was Beautiful. The Size Was Amazing  The Decor Beautiful  The Coffee And Teas Etc And Bathroom Touches Including Dressing Gowns And Slippers Was Lovely.,,,,,
,1828,No Mobile Or Wifi Problems With Digi Tv,,,,,
,1831,Lovely Room  But Extremely Hot (As It Was In The Attic).  Only One Window (Which Kept Closing As It Couldn't Be Secured Open) Meant It Was Fairly Airless.  Bathroom Was Not Really That Clean - In Particular The Tiles (Which Had Some Nasty Brown Stuff On Them  Which We Can Only Hope Was Glue From The Flooring!),,,,,
,1832,We Loved Our Room It Was Big Comfortable And Equipped With Everything We Needed.  A Small Problem With Tv Was Quickly Solved.,,,,,
,1836,First Shown A Room In Attic Outlook On To Wall Smelled Unused.Not Accetable,,,,,
,1837,The Paintwork Was In Poor Repair In Places And The Bath Screen Did Not Fit Well Allowing Water To Flood On To The Floor. There Was No Soap Dish For The Soap On The Side Of The Bath. A Laundry Bag Would Have Been Useful And I Would Have Expected A Mini Bar In The Room. The Loo Seat Was Very Noisy When You Lifted It Up. The Safe Was Not In An Easily Accessible Place.,,,,,
,1838,We Had A Wet Room  Which Is Fine  Would Have Preferred A Bath  Shower Is Fine  But The Head On The Wetroom Shower In Room 1 Only Points At The Wall  So I Had To Wedge It With A Facecloth To Stay In Position.  Also The Volume On The Tv Seemed To Be Set Which Was Frustrating When Trying To Watch And Follow A Tv Programme.  Other Than That   It Was The Most Comfortable Bed  Duvet  Pillows And Mattress I Have Slept On Whilst Away  I Slept Well  I Loved The Tea Facilities  Altho It Would Have Been Better To Plug The Kettle In Nearer The Teaset!  We Were Also Very Happy With The Location Of The Room  Perfect To Pop Back To.,,,,,
,1839,There Were Finger Marks On The Bedroom Door Probably Caused By Newsprint (Not Ours!).,,,,,
,1840,The Bed Was To Small Paint In Bathroom Was Peeling Near Window  Water Marks On Bathroom Wall From Shower.,,,,,
,1842,It Was Boiling Hot - I Had To Have The Window Open During A Rain Storm - The Water In The Shower Was Tepid At Best And Was Only A Dribble Which Was Very Poor But Everything Else Was Fabulous !,,,,,
,1843,Washbasin Waste Plug Kept Sticking Closed  We Removed It During Our Stay.  The Wc Was Very Difficult To Flush.  Very Nice Bedroom,,,,,
,1847,I Find It Bizarre That There Is A Charge For Wi-Fi. Why Not Just Include It In The Room Rate?,,,,,
,1848,We Prefer To Have A Walk In Shower Beside The Bath  It's No Problem To Have Shower In The Bath For Abled Bodies But I Guess The Older Guests Mights Struggle I Personally Like Having Cushions/Sofas By The Window  I Ended Up Sitting On The Window Ledge To Enjoy The View Bed Was Very Comfortable But The Room Was A Bit Warm So We Ended Up Having To Open Windows In The Middle Of The Night There Was Constant Building/Hammering Noise During The Day Above/Near Our Room - This We Were Not Warned In Advance And It Was Getting A Bit Annoying By The 2Nd Day.. We Could Also Hear Other Guests Trotting Up And Down The Stairs Outside Our Bedroom Around Dinner Time  Bedtime And Morning  Again This We Were Not Warned Before And It Did Wake Us Up A Few Times  ,,,,,
,1850,My Husband Commented That The Room Key Reader Was Incorrectly Fitted To The Door,,,,,
,1852,Lodge C3 - Double Bed Was On The Small Side  Coat Hooks Missing By The Entrance. Decor Too Modern,,,,,
,1853,Shower Was A Bit Week,,,,,
,1854,We Paid For An Upgrade  The Room Had A Lovely View But Was A Little Tired  Eg Stains On Bathroom Flooring  Damp/Mold On Wall  Stained Cushion On Bed.,,,,,
,1861,It Was Great To Have The Seperate Room For The Children Off The Main Bedroom.,,,,,
,1862,Lovely Room And View.,,,,,
,1866,Its Lovely To Have A Fridge In The Room And Great That You Provide Fresh Milk. The Milk In The Fridge Was Semi-Skilled. We Both Drink And Are Used To Skimmed Milk. Once You Get Used To Skimmed Milk Tea Tastes Far Too Creamy With Anything Else! I Asked At Reception If It Was Possible To Have Skimmed Milk In The Fridge. I Was Told This Was Not Possible. At Breakfast The Next Morning However Skimmed Milk Was Available And I Asked If Perhaps We Could Have Some In A Jug For Our Room. The Waiter Said This Would Be Arranged. It Didn't Arrive. At Dinner That Night We Were Chatting To Caesar And He Very Happily Not Only Arranged For The Skimmed Milk But Took It Up To Our Room For Us! You Were The Consummate Professional All Evening - Thank You Caesar.,,,,,
,1867,It Was Wonderful  Great Size.,,,,,
,1868,Extremely Comfortable  Large And Relaxing  Even Though We Were Not In One Of The Rooms Overlooking The Valley (No. 12),,,,,
,1872,Cobwebs At Ceiling Level Although Bed Was Lovely Pillows Were A Little Uncomfortable - Have Been To Previous 5 Star Hotels Where They Have A Pillow Boutique,,,,,
,1874,The Room Was Too Hot For My Taste And It Was Not Clear How To Reduce The Temperature. I Opened The Windows But The Blinds Knocked Against Them And The Noise Was A Hindrance To Sleep.,,,,,
,1875,The Room / Suite Was Excellent  I Beleive We Were Upgraded And My Thanks For This. Two Very Slight Comments  The Shower Above The Bath Had Poor Water Pressure  I Prefered To Shower Down In The Pool Changing Room. The Other Comment Would Be Regarding The In Room Beverages  Fantasic Selection Of Teas Etc  Even Ground Coffee However A Real Struggle To Find A Suitable / Safe Socket To Plug The Kettle Into  Perhaps One Could Be Built Into The Unit Housing The Kettle. Neither Issue In Any Way Spoiled Our Stay  But Are Worth Mentioning.,,,,,
,1877,Upgraded To A Junior State Room - Thank You. Large Room With Good Size Bed. Found Lack Of Beakers In Bathroom To Be Puzzling - Like To Put My Toothbrush And Toothpaste In Something And To Rinse Out. Also  A Custom Made Container To Put In Used Teabags Etc. I Took The One From The Bathroom As I Didn't Want To Drip Tea Over The Pale Carpets.,,,,,
,1879,The Internet Was Extreamly Easy To Use Compared With Other Quality Hotels I Have Used.,,,,,
,1880,We Experienced Some Noise From The Extrator Fan From The Kitchen,,,,,
,1883,For A Superior Castle Room  In A 5 Star Hotel  I Did Not Expect A Shower In The Bath  That Was Less Powerful Than The One I Have At Home,,,,,
,1885,Wish We Had A View On The Front Of The Building But As This Was Our First Stay We Was Non The Wiser - We Was Very Happy With Our Room.,,,,,
,1886,The Bathroom Was Rather 'Tired' But Had All The Facilities We Needed And A King Size Bed Would Have Been Preferable.,,,,,
,1887,The Bathroom Was Abit Run Down And Generally Needed To Be Painted,,,,,
,1888,The Room Was A Little Tired And In Need Of Some Minor Repairs.,,,,,
,1891,Room Was Fantastic  Only Blip Was Window Catch Wouldn't Stay On Hold And Had To Close It In The End As Kept Banging Closed As Winds Were High. Room 48,,,,,
,1892,The Bathroom Could Have A Bit Of Sprucing Up To Get It To The Same Standard As The Bedroom.,,,,,
,1898,We Were In Bedroom 3 Which Is Near The Bistro.Noise From The Kitchen Started Early In The Morning And Disturbed Our Sleep.The Internal Door Was Extremely Heavy/Stiff And Difficult To Open. There Was Insufficient Milk For Tea And Coffee And A Request For More Had To Be Repeated. On The Positive Side The Decor Was Tasteful If A Little Shabby(Water Stains In Bathroom) And The Bed Was Very Comfortable,,,,,
,1899,Beautiful Room But The Eiderdown Had Stains On  Possibly Coffee.,,,,,
,1900,Issues With Kettle- No Table Or Shelf Near Power Point So Had To Put Kettle On Floor Near Door When Boiling Water Which Was Not Satisfactory.(Room 10) Decor In Bathroom Was Poor/Substandard For A Five Star Rated Hotel.,,,,,
,1901,It Would Be Help If Wi-Fi Was Available Throughout The Hotel.,,,,,
,1904,I Didn't Access The Internet As In A Hotel Of This Calibre I Don't Expect To Have To Pay For The Privilege.,,,,,
,1905,Room 18 Was Excellent Except Had Not Been Cleaned Behind The Bath  There Was A Champgne Cork. There Are Pencil Marks Left From When The Builders Cut Out Holes For Electric Chrome Cover Plates On The Marble Wall Tiles In The Bathroom. There Was A Weed Growing Out Of The Step On The Door Leading Onto The Balcony.  This Did Not Spoil Our Stay But You Have Envited Comments.,,,,,
,1906,There Was A Very Strange Smell! A Bit Like A Mouse Had Died In There Or Something! I Only Mention It So That You Don't Have Complaints From More Important Guests Who Are Paying Full Rate.,,,,,
,1907,Comfy  Warm And Elegant Couldnt Ask For Anymore.,,,,,
,1908,We Have Been In Grander Rooms For The Same Cost At Other Castles.  The Window Had A Large Gap! A Wonderful Selection Of Teas & Coffee But Three Sachets Of Sugar & Four Milk Cartons Weren't Enough If You Wanted More Than Two Cups On Your First Day. Room Service Swiftly Brought More Although It Would Have Been Nicer Not To Have Had To Ask So Soon In To Our Arrival.  We Can't Fault The Tidiness Of Our Bedroom  The Variety Of Toiletries  The Amount Of Towels Or The Beautifully Made Bed.,,,,,
,1912,Disappointed In The Maintenance Of The Decor. We Had Paid For An Upgrade  And Didnt Feel That We Experienced A Better Room. The Paint On The Window Sil Was Peeling. In The Bathroom There Were Marks On The Flooring Around The Sink  This I Assumed Were Toothpaste Marks. Some Of The Wallpaper In The Bathroom Had Worn Away. Finishing Touches I Didnt Expect From The Reputation That Bovey Castle Has. E.G. Cup Marks On The Coffee Table  The Cushions Used To Decorate The Bed Had Marks On  And Had A Button Missing In Places.,,,,,
,1913,The Room Was Truely Amazing In Every Way And Made Our Stay Even More Fantastic.,,,,,
,1918,When We Arrived We Were Offered The Opportunity To Upgrade Our Classic Room For A Reduced Cost Of Â£40 Per Night.  As This Was A Special Stay For Us We Did And Were Allowed Pretty Much Straight Into Our Room.  However We Soon Discovered That We Had No Robes In Our Room And Our Complimentary Tea And Coffee Facility Was Missing Milk  So The Room Wasn't Ready! Upon A Phone Call This Was Remedied In About 10 Minutes.,,,,,
,1920,We Initially Stayed In Room 13 (By The Way - I Am Not Superstitious  But A Lot Of People Are So I Would Suggest Re-Numbering To Exclude 13! - Or Call It A Name!). It Was A Very Nice Room But As It Was Hot And With No Air Conditioning  It Was Necessary To Have The Window Open. The Noise From The Kitchen Extractors Was  However  Unacceptable And For Someone Who Is A Light Sleeper (Something Which Was Mentioned At The Time Of Booking The Reservation)  It Was Impossible To Sleep. The Reception Team Were Very Good About Moving Us The Next Day To A Lovely Room On The Top Floor. It Was Much Quieter (Although We'll Be Returning In Winter Next Time As It Was Still Very Hot) - I Appreciate Though That In Older Buildings It's Just Not Possible Too Fit A/C. This Did Not Spoil Our Stay - The Team Could Not Have Done More To Make The Switch Easy!,,,,,
,1922,Beautiful Views And Super Comfy - Great To Have Black Out Blinds And It Was Sweet That You Provided Everythign That Solo (Our Dog) Could Have Needed Too. The Only Comment I Would Make Is That The Milk In Our Fridge Was Off! It Was Out Of Date By 4 Days And Had Turned Sour.,,,,,
,1925,All The Small Touches Were So Lovely  The Fudge And Room Service Menu On My Bed And The Bottle Of Water And My Bed Turned Down Was Wonderful!!,,,,,
,1927,Lovely  Would Like View Of Lawns Next Time Though,,,,,
,1932,The Bathroom Was Very Poor  Chips Inthe Bath  Grime In The Wall Tile Grout  Holes In The Tiles. The Furniture In The Bedroom Was Tired  Damaged Or Stained.,,,,,
,1933,We Stayed In Lodge Great Mist Tor  Which Was Excellent On First Impressions  But The Carpet Was Badly Stained  The Balcony Furniture Was Very Dirty And We Could Not Sit On The Chairs. The Outside Table Was Very Dirty And The Deck Area Was In  A Very Poor Decorative State.,,,,,
,1934,Bathroom Decor Was Tired Room Needs A Luggage Holder For Cases To Go So They Are Not On The Floor No Safe For Storing Valuables Such As Jewellery In The Room,,,,,
,1935,Bathroom Could Do With Updating A Little,,,,,
,1936,I Changed Room As I Was Kept Wake By The Lift. Bathroom Poorly Equip I.E. Shower Gel. Room Basic For The Room Rate,,,,,
,1937,Just Lovely Is The Only Thing To Say   ( Perfect In Every Way ),,,,,
,1939,My Husband Found Getting The Tv To Work Very Tedious.,,,,,
,1940,Paintwork In Bathroom Is Starting To Show Its Age.  In Particular Skirting Boards And The Bath Side Panel Where Screw Heads Need Cleaning Up And Retouching,,,,,
,1944,Please See Below,,,,,
,1946,Lovely And Comfortable. Good Bed,,,,,
,1947,Chipped Paint Esp Window Frame,,,,,
,1950,Bedroom Was Amazing  Very Comfortable Bed  Bath Robes Were Plush And Clean  The Only Thing I Would Say Is The Bathroom Could Be Looked Over  There Is Mould On The Wall (Could Generally Do With A Tidy Up) And The Tap On The Bath Was Not Fixed On Therefor Twisted When Trying To Turn On And Off...,,,,,
,1952,Just The Generator Outside The Room Was A Bit Noisy.,,,,,
,1959,Only Complaint Was The Milk In Our Fridge Had Gone Off  We Asked For It To Be Replaced Which It Was But Again That Was Off  Both Milks Were Still In Date Though.,,,,,
,1960,Disappointed That We Had To Pay For An Up Grade This Time.,,,,,
,1961,More Tea Bags Would Have Been Welcomed. A Few Cobwebs Were Seen On The Ceiling Of The Bedroom.,,,,,
,1968,High Charges For Wifi,,,,,
,1970,Numerous Stain On The Carpets And No Fridge For The Milk - Unlike Other Rooms. Very Comfortable Bed,,,,,
,1971,The Hot Water Stopped Working During The First Night Of Our Stay But We Were Offered The Facilitieis Of A Second Room To Utilse And The Problem With Our Room Was Rectified The Next Day.,,,,,
,1972,It Was Lovely! Very Happy With The Room.,,,,,
,1974,The Decor In The Bedroom Is Somewhat Dated Looking ( In Style  It Wasn't Shabby) And Reminded Me Of My Grans Rather Than The Classy Modern Hotel You Are.  I Felt That It Neither Aligned With The Building & Grounds Nor The Boutique Classy Feel Of The Hotel.  This Was Also Apparent From The Website  Compare The Images Of Your Rooms Vs Those Of Other Hotels And We Were Put Off Slightly ( Only A Personal Recommendation Swayed Us).  That Said It Was Entirely Functional  Etc,,,,,
,1976,We Stayed In Jaystone Lodge.  We Loved The Light And Airy Feel Of This Lodge And We Found It Generally Very Comfortable  However  There Were Several Areas We Felt Needed Attention.  Firstly  The State Of The Carpets In This Lodge Is Appalling.  Stains Galore - It Looked Terrible And Not What You'd Expect From A 5* Accommodation.  I Wouldn't Want My Child Playing On This Carpet.  Surely A Regular Clean Would Improve This?  Secondly  One Of Our Guests Was Continually Disturbed In The Lower Ground Floor Bedroom By The Water Pump Switching On And Off Throughout The Night.  He Is Not Keen To Repeat This Experience As A Decent Full Night's Sleep Was Not Had All Week.  The Windows Were Dirty And The View Was Spoilt By This - Also The Enormous Trees Outside This Lodge Made Enjoying Any Sunshine On Our Two Balconies Impossible.  May Be The Trees Should Be Pollarded?  Finally  The Outdoor Furniture Was Old  Tatty And Well Weathered.  There Were No Cushions  Which Made Sitting On It Quite Uncomfortable.  Tv Signal Pretty Poor Too.  ,,,,,
,1977,The Bath Room Pipes Made Loud Noises When The Toilet Was Flushed.,,,,,
,1979,Room Was Very Hot And During The Night  The Cold Water Tap Also Ran Hot!,,,,,
,1982,The Room Was Really Hot  We Where Above The Sauna  26 I Think  So It May Have Been Something To Do With That. I Opened The Windows But As The Wind Was Blowing Strongly I Was Worried About Them Being Smashed. ,,,,,
,1984,One Of The Rooms Was Extremely Small And Half The Size Of The Other Despite The Same Rate,,,,,
,1985,It Was Very Warm,,,,,
,1987,I Guess Because We Stayed On A Travel Zoo Promotion We Were Put In A Room Not Normally Used For Guests Paying Full Price. We Were Located In A Building Behind The Main Building. It Must Be Used For Conferences Because It Was Full Of That Sort Of Stuff And No-One Else Appeared To Be Staying In This Building! The Stairs Up To Our Room Had 2 Lights Not Working So We Had To Negotiate Parts Of The Stairs In Darkness. Taking Into Consideration The Excellent Facilities Of Bovey Castle I Believe We Got Excellent Value For Money However The Room We Stayed At Did Not Sell The Hotel At Its Best. The Promotion Price Should Be Used To Introduce People To The Hotel And Impress And Persuade Them To Book Again At Normal Prices. That Said We Did Have A Great Stay And Loved The Main Hotel Building,,,,,
,1988,Excellent Bed And Bedding.,,,,,
,1990,Heating Was Not Working In Bathroom   Maintenance Came And Bled The Radiator. On Return From Our Evening Meal This Was Again Not Working  Too Late To Ask Again !,,,,,
,1992,Would Have Liked A Bath,,,,,
,1993,I Had A Few Issues Accessing The Wi-Fi,,,,,
,1995,The Room Was A Let Down In That There Was A Great Deal Of Noise From The Kitchen Fans. We Were Advised That This Would Go Off At 10Pm But At 11:30 It Was Still Roaring Away And Was Only Turned Off After We Had Contacted Reception Again. It Came Back On At About 5Am Which Woke Us And Our Baby  And This Did Make Our Stay Much Less Enjoyable And Is Something That Would Prevent Us Coming Back Again.,,,,,
,1998,The Mini Fridge In Our Room Was Making A Very Funny Noise So We Ended Up Having To Turn It Off In The Middle Of The Night To Get To Sleep  Other Than That No Complaints At All.,,,,,
,2000,We Really Enjoyed Our Stay At Bovey Castle And Special Thanks Goes Out To The Great Staff. We Also Felt The Facilities And Atmosphere Where Very Special. The Only Part That Significantly Let It Down Was Our Room (No32). We Really Felt That For The Â£500 We Spent  It Was Very 'Bog Standard' And There Was Very Little Hint Of 'Luxury' (Eg A Big Bath  Quality Finishings)....The Rug In Our Room Was Thin And Stained And The Blanket Was 'Bobbly' And Old. The Enormous Tv Totally Dominated What Was Quite A Small Room And The Volume Didn't Work Properly.,,,,,
,2001,No Toiletries In Room. Shower Did Not Work,,,,,
,2003,Thought Charging For Internet Use Was Very Tight Considering The Amount Paying For Room.,,,,,
,2005,The Bathroom Was A Let Down  We Were In Room 8 & It Was Just Quite Tired  With Chips In The Enamel Of The Bath & Staining Down The Toilet. It Was A Little Small With Only A Shower Over A Normal Size Bath. Not What I'd Expect For Â£279 A Night.,,,,,
,2008,I Think The Bathroom Decor Looked A Little Tired.  Water Marks On The Wallpaper And It Was Peeling Off In Places. But It Was Very Clean And Functional And Large.,,,,,
,2009,The Castle Rooms Are A Bit Small For The Price. But If We Can Wish A Certain Bedroom Number For The Next Stay That Would Be Perfect. As With A German Sheperd Dog Some Space We Stayed In 58 Which Has A Good Sized Bathroom But The Bedroom Is Tiny So 56 Would Be Better,,,,,
,2010,Very Surprised At The Size Of The Rooms. We Have Travelled All Over The World And Extensively In The Uk And Was Disappointed With Room Size V Value. We Also Felt The Bathrooms Whilst Adequate Were Not 5*.,,,,,
,2011,The Sink Didn't Drain Well And The Room Lighting Was Adequate Rather Than Ideal.  That Said The Furniture And Overall Feel To The Room Was Lovely,,,,,
,2012,We Stayed In A Lodge  Which Was Very Nice.,,,,,
,2013,Room Was Great. Just Noticed There Were Quite A Lot Of Dead Flies Behind The Radiator In Room 4 And Some Cobwebs Around Top Part Of Bedroom Window. Didn't Want To Say This Out Loud At Reception As Didn't Spoil My Stay.,,,,,
,2015,Child Cod Slightly Rickety,,,,,
,2016,Room Very Comfortable But Some Kind Of Generator Running Out Side Until About Midnight. On Again At 07.00 & 06.00 On The Monday,,,,,
,2018,I Found The Television Operation Was Not Easy Or Intuitive. The Carpets Could Look Better. Not Enough Shelving In The Bathroom To Put Toothbrushes  Shavers  Etc.,,,,,
,2019,The Room Itself (Room 11) Was Very Nice.  Unfortunately While One Bedroom Window Overlooked The Side Courtyard  The Other Bedroom Window And Bathroom Window Overlook Roofs And Were Extremely Close To The Airconditioning Units Which At Times Where Very Noisy.,,,,,
,2020,The Info In The Room Mentioned Wi-Fi Access In The Bedrooms But We Couldn't Access It But I'm Not Entirely Sure About The Wi-Fi Access As We Weren't Bothered Enough To Ask About It So It Didn't Really Matter...We Both Had No Signal On Our Phones The Whole Time We Were There  Not In The Room  Public Areas Or Grounds.,,,,,
,2021,Fridge Had Been Removed From The Room,,,,,
,2022,We Had Room 19 We Loved The Room  If I Was Being Hyper Critical The Bathroom Was A Little Sparse  But We Were More Than Happy.,,,,,
,2023,It Was Too Expensive  Described As A Superior  Felt Standard  Charge Was Superior.,,,,,
,2026,The Room (9) Did Not Have A Nice View At All And Was Quite Small.  The Condensation On The Window Sill Was Really Bad Each Morning And The Steam/Condensation In The Bathroom Had Ruined The Bathroom Blind  As It Had Lots Of Water Stains On It  Not Very Practical For A Bathroom.  I Accept I Was On A Travelzoo Deal And Didn't Expect A Brilliant Room.  When Booking I Was Asked If It Was For A Special Occasion And I Informed The Hotel It Was For Our Wedding Anniversary And Thought There Might Be A Card Of Something  Which There Wasn't.,,,,,
,2027,Given The Cost Of The Stay  We Do Feel That Wi-Fi / Internet Access And Movies Should Have Been Included In The Room Rate. We Run 5 Star Self Catering Cottages And Charge A Fraction Of The Cost Of A Hotel Like Bovey But Include Dvd's And Free Wi-Fi To Guests.,,,,,
,2032,I Booked A Room For My Parents As They Were Celebrating My Mothers 70Th  And We Thought It Would Be Nice For Them To Stay Over After We All Had Sunday Lunch And Afternoon Tea. On Seeing The Room I Was Very Disappointed To Note That Theirs Overlooked The Gutter And Roof. Whilst I Appreciate That The Room Was Only A Classic And The Views Very Limited  I Really Think They Could Have Been Put In A Different Room. I Know My Parents Wouldnt Have Complained And They Really Enjoyed Themselves But In The Circumstances I Believe The Allocation Should Have Been Better Thought Out. I Spoke To A Reservations Staff Member Who Phoned Me Beforehand And Said He Would Make A Note Of The Occasion So You Were Informed!! A Slight Damper On The Otherwise Lovely Stay.,,,,,
,2037,Being Charged For The Internet Felt Rather Petty.   Also Lovely To Have Tea  Coffee  Mill Etc But Not Every One Likes Coconut Biscuits!  ,,,,,
,2039,There Was Inadequate Lighting  So The Room Was Rather Dark.,,,,,
,2040,The Furnishing Spec Of Such An Upgrade Was Not Commensurate With Cost Of Suite.  Furniture  Was Drab And Not Designed To Fit Comfortably Into Room Layout.  The Provision Of One Radiator Was Woefully Inadequate Given The Height Of The Ceiling And Necessitated An Additionall Heater.,,,,,
,2041,The Room Itself Was Lovely. However  Just Outside The Window Was A Wall So There Was No View. The Building Directly Outside The Window Housed A Fan That Could Be Heard All The Time When The Window Was Open. The Noise Stopped At About 11Pm.,,,,,
,2042,Rather Disgusted As We Found A Soiled Bed Pillow  This Was Found Because It Was So Badly Soiled It Showed Though The Pillow Case. This Was Replaced Once Reported.,,,,,
,2043,Not That We Needed It But There Was No Drawer Space; Can Understand It But No Teapot,,,,,
,2044,Very Disappointed With The Room Itself  It Was Very Cramped And Had A Very Disappointing Outlook Over The Service Yard And Early In The Morning It Sounded As If A Kitchen Extractor Fan Had Started Up.  Everything Else About Our Stay Was Excellent But This Could Put Us Off Wanting To Come Back. We Were In Room 9!,,,,,
,2046,It Was Beautiful,,,,,
,2047,Very Spacious,,,,,
,2048,The Bathroom Was Badly In Need Of Updating,,,,,
,2049,I Loved Our Room  Number 11  Until It Was Time To Sleep. The Room Was Quite Hot So We Needed The Window Open And That's Where The Problem Lay. There Was An Enormous Amount Of Noise Caused By ? Loading/Unloading Of Vehicles Directly Beneath Our Window. Several Men Were Chatting  Shouting And Even Whistling With Vehicles Revving And Being Moved About From Around 22.00 Till Way Past Midnight And Then Again Before Daylight. On The Other Side Of The Room Across The Roof Was A Large Extractor Fan Making A Humming Noise Constantly So We Were Unable To Open Windows On That Side Of The Room. All This Unfortunately Spoilt An Otherwise Amazing Stay. I Was Tired The Next Day From Lack Of Sleep.,,,,,
,2050,Lighting Was A Little Too Dim.,,,,,
,2051,I Know That It Is Common Practice To Charge For Internet In Hotels But  In This Day And Age  It Is Something We Find Annoying. This Is Often Alleviated By Using Smart Phone For Essential Internet Use But  Poor Signal At Bovey  So This Was Difficult Too! This Is A Common Discussion Topic At Dinner Parties And Seems To Be A Bone Of Contention For Everybody. We Do A Lot Of Travelling  Both In England And Worldwide  And It Is Starting To Be Part Of Our Decision Making Process.,,,,,
,2054,The Safe In Room Didn't Work And Was Not Repaired In Our 4 Day Stay Had Jewellery So Disappointed.,,,,,
,2055,The Mat Was Awful  Discoloured And Turning Up At The Edges,,,,,
,2056,Beautifully Decorated  Lovely View!,,,,,
,2058,The Bathroom Is Not Very Well Designed,,,,,
,2060,Very Comfortable Bed. Where Space Allowed 2 Comfy Chairs In The Room Would Have Been Nice. Super Towels.,,,,,
,2061,The Bedroom Overall Was Very Comfortable But The Central Heating Pipes Were Extremely Noisy Especially First Thing In The Morning When They Started Up  This Woke Me Up,,,,,
,2063,Kettle Plug Not Conveniently Placed Near Kettle And Beverage Container.,,,,,
,2072,I Would Relay The Carpets With Something More Forgiving,,,,,
,2073,Bright Lights Around Bedroom Mirror Would Be More Practical For Doing Make Up As Felt Very Dark Even With All The Lamps Switched On.,,,,,
,2074,There Was Rust On The Carpet By The Window From The Frame Of The Metal Unit. I Didn't Use The Internet.,,,,,
,2075,Bed Was A Bit Soft For Me  But That Is A Very Personal Thing And You Can't Please All The People All Of The Time!  Some Like Hard Beds And Some Like Soft...!  The Bed Linen Was Exquisite! Perhaps Over Large Pictured As There Was Such Patterned Paper.,,,,,
,2080,On The Right Hand Side Of The Tv/Fridge Cabinet  Towards The Bottom  There Was A Stain/Mark.  It Was Only Noticed On The Day We Left  And We Forgot To Mention It To The Check-Out Staff. There Were Two Dead Flies By The The Bathroom Window.  They Were Only Cleaned Away On Saturday Evening. The Bed Was A Little Soft For Us  But That Is Personal Preference.,,,,,
,2082,Bathroom Very Dated Mould On Th Really By Bath,,,,,
,2084,Given The Mobile Reception Was Very Poor  I Would Recommend That You Make Wireless Free. It Seemed Like Unnecessarily Petty To Charge For Internet Given The Room Costs And Undermines Your Otherwise Faultless Service.,,,,,
,2085,Slight Damp On The Wall Which Slightly Spoiled The Otherwise Perfect Presentation.,,,,,
,2088,The Window Sill Paint Had Pealed And The Ceiling Needed Repainting As There Must Have Been A Leak Previously. However The View And The Bed Were Wonderful.,,,,,
,2091,I Loved The Room But Hated-M Really Hated The Shower.  The Showerhead Was Far Too Far Up- I Am Very Tall And I Could Not Get The Soap Out Of My Hair.  It Was So Weak.  Waited Until I Got Home To Shower The Following Day - It Was That Bad.,,,,,
,2092,Bed Was Comfortable And The View Excellent But  The Whole Room Looked A Little Tired.  There Were Stains On The Ceiling And Wallpaper And The Bathroom Looked Dated.  The Shower Enclosure Over The Bath Would Not Shut And Leaked Water On The Floor When In Use.  I Would Expect A/C In A Room Of This Price.,,,,,
,2095,It Seems A Bit Mean To Charge Â£1 For Wifi,,,,,
,2096,Requested A Twin Room On Booking As Was Staying With My Son. We Were Given A Double Room But This Was Rectified Very Quickly And We Preferred The Room We Ended Up With  So No Problem.,,,,,
,2097,Would Have Liked More Hooks In The Room To Hang Coats Etc On Also In The Bathroom For Towels When Getting In And Out Of The Shower,,,,,
,2098,The Room (52) We Slept In Unfortunately For Us Was By The Lift So You Could Hear The Lift Coming Up And Down Also There Was An Awful Humming Sound All Night Long - At One Point I Assumed It Was From The Fridge Or Tv - But Once In The Morning Discussing This With Other Guests We Were With Apparantly On Of Those Thought It Must Have Been A Generator...Luckily For Us We Had The Room As A Discounted Price However You Would Have Been Pretty Upset If You Were Staying There Longer Than One Night - Besides That I Was Completely Happy With The Room/Bathroom.,,,,,
,2101,It Was Simply 'The Best'  Suite 18.   We've Never Stayed Anywhere Quite So Immaculate And Tastefully Designed. Delighted,,,,,
,2102,No Laundry Bags  Had Difficulty With Internet Access On My Ipad.  Only Very Spotty 3G (Mobile) Reception  No Information To Guests Regarding 3G Limitations And Solutions,,,,,
,2105,Gangway To Toilet Past Shower Unit Just A Little Tight!,,,,,
,2106,We're Fortunate That There Was Space To Transfer From Room 11 (With Noisy Extractors Outside Window) To Room 32 That Although Less Spacious Was At Least Peaceful.,,,,,
,2107,Some Of The Stairs Carpets And The Corridors Could Do With Refurbishment.,,,,,
,2108,The Inner Door Slammed Shut With A Bang And If You Forgot You Could Easily Disturb Others,,,,,
,2109,It Was Impossible To Access Radio Or Other Channels Via The Tv.  Radio 4 In The Morning Is Important To Many People.,,,,,
,2112,Spacious  Clean And Comfortable.,,,,,
,2113,The Slowness Of The Free Wifi Was The Only Minor Dissatisfaction - But I Can Also See Why You Need To Slow It Down As It Encourages Use Of The Paid For Wifi...,,,,,
,2114,Top Top Top!,,,,,
,2118,We Were A Bit Disappointed With The Room. We Were There For A Special Occasion So I Had Upgraded From A Classic Room To I Think A Castle Room/Suite But When We Got To The Room As Far As I Was Concerned It Wasn't A Worth While Up Grade The Room Was Of Standard Size With A View Of The Carpark!! I Didn't Want To Complain At The Time As I Didn't Want To Spoil Our Stay.,,,,,
,2119,Thought The Bedroom Could Have Been More Luxurious,,,,,
,2120,Bathroom Needed Updating. I Expected A Bigger Modern Bath And Separate Shower,,,,,
,2123,The Bed Was Made Up Of 2 Singles Pushed Together - But Otherwise Everything Was Great.,,,,,
,2124,A Rather Noisey Humming Fridge!,,,,,
,2125,The Room Badly Requires Refurbishment.,,,,,
,2129,Did Not Like The Wardrobe,,,,,
,2130,In My Opinion Wifi Should Be Complimentary At This Standard Of Hotel.,,,,,
,2131,An Old Bugbear - Wastebins. There Was Just One And It Was In The Bathroom And Ludicrously Small. There Was A Used Q-Tip In The Plughole Black At Both Ends Which Looked As If It Had Been Used To Clean Something Filthy. I Drew That To The Attention Of Reception - It Was Not A Major Problem.,,,,,
,2132,Would Have Preferred A 6 Ft Bed Rather Than A 5 Ft One And The Duvet On The First Night Was Far To Thick For The Time Of Year. Nice Room Well Decorated.,,,,,
,2133,Too Expensive For Just A Large Room  Nothing Did The Room Special It Was Just A Normal Room But Larger. I Will Never Pay This Money For A Room Like That.,,,,,
,2134,The Only Problem We Had Was Finding A Socket For Our Kettle! But Considering The Standard Of The Rest Of Our Stay And The Service It Didn't Have Any Impact On Our Stay.,,,,,
,2135,Lovely Room And Lovely Facilities,,,,,
,2136,It Was Perfect.,,,,,
,2137,We Used The Baby Monitor System  Which Was Great - We Really Enjoyed A Nice Meal While Others Were Making Sure Our Baby Was Sleeping Fine.,,,,,
,2139,No,,,,,
,2140,My Only Slight Complaint Is That I Was Kept Awake On Both Nights Of Our Stay By Groups/Functions Going On Downstairs Below The Room. I Was Suprised By This. Also  Our Room Wasn't Cleaned Until 4Pm After Our First Night Which Was A Little Inconvenient But I Understand There Were A Lot Of People Checking Out After New Year So It Was Maybe Due To That Reason.,,,,,
,2141,Decor Needs To Be Updated,,,,,
,2143,Very Comfortable,,,,,
,2144,We Stayed At The Gatehouse And Found It Very Comfy And Tidy But Loads Of Cobwebs All Over The Windows Causing Huge Spiders. Did Not Agree With The Overly Priced Internet Charges.,,,,,
,2145,I Was Originally Placed On The Top Floor Valley Bedroom Which Was Not Very Comfortable And Was Not What I Had In Mind  Fortunately This Was Soon Sorted Out By Fedrico And We Were Very Pleased To Be Moved To A Splendid Valley Room.,,,,,
,2148,Slight Rattle Of Window In Bedroom As Small Spacer Was Missing. Tv Signal Caused Freezing Of Picture And Sound On Several Occassions. The 2 Middle Windows In Bathroom Were Suffering From Misting Inside The Double Glazed Units.,,,,,
,2153,Some Parts Of Lodge Looked A Bit Tired And In Need Of Attention Eg Bedroom Carpet Stained  Chair In Lounge Area Marked. Bin Lid In Kitchen Didn't Fit. Could Do With More Cooking Pots And A Tray.,,,,,
,2156,In This Standard Of Room It Would Have Been A Good Idea To Have Had A Fridge,,,,,
,2158,Front Desk Never Mentioned The Internet Or Access For It On Arrival. We Had To Stop By The Desk The Next Morning To Figure Out Why We Couldnt Get On.,,,,,
,2160,Internet Was Down For A Period And Slow Download Speed,,,,,
,2161,We Upgraded And We Were Pleased To Do So - Friends Had Visited Before And Had Suggested We Do So. Pillows On The First Night Were Dreadful - Asked For Them To Be Replaced And They Were. Bathroom Was Cold And This Was Not Attended To Despite A Number Of Requested.,,,,,
,2162,Sumptuous,,,,,
,2163,Disappointed With Room  Very Small And No View  But It Was The Bathroom Which Really Let The Room Down. Tiles A Little Mouldy  Bath Casing Looked A Little Rotten  Generally Very Stark.,,,,,
,2164,The Pillows Were Hard And Uncomfortable,,,,,
,2165,The Real Coffee In Our Room Was Extremely Difficult To Sort Out Without Spilling Or Getting Fingers Wet; I Realise That It Doesn't Sound As Good  But I Would Rather Have Had Instant!  Or Perhaps Those Little 'Teabags' Of Real Coffee?,,,,,
,2166,The Shower Gels Etc. Were Very Good Quality And All The Extras Were Much Appreciated.  We Loved The Tea/Coffee Box With Biscuits.  Thank You For The Fudge On The Pillow.,,,,,
,2168,We Stayed In Room 54 And The Window Stay Was Broken  So That There Was No Way To Fix The Window In An Open Position.,,,,,
,2169,Had Great Difficulty Turning The Shower On - Too Stiff,,,,,
,2172,Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,2173,We Had The Family Adjoining Room Which Was Very Spacious And Perfect For Our Needs As It Was 2 Separate Rooms.,,,,,
,2177,Bed Was Very Soft So Both Woke With Backache!,,,,,
,2178,Tv Was Difficult To Work  No Instructions. Wifi Access Seemed Very Resticted  Even When Logged On.,,,,,
,2181,It Would Be Nice To Have An Iron & Ironing Board In The Room Rather Than Having To Ask For One.,,,,,
,2182,It Was Lovely Fantastic Views Comfortable Bed - Very Luxurious,,,,,
,2186,We Stayed In The Gorseland Lodge Which Was Excellent And Superbly Placed,,,,,
,2191,Extremely Comfortable  Lovely Decor  Very Clean And Spacious.,,,,,
,2192,The Hand Basin Was Clogged The Whole Time And We Had To Wash Out Teethin The Shower. It Was Fixed A Couple Of Times Unsuccessfully. Also The Door To The Bathroom Had To Be Fixed. I See An Opportunity For Improvement In The Maintenance Area. This Doesn't Match The Prices You Charge!,,,,,
,2193,Very Cold And Windy During Our Stay And The Radiators Were Turned Off.,,,,,
,2195,Slightly On The Warm Side In The Bathroom  Especially The Shower Area For Some Reason - Maybe Insulation.,,,,,
,2197,A Little Tired!,,,,,
,2198,Light  Spacious And Airy With Wonderful Views.,,,,,
,2199,We Were Given An Upgrade Of Which We Were Delighted With. I Would However Have Been Disappointed If I Had Paid For The Upgrade As There Were A Few Snags In The Room  Mainly Looking A Bit Tired  Lightbulb Out On The Lamp And Chipped Paint On The Windowsill. Apart From That Very Pleased With The Complementary Toiletries And The Dressing Gown Was Superb!,,,,,
,2201,The Only Thing Was That The Ground Floor Bedroom Was Very Cold Compared To The Rest Of The Lodge As The Thermostat Is In The Kitchen Dining Area.,,,,,
,2202,Obviously As A 'Deal' We Had The Lowest Grade Room And Even That Was Delightful And As We Stayed Only One Night(Wedding Anniversary) And It Was December The Lack Of View Didn't Matter At All.,,,,,
,2205,Only Slight Negative Was That The Room Was Very Hot With No Fan Or Air Con.,,,,,
,2208,It Was To Far From The Bar,,,,,
,2209,Â£700 A Night And You Still Charge Me For Internet Access???? That's Just Profiteering... Also  For A Five Star Room (Grand State Room No Less...) I Don't Really Expect To Have To Ask For An Iron And Ironing Board To Be Sent To The Room (On Three Separate Occasions) And When It Arrives It Was A Crappy Little 'Tesco' Branded Iron?!?!  Also  No Bin In The Living Room Area So Our Used Tea Bags Etc Were Sat Around On The Sides  And No Brown Sugar In The Room? All Little Things But Very Important To My Enjoyment Nonetheless.  The Shower Door Didn't Shut Properly So It Leaked  And The Wallpaper In The Bathroom Was Water Stained.   To Be Honest  The Hotel Was Spectacular But The Room Was A Massive Let Down. Probably Only Worth Half What I Paid For It....,,,,,
,2211,No,,,,,
,2214,I Didnt Have Any Milk In The Room I Did Have To Call Twice To Get This!,,,,,
,2215,Our Double Bed Was Two Singles Pushed Together Which Is Never Ideal.,,,,,
,2217,Bathroom Was A Bit Dated And Worn But The Actual Bedroom Was Lovely.,,,,,
,2218,I Would Have Liked A Bath - If They'd Asked Me About This When We Booked  I Would Have Requested One And Was Slightly Disappointed To Discover There Was Only A Shower!,,,,,
,2219,We Stayed With You In Your Classic Room Due To Us Having A Voucher Deal. Which Was Fine And We Were Very Happy With It  Until The Disco Started! As Its Our One Night Away In Year We Have Without Our Kiddies We Were A Bit Put Out. So My Husband Went To Reception And They Moved Us Straight Away. It Was Just A Bit Disappointing Having To Move Rooms At 11.00 At Night In Your Nightwear. If You New Their Was Going To Be Such A Loud Party It Would Have Been Nice To Have Been Put In A Better Room Right Away Rather Then Being Moved At 11.00 O'clock.,,,,,
,2222,Could Do With A Luggage Holder To Put Your Bag On And Towels Were Hard.Lamp Did Not Work On Arrval Needed New Bulb And The Ligjt Switches On The Walls Were Dirty And The Noise From The Outside Extractor Fan Was Loud.Lastly As In The Same Buisness Very Shocked To See The State Of The Bathroom Extrator Fan Never Had Been Cleaned.Did Tell Some One So No One Else Could Hear As We Look After 5 Star Properties Ourself Down Salcombe And Would Want To Be Told Not Read It On Trip Afvisor.,,,,,
,2226,Layout Of The Bathroom Wasn't Great & The Tv Was Past It's Best,,,,,
,2228,The Only Very Small Thing Was When We Had A Shower We Did Find That The Bath Was Quite Slippery.,,,,,
,2229,Absolutely No Mobile Signal......Very Primitive In This Day And Age....Bedroom Very Basic And Because We Were Virtually In The Roof And The Weather Was Blowing A Gale It Felt Like We Were Outdoors In The Gale....Virtually No Sleep For The Two Days Because Of The Wind Howling Through The Windows.......Had Orange Tap Water Out Of Both Hot And Cold Taps In The Bathroom....Which I Was Assured Was Unharmful Natural Spring Water....Very Off Putting Brushing Your Teeth In This Discoloured Water.....Bed Was Comfy .....Plug Sockets Were Not Accessible For Electricals Did Not Have Anywhere To Place Room Kettle To Boil Water,,,,,
,2231,The Loo Pan Was Stained. It Didn't Matter To Me But It Might To Others. Very Clean Room  Thanks.,,,,,
,2232,Bathroom Was Small Will Upgrade To Larger Room On Next Visit,,,,,
,2233,Our Room Was A Complimentary Upgrade Which Was Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,2236,Possibly A Little Warm For Our Taste But Could Open The Window,,,,,
,2239,I Could Not Access The Hotel Internet,,,,,
,2241,No Extraction In Bathroom. Everywhere Got Hot With A Lot Of Condensation. We Kept The Window Open To Minimise The Problem.,,,,,
,2242,Noisy Because Of The Kifchen's Extractor Fan System.,,,,,
,2247,I Expect A Fast Internet Service At No Additional Charghe As Nowadays This Is A Basic Utility  Such As Television And Electricity,,,,,
,2248,We Were Woken At About 5.30-6.00Am On Sunday Morning By The Noise From The Extractor Fan On The Roof Below Our Window(Room 35) Overlayed Occasionally By The Sound Of What We Assume Was Rubbish Being Dumped Into Bins.Hence Not Conducive To Good Sleep Such A Shame As The Other Aspects Of Our Stay Were So Good Especially The Friendly And Excellent Service Provided By Your Staff.,,,,,
,2249,It Would Be Appealing If Wi Fi Was Available Free Of Charge For A Limited Time To Enable Guests To Check Emails Or Have A Wifi Area For This Purpose.,,,,,
,2252,The Double Glazing Is Past It's Sell By Date!! It Was Very Misted And Spoilt The Lovely View. Bed And Chairs Were Very Comfortable And The Room Was Warm Even Tho The Radiator Was Only Just Warm In The Evening. We Slept With A Window Wide Open. Very Nice Elemis Products In The Bathroom.,,,,,
,2255,A Hotel Of This Standard Should Not Be Charging For Internet,,,,,
,2257,I Would Have Liked The Use Of A Safe As I Had Several Thousand Pounds On Me And Although I Trust Both The Staff And Other Guests Would Have Preferred The Option To Safe The Money When Awa From The Room,,,,,
,2259,Please Just Charge A Few More Pounds To The Room Fee For The Internet . It Is Very Tacky To Have To Pay And Get A Code Etc ( Time Consuming !! ) . The Hotel Internet (Free) Is Not Adequate For Most Urbanites . Again   We Stay In Many Hotels And It Is Included In The Price . Made The Hotel Seem A Bit One Star . ,,,,,
,2260,Room 50 Was Great. Also I Suddenly Had Work To Do And There Was Not A Problem In Accessing The Internet From My Laptop. Rooms Were Excellent. Light And Lots Of Space,,,,,
,2261,Just Our T.V Was A Really Bad Picture .,,,,,
,2264,It Was The Most Beautiful And Comfortable Room Iâ´Ve Ever Been.,,,,,
,2268,Bedroom Was Rather Small  & The Outlook Not Very Pleasant  A Brick Wall. Slightly Disappointed We Weren't Offered A Nicer Room Considering The Hotel Was Empty. Carpet Stained In Entrance Hall & A Very Small Bed !,,,,,
,2269,I Found The Bedrooms A Bit Shabby  Which Was Disappointing. There Were Stains On The Furniture And Marks On The Walls. I Thought The Decor Was A Little Out-Dated And Didn't Reflect The High Standard Of The Rest Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,2270,It Would Have Been Helpful To Of Had Our Own Mini Fridge.,,,,,
,2271,Mattress Has Seen Better Days As A Result Of Being Sat On Lots And Not Turned Enough. The Bathroom Was A Little Disappointing Overall Given The Overall Standard Of The Rest Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,2272,Sometimes Inconsistent Level Of Service When Cleaning Regarding Times Room Was Cleaned  Replacement Of Items And Tidiness In Bathroom,,,,,
,2273,Needs Updating,,,,,
,2274,We Were Upgraded To A Superior Room Which Was Really Lovely And Definitely Value For Money At The Â£229 Per Night Room. Had We Stayed In The Classic Room I Would Have Been Disappointed With The Lack Of Bath Which Is Really Important When Paying Over Â£200 Per Night.,,,,,
,2280,The Only Reason The Safe And Secure Is So Poorly Scored Is Due To Events That Have Come To Attention Since My Stay,,,,,
,2282,The Lodge Was Clean And Very Well Equipped. Perfect For What We Wanted And Exceeded Expectations,,,,,
,2284,Room 49 Was Superb.,,,,,
,2285,Room 52 Is Very Close To The Lift Which We Could Hear From Within The Bedroom. This Didn't Really Spoil Our Enjoyment Though  As We Slept Incredibly Well On Both Nightsâ€¦Probably Helped By The Comfortable Bed And Excellent Food And Wine!!,,,,,
,2286,Housekeeping Didnt Always Replace Toilet Rolls And Toiletries,,,,,
,2287,We Had To Call The Front Desk Twice To Get Instructions To Connect To The Wi Fi As The Instructions And Codes Originally Given To Us Were Wrong.  It Was Very Time Consuming And Difficult To Get Someone Who Could Give Us Correct Instructions.  The Coffee Was Not Replenished In Our Room.,,,,,
,2288,The Lighting In Room 47 Was Quite Low Which Made Working/Reading In Bed Difficult.Perhaps Higher Wattage Of Bulb Would Help?,,,,,
,2294,All Very Good But How About Coat Hooks At The Entrance And Faster And Easier Wifi?,,,,,
,2295,Bathroom Was In Need Of Modernising.,,,,,
,2296,Overall  We Really Enjoyed Staying At The Lodge. The Bathrooms Were The Only Let Down. The Showers Sprayed Into The Bathroom So The Floor Always Got Wet. The Decor In The Bathrooms Felt Less Impressive (Verging On Tacky) Than The Rest Of The Lodge.,,,,,
,2297,Jaystone Lodge  Fantastic!,,,,,
,2301,Everything Was Good Apart From The Internet Access.,,,,,
,2305,Room Felt Cold  So A Portable Heater Was Provided.,,,,,
,2306,I Felt That The Wallpaper In The Bathroom Around The Shaving Mirror Looked A Little Tired.,,,,,
,2309,Didn't Like That Two Beds Had Been Pushed Together. This Led To One Of Us Always On The Join. Also Our Bedroom Overlooked The Courtyard And A Noisy Air Con Unit,,,,,
,2312,We Didnt Try To Access The Internet Because Of The Hourly Charge Which Seems Ridiculous Given The Amount You Charge For Rooms. Internet These Days Is Viewed As A Necessity Not A Luxury And Should Really Be Readily Available At No Charge.,,,,,
,2313,Loved The Amount Of Space (The Extra Hallway Made All The Difference) We Had With The Interconnecting Room For The Kids,,,,,
,2314,Beds Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,2315,Have Stayed In Cheaper Hotels With Better Bathrooms - Thought A Little Dated With Bath/Shower.  Toilet Seat Was Broken But Did Get Mended Very Quickly After Reported.,,,,,
,2318,Some Elements Weren't Very Clean (Blocked Plug  Mould On Shower Screen) And Some Of The Design Was Poor (Shower Blocked Light So You Couldn't See Very Well By The Toilet) And Some Maintenance Needed Doing (Shower Leaked  Damage To The Wall) And The Door Was Difficult To Lock.  These Items Are Minor  The Rooms Was Generally Very Good  But Not What I Would Expect For A Hotel Of This Standard.,,,,,
,2319,Too Warm In The Night,,,,,
,2320,Room 40 Bathroom Needs Upgrading. Very Dissapointed With A Small Bath With Shower Over And Old Fashioned Glass Screen With Stained Grout And Mastic In An Apparent? Superiour Castle View Room. This Makes The Room A Classic In My Eyes!,,,,,
,2321,We Had To Place The Kettle On The Floor As The Lead Was Too Short To Reach A Plug And Be Placed On A Hard Surface  Not Ideal. Also There Was No Waste Paper Bin In The Bedroom.,,,,,
,2326,All Was Great And The Children Loved Their Robes And Slippers,,,,,
,2327,The Noise Insulation On The 3Rd Floor Is Shockingly Bad.  We Could Hear Everything In The Room Next To Us From The Baby Crying To The Ensuing Arguments.  As A Regular Guest  I Would Expect That The Reservations/Check In Staff Would Use Knowledge Of The Hotel To Not Allocate Rooms With Such Bad Sound Insulation Or Advise Upgrading To A Different Room To Avoid This.  It Actually Ruined Our Weekend As We Had No Sleep On Our Final Night.,,,,,
,2330,Our Room Was Well Presented And Well Maintained By The Maids During Our Stay. Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,2333,Does Need A Bit Of Maintenance - Door Handle Was Loose On The Kitchen Door To The Balcony And One Of The Bed Headboards Was Off But Otherwise Loved It.,,,,,
,2334,Where Was The Tv In The Master Bedroom,,,,,
,2336,Admittedly We Only Stayed In One Of Your Classic Doubles  But The Bathroom Shape Was Odd. Also  There Were Several Mosquitos In The Shower Room. Although The Shower Was Excellent  There Is Nowhere To Place Soap Easily To Hand. The Shelf Above The Sink Is Badly Positioned (It Would Be Better To Have A Shelf To The Side). In The Current Position It Is In The Way Of Using The Basin To Some Degree.,,,,,
,2337,Reported The Shower Not Working In The Bathroom But Did Not Get A Follow Up Call To Say It Had Been Fixed Which Was A Little Frustrating.,,,,,
,2338,Room Was Smelling Of Damp And Was A Bit Grubby Due To Stained Carpet And Bedding,,,,,
,2339,The Internet Failed To Connect On One Day Of Our Stay. The Bedroom Looked Quite Tired  And The Toilet Leaked - Which Was Reported To Reception.,,,,,
,2340,Coat Hooks In The Lobby Area Would Have Been Nice,,,,,
,2342,Unfortunately Other Guests Are Not As Respectful As We Are To Your Furnishings  So Maybe Some Mats Inside The Bedroom Door To Encourage Other Guests To Remove Their Shoes Before Tramping Over The Nice Carpets,,,,,
,2344,Internet Kept Dropping,,,,,
,2346,It Is A Shame That Interent Access Was Not Available Immediately (We Had To Get An Engineer To Reboot System) And It Is Unhelpful To Have To Keep Logging In To Use The Free Service.  It Is Also Disappointing That There Is Such A Lack Of Mobile Phone Signal. It Took The Edge Off Our Stay As The Lodge Is In Need Of Maintenance  Leaking Showers  Handles Falling Of Of External Doors And Shower Doors  Hob Lights Not Working Etc. Tv In Bedroom Didnt Appear To Work.  The Downstairs Ensuite Had An Unpleasnt 'Drain' Smell.  It Seems A Shame That The Lodges Are Being Allowed To Deteriorate From A Clearly High Initial Standard.  We Pointed Some Things Out  But Felt It Is A Shame That These Thigs Are Not Spotted And Addressed More Readily.,,,,,
,2347,A Very Homely Bedroom,,,,,
,2348,There Was A Large Stain On One Pannel Of Our Blinds  And Our Bed Cover Was Very Dirty. The Latter Was Removed For Sleeping Otherwise  Would Have Asked For It To Be Changed.  The Dog's Bed And Bowls Were Too Small For The Breed Of Dog ( I'd Advised You That She Was A Labrador.)  The Bed Was Too Soft.  The Room Was Also Very Hot  Perhaps Windows Might Have Been Opened Prior To Arrival. On Hot Days The Turn Down Service Should Not Include Window Shutting!,,,,,
,2349,You Do Have Developing Issues With Penetrating Damp (Wall Facing The Carpark).  But It Is An Old Building.,,,,,
,2351,Very Clean & Bright  A Lovely Bedroom Room & Bathroom,,,,,
,2353,Bathroom Was Quite Cold And Also Water Not That Hot Sat Eve/Sun Morning.   Tv Could Do With All Free View Stations.   Why Not Incorporate Price Of Wifi Into The Room  Price Rather Than Having To Sign On The Whole Time.,,,,,
,2355,Slept Better The Second Night When We Turned The Heating Off! I Don't Like To Be Cold But In General We Found The Whole Hotel Rather Too Warm. It Must Be Very Expensive To Heat  And Could Be More Comfortable For Being A Degree Or Two Cooler.,,,,,
,2357,No Sweeteners And Wifi Was Very Slow,,,,,
,2360,Poor Decoration For The Rate  Wall Paper And Curtains With Water Leak Stains  Tv Not Working Properly  Mattresses Very Poor Quality,,,,,
,2361,I Found The Whole Experience Wonderful. The Design Was To My Taste And The Attention To Detail Was Excellent. May I Extend My Compliments To All Your Staff  They To Were Excellent.,,,,,
,2362,Room Was Very Small And Not Indusive To Relaxation  Bathroom Disappointing  Noisy Venting From Kitchen  General Claustrofobic Feeling To The Room.,,,,,
,2364,Digital Tv Did Misbehave A Bit.  I-Player Crashed Regularly Saying That Bandwidth Was An Issue,,,,,
,2366,A Bin In The Bedroom Area Would Have Been Useful. The Tv Menu Operation Was A Little Confusing.- The Turn Down Service Was Way Too Early (Sometimes Our Door Was Knocked About 6.30 As We Were Getting Ready For Dinner),,,,,
,2369,Our Room Was A Super Room Which Felt Really Super.,,,,,
,2370,On Hot Days It Would Be A Good Idea If The Turn Down Service Didn't Include Pulling Blinds And Curtains. Having Cooled Our Room Off During The Evening  We Returned From Dinner To A Furnace Again..........Not Very Conducive To Restful Sleep.,,,,,
,2372,Only Complaint Would Be The 2 Single Beds Bolted Together - Not Really Up To Par Considering The Cost Of The Room. Not Very Comfortable!,,,,,
,2375,Fridge Was Noise And Kept Me Awake But To Be Fair My Partner Slept,,,,,
,2377,The Room Was Lovely With Beautiful Views Of The Surrounding Areas.,,,,,
,2383,We Stayed In Ingle Tor Lodge. It Was Very Comfortable But The Carpets Were Quite Stained.,,,,,
,2387,The Internet Access Was Very Slow In The Lodges - However We Did Not Pay For The Faster Connection Package.,,,,,
,2390,Turning The Bed Down Needs Prior Notice. My Wife And I Were In Matrimonial Heaven When Your Man Opened The Door,,,,,
,2392,Glorious Views,,,,,
,2398,Room Was Very Comfortable  But Found Lighting In The Room Not Condjucive To Easy Reading.,,,,,
,2399,It Wasn't As Spacous As Described  And Bathrooms Need Updating,,,,,
,2401,The Wifi Internet Connection Was Very Poor - Substandard. As You Are Charging For Internet Usage  There Ought To Be A Hardwire Connection Available In Every Bedroom.,,,,,
,2404,The Shower Needs A Good Clean In The Bottom Corner  Some Pink Mould On The Tiles. Also A Window Was Cracked And The Wooden  Frame On The Window Needs Repairing/ Painting. Otherwise It Was Excellent.,,,,,
,2407,Bedrooms Were Very Warm  So Had To Have The Windows Open  A Thermostat On The Radiator Would Have Been Useful  And Would Save The Hotel Money In The Long Run As Heat Would Not Be Escaping Through The Open Windows.  Disappointed That No Chocolates Left On Second Night  Enjoyed The Fudge On The First Night And Was Looking Forward To It Again As A Treat Before Bed.,,,,,
,2409,Wifi Access Should Be Free Of Charge As With Many Other Hotels. People Do Not Really Feel This Should Be An Additional Cost,,,,,
,2410,Didn't Have Twin Room And As Apparently Only 1 Spare Twin Mattress This Had To Be Put In With The Existing Beds - So A Bit Of A Squash.We Were Affered A Spare Bed Which Turned Out To Be An Airbed - Not Appropriate As A Substitute - However Staff Then Brought The Mattress And Base - As All 6 Of Us Not There All Week It Was Ok But Would Have Been Difficult If They Were. Few Minor Hitches With Kitchen Equipment But Dealt With Promptly,,,,,
,2411,Wifi Should Be Complementary In This Level Of Hotel,,,,,
,2413,Odd Comment But When Lying On Bed Looking Up At Central Light The Glare Shade Was Dirty!,,,,,
,2414,The Volume On The Tv Was Set So Low That It Was Impossible To Hear.  Reception Could Not Help.,,,,,
,2417,We Were Given Room Number 9  This Faces Out Onto A Wall And Roof  Had I Been Aware Of This At The Time Of Booking As I Would Have Changed My Dates To Have Had A Room With A View As One Would Expext From A Luxury Establishment. On Arrival There Was Only One Dressing Gown In Room And I Had To Request Another Later That Evening. The Hair Dryer In The Room Did Not Work And It Took So Long To Get A Replacement  I Had To Go To Breakfast With Wet Hair. Following A Day On The Moor We Returned To Our Room Went To Make A Drink And The Milk In Fridge Had Not Been Replenished. ,,,,,
,2418,Bedrooms Were Rather Ordinary  A Bit 'Tired' Even...Below The Standard Of The Rest Of The Hotel. Charge For Internet At Â£5/Day Was Trivial -It Caused More Irritation To Me Than You Earnt. I Suggest You Simply Drop The Charge,,,,,
,2419,It Was Hot And Hard To Get The Temperature Down. With The Radiator Off And The Window Open After A Couple Of Hours It Got Better.  Bed Sdie Telephone Was Easy To Use Good Instructions But The Microphone Does Not Work  Callers Cannot Hear You. ( Room 55 ),,,,,
,2423,Clean  Comfortable  Cosy,,,,,
,2426,We Had A Few Minor Problems With Room  Ie Handle Of Bathroom Door Coming Off  Sink Blocked  But All Were Dealt With Immediately.,,,,,
,2427,The Room Was Clean But Rather Tired And The Only View Was Across Rooftops!,,,,,
,2429,I Do Not Think Internet Access Should Be Chargable.,,,,,
,2432,By 5.30Ish The Room Was Cold After Sitting A While  So We Asked Reception For A Heater. She Said Heating Would Be On Soon But Would Send Up A Heater. 45 Mins Later  Even Colder  I Went Down To Reception And Was Told A Heater Would Be Sent Up. One Arrived 10Mins Later. The Heating Hadn't Come On Before Going To Dinner And Wasn't On When We Returned Much Later In The Evening And Didn't Come On The Following Morning So We Were Grateful For The Portable Heater. We Had Checked The Thermostat Of Course!,,,,,
,2433,Perhaps The Overall Appeal Would Benefit From Some A Carpet Clean,,,,,
,2434,The Bedroom Door Needed A Firm Tug To Ensure It Locked. The Kettle Had A Very Short Lead Which Did Not Reach The Plug Socket From The Desk  Meaning That The Kettle Had To Be Boiled Whilst On The Floor. This Is Surely A Severe Health And Safety Hazard.,,,,,
,2435,Would Suggest Having A Light Near To The Mirror In The Room  It Was Quite Dark In This Area.  King Size Beds Are A Must. Very Noisy During The Late Afternoon/Evening With Door Banging  Not Sure It Was Other Guests  However Did Not Get Disturbed During The Night.,,,,,
,2437,It Didn't Affect Our Stay But We Felt The Bathroom Wasn't Quite As It Should Be  But Please Don't Think Their Is A Complaint In That Remark.,,,,,
,2438,Even With The Heating On It Was A Little Cold,,,,,
,2441,Next Time We Would Probably Up Grade To A Larger Room And Not On The 3 Rd Floor  But As We Were Only With You For 1 Night It Was Fine.,,,,,
,2443,We Stayed In A Lodge  Which Was Just Superb And Could Not Be Faulted. There Was A Jug Of Milk And A Welcome Pack To Greet Us  However It Would Have Been Nice To Have Been Provided With Milk For Tea During The Remainder Of Our Stay And For The Bathroom Products To Have Been Replenished.,,,,,
,2445,Please Let Me Know Name Of Matress. None Of Us Has Ever Slept In Such A Comfortable Bed.,,,,,
,2449,Room 19; The Rear Part Of The Room Was In Darkness; The Staff Found Us Another Lamp - Without Which We Could Not See To Make Tea/Coffee  Nor Could We See Into The Drawers. The Bed Is 6Ft6' Wide And Very Comfortable  But It Rather Overwhelms The Room Causing The Chairs & Table In Front Of The Window Ato Be Pretty 'Bunched Up' And It's Hard To Get To The Curtains. The Wriggle-Sided Purple Carpet Was A Nuisance As It Kept Creeping To Block The Main Door. Bathroom Is A Bit Bleak  With Nowhere To Set Down Personal Toiletries Etc. As The Little Glass/Metal Thing Was Already Busy With Towels And Stuff. The Basin Seems To Have A Blocked Drain.,,,,,
,2450,Whilst I Did Not Need Mobile Phone I Would Have Liked The Opportunity To Use It In The Lodge,,,,,
,2451,The Room Was Fine Apart From ... Two Window Stays Broken/Missing. Numerous Stains On Rug And Armchairs  Peeling Paint In Bathroom On Bath Panel And Skirting Board. Not What One Expects For The Price!,,,,,
,2454,Bathroom Was Too Small And Did Not Provide Much Room For Toiletries  Etc. Lighting In The Room Was Dismal At Best. Bulbs In Lamps Were Not Very Helpful. We Had A Major Problem Opening The Door From The Inside And Found The Handle Was Hard To Turn. The Internet Connection Was Outstanding And I Was Able To Use My I-Pad Effectively.,,,,,
,2456,The Tv System Seemed To Be Having Teething Troubles.  It Was Not Easy To Use And There Did Not Seem To Be Any Instructions.,,,,,
,2461,Had To Change Room As First Room Was Dark And Uninviting. Second Room Was Excellent But I Did Have To Pay A Supplement.,,,,,
,2462,Fantastic Views And Good Size Room.  Found The Duvet A Little Warm For Late Summer/Autumn Weather  But The Bed Was Extremely Comfortable.,,,,,
,2463,The Tv Was Very Slow And Sometimes Difficult To Get Programmes,,,,,
,2466,Room Was Fine But View Was A Drainpipe!,,,,,
,2467,Toilet Flush Broike And Despite Telling Reception When We Went To Breakfast Nothing Was Done,,,,,
,2468,We Did Move The Chairs And Occasional Table Round As We Do Like To Sit Having Morning Tea By The Window!,,,,,
,2473,There Was No Mini Bar,,,,,
,2476,Room Was Good  Bit Tatty And Cobwebs Visable.  ,,,,,
,2480,The First Room We Were Given It Needed A Lot Of Maintenance And You Could Be Seen By People Outside If You Were Using The Bathroom Facilities,,,,,
,2481,Excellent Housekeeping Service  Room Was Immaculately Clean,,,,,
,2483,Bathroom Looked A Little Tired  But Otherwise It Was Brilliang,,,,,
,2485,Lodge Water Tanks Are Not Large Enough So Half Of Us Had Cold Showers Each Morning.  Maintenance Were Called But Said It Was All Working Ok  We Should Just Wait 10Mins Between Showers!,,,,,
,2487,I Was Dissaopointed To Be Asked To Pay For An Internet Connection.,,,,,
,2489,The Bathroom Looked A Little Tired And Could Have Been Improved By Having A Bigger Bath And Fresher Dã©Cor.,,,,,
,2490,Beds Were Just Two Made Up Singles Pushed Together. Should Have Been A Double As We Were A Couple. We Had To Ask For This To Be Changed. The Milk In The Fridge Was Out Of Date.,,,,,
,2497,Simply Beautiful.,,,,,
,2501,Housekeeping Were Great And Deserve The Service Charges,,,,,
,2504,Would Have Been Good To Have Had Some Herbal Teas  Particularly Green Tea  Available.  Having Requested It On The First Night And Some Tea Bags Being Brought Up  It Would Have Been Excellent If More Were Made Available In The Room On The Second Day. Bathroom Products Didn't Feel Quite Up To The Standard Of The Luxury Of The Rest Of The Stay. Didn't Feel That Paying For Internet  Or Movies  Was Appropriate Given The Luxury Nature Of The Hotel - Would Be Better To Offer This For Free.,,,,,
,2506,We Chose To Upgrade Room To A Better View.,,,,,
,2508,We Changed Bedroom Due To Faulty Tv But Both Rooms Were Nicely Decorated And Furnished. Cleaning On The Whole Was Fine And Of No Concern To Us During Our Stay But In Need Of A Deep Clean In Places E.G. There Was A Lot Of Dust On The Light Shade.,,,,,
,2509,There Were Some Decorative Elements That Needed Updating - Stain On The Carpet  Peeling Wallpaper In The Bedroom,,,,,
,2510,The Door Handle Was Very Stiff  Broken Tiles In The Bathroom  The Blinds And Curtains Were Brown With Water Stains.,,,,,
,2511,Plug Was Not Ideal To Use Kettle As I Had To Use Kettle On The Floor. Room 22.,,,,,
,2512,Was Upgraded To Superior Castle But Felt It Wasn't The Standard Expected. There Was An Issue With The Plumbing  The Curtains Were Dirty And I Had To Request Clean Towels.,,,,,
,2513,On The Second Night  We Were Next To A Wedding Party. Our 4 Year Old Daughter Did Not Sleep Until 2Am  As We Were A Family We Should Either Of Been Placed In A Different Room Or Warned About The Disruption. To Be Honest It Ruined The Evening.,,,,,
,2514,The Bathroom Was A Little Tatty And The Room Was Extremely Hot.,,,,,
,2515,Wi-Fi Access Is Costly; One Would Expect Free Wi-Fi At Such A Place.,,,,,
,2516,Loved The Nursery Set Up.,,,,,
,2518,The Room Was Nice Enough  And If You Didn't Stay In Luxury Hotels Regularly It Would Probably Look Great. However  There Was Damp Patches On The Ceiling  Blinds In Bathroom Were Heavily Stained  Carpers Were Stained (In Some Communal Areas They Were Threadbare). The Lamps Next To Bed Were 'Cheap' Ikea Style Lamps And Generally Our 'Castle Valley Room' Wasn't Up To The 300-500 Price Tag Which Matches Hotels Like The Connaught  Triannon Palace In Versailles And Similar Level Hotels. The Room Wasn't Up To Those Standards. As I Say To Those 'Treating' Themselves To A Luxury Hotel They May Not Notice But If You Stay In Luxury Hotels Regularly Then You'd Notice The Issues.,,,,,
,2521,I Was Very Kindly Upgraded As It Was My Birthday - I Really Appreciated This.,,,,,
,2523,We Were Given A Disabled Bedroom - This Is Ok But We Would Appreciate If Told Earlier. As The Bathroom Only Had Shower (With No Glass Around It) And The Water Splashed Everyone When We Showered. Not Very Convenient.,,,,,
,2527,It Was Large And Spacious With A Very Comfy Bed.  No Issues With The Room.,,,,,
,2529,The Fixtures In The Bathroom Are Not 5 Star. Mouldy Grouting On The Tiles - Flush On The Toilet Barley Worked - Toilet Seat Slightly Loose - Overall The Bedroom Was Excellent But The Bathroom Had The Feel Of A 3/4 Star Hotel And Not Consistent With The Finish Elsewhere Or The Price,,,,,
,2530,Free Internet Very Slow.  Room Was Nice Enough  But Paint Starting To Peel Off In Places On Ceiling  A Light Bulk Didn't Work On Desk Lamp  And The Bathroom Generally Was Not What We Would Have Expected (Yellowing Grout Etc),,,,,
,2531,Very Yellow Bath Water..It Would Have Been Nice To Have Been Told To Expect This And That It Was Normal,,,,,
,2532,I Don't Understand Why Hotels Make Guests Pay Even A Nominal Sum For Wifi Connection These Days. It Should Be Standard At No Extra Cost. Otherwise It's Just Hassle And Petty. Charge A Bit More For The Room If You Have To.,,,,,
,2535,The Room We Stayed In Was Amazing  The View Was Fantastic And We Were Greatful For The Room We Recieved. Just One Little Comment About The Pillows  They Were A Little Hard/Firm For My Partner And Found It A Bit Uncomfortable.   ,,,,,
,2536,Lovely And Quiet.  Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,2538,The Bedroom Itself Was Very Clean Although We Felt The Furniture Was Very Dated - Scorch Rings On The Bedside Tables Etc.  The Bathroom Was Very Basic And Not What I Would Call Luxurious.  The Shower Was Over The Bath And Not Very Powerful And The Tap On The Basic Span Around Which In Turn Led To A Dripping Of Water Onto The Bathroom Carpet Which Was Not Ideal.,,,,,
,2539,It Was All Lovely. Our Only Negative Comment Would Be That Our Room Was Very Close To The Entry Of The Bistro So We Could Hear More Noise Than We Expected At A 5 Star Hotel.,,,,,
,2540,The Bath And Tap Water Was Dark Green In Colour. Advised By Reception That This Is Normal When It Rains And All Bedrooms Were The Same. We Were Disappointed Not To  Be Able To Make Use Of The Bath During Our Stay.,,,,,
,2543,Guests Should Not Be Asked To Pay For Internet Access. This Is A High Quality Hotel And That Smacked A Bit Of Something An Easyjet Hotel Would Ask! Given The Room Rates  This Should Be Provided To Guests And No Extra Costs,,,,,
,2544,Possibly Do With Larger Bottles Of Water And Free Wi-Fi?,,,,,
,2546,The Tap Was Wobbly In The Sink  The Curtains Were Damp Stained,,,,,
,2547,The Hot Chocolate Was A Bit Plain  But Otherwise All The Other Bits And Bobs Were Lovely.,,,,,
,2550,It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Shelf Or Cabinet In The Bath For Storage.,,,,,
,2551,The Windows Leaked Badly (But It Did Rain Heavily!),,,,,
,2553,One Or Two Small Problems Which Were Very Quickly Resolved.,,,,,
,2555,Bathroom Requires Extractor Ventilation As Slow To Clear Steam And Condensation. Bedroom Slow To Warm. Bin Required In Room For Tea Maker.,,,,,
,2557,What Happened To The Fruit And Nuts??,,,,,
,2558,Our Room No35 Was Rather Tired  The Bathroom Needed Refurbishment  There Was Water Stains On The Walls Around The Shower.  The Whole Room And Bathroom Were Not The Standard Of A Five Star Hotel.,,,,,
,2559,We Were On A Lodge So I Have Answered These Questions As If It Was The Lodge.  Some Face Towels And An Umbrella Would Have B Een Helpful,,,,,
,2560,Initial Room Had View Of Tiled Roof Therefore Was Offered Upgrade Which Came At £60.00 Per Night! Asked If This Was Negotiable And Was Told 'No'. Very Disappointed As The Original Room Had No View  And As Hotel Was No Where Near Full I Feel We Could Have Been Accommodated More Satisfactory.,,,,,
,2562,The Only Missing Ingredient Was A Nespresso Machine Or Similar,,,,,
,2564,Very Small- Not A 5 Star Bedroom. Paintwork Tired. Carpets On Stairs Leading To Bedroom Threadbare And Stained. The Duvet Was Far Too Hot.,,,,,
,2565,No Fridge; No Safe,,,,,
,2567,Dated  Damp Stains Above Skirting In Bathroom  Floorboards Moved And Were Noisy When Anyone Walked Past Room Bed Too Small And Far Too Soft.Have Had Far Better Rooms At Much Less Cost.,,,,,
,2569,Thought I Might Have Got An Upgrade Booked 2Rooms My Extra Bills Was £700 Plus Pounds,,,,,
,2570,The Safe Was Inoperative - No Power But Not A Problem For One Night.  Reported To The Desk On Check Out.  Socket For Kettle Tricky To Find And Its Lead Almost Too Short To Reach To Window Ledge - Poss Unsafe.  The Bathroom  Thought Spotless And Well Equipped Is A Little Tired For A Hotel Of Your Quality But It Must Be Difficult To Update Given The Layout.,,,,,
,2573,The 4Ft6 Double Bed Was Unexpected And Smaller Than We Are Used Too. We Thought That For The Price It Could Have Been Larger!  Used The Internet Access On The Gallery. (Not In The Room),,,,,
,2575,No,,,,,
,2576,Bathroom In Rm 41 Was A Little Tired. Bathroom Panel Poorly Fixed.,,,,,
,2578,My Room Was Very Noisey At Night Time( Number 11) And Was Cold In The First Night .,,,,,
,2579,We Have A Much Wider Bed At Home And Also It Was Very High. We Were Disappointed Not To Have A View - We Looked Over The Roofs!,,,,,
,2580,The Room Was Extremely Hot And I Was Unable To Get To The Window To Open It  Although I Think The Very Heavy Curtains Would Have Prevented Any Cool Air Entering The Room. It Appeared That Two Beds Were Joined Together And This Gave A Hard Ridge Down The Middle. As A Disabled Person I Think Single Beds Would Have Been More Appropriate.,,,,,
,2581,Just Fantastic,,,,,
,2583,Room 55 - Wardrobe In Bathroom Very High And Difficult To Access Tv Sound Wouldn't Go Past 75  Despite Tv Being Changed,,,,,
,2585,Lodge Needs Some Basic Maintenance Work Such As Draught Proofing Around The Doors Blind In Master Bedroom Did Not Work.Back Door Key Very Difficult To Turn And In Danger Of Breaking .Paintwork Showing Some Obvious Signs Of Wear And Tear.Non Existent Supply Of Kitchen Cleaning Items Particularly With Regard To The Hob And Work Surfaces Making It Very Hard To Maintain Cleanliness Whilst Staying In Lodge. No Double Glazing In Bathroom Made It Very Cold As Window Directly Above Bath And Would Be A Possible Problem In The Colder Months With  Families With Young Children Who Wanted To Use The Actual Bath. Overall This Is A Delightful Cottage So Long As General Maintenance And Decoration Are Maintained In The Future Months As Also Outside It Was Evident That Gutters Blocked And Subsequent Overflow Of Water Starting To Deteriorate The Elegant Stonework.,,,,,
,2586,I Did Not Like The Outlook To My Room. Did Comment On That To The Reception Several Times But No One Suggested To Change My Room.,,,,,
,2588,Last Two Items Not Used,,,,,
,2591,Bed Too Soft.,,,,,
,2594,As We Had Taken Advantage Of A Special Offer  I Suppose That We Could Not Expect A 'Good' Room But As The Hotel Had Low Occupation  Maybe A Better Room Would Have Been A Valuable 'Loss-Leader' In Tempting Us Back? We Have Used A Number Of Travelzoo Offers In The Past Year And It Is The First Time We Have Experienced The 'Below The Salt' Attitude. An Opportunity Missed We Think.,,,,,
,2595,The Out Side Of Our Lodge Should Have Been Cleaned.  There Were Bird Droppings Excessive Outside On A Ledge From A Next.  Also On Inside Of One Window.,,,,,
,2598,Our Room Overlooked The Rear Courtyard Which Was Very Noisy Particularly Early In The Morning. We Were However Moved To Room 8 For The Second Night Which Was Very Nice And Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,2601,In View Of The Unusual Warm Weather During Out Stay  It Would Have Helped To Have A Lighter Duvet Or Choice Of A Blanket As It Was Much Too Hot At Night.,,,,,
,2602,Access To The Internet Was Unnecessarily Complicated  Involving Codes And Passwords Etc  All To Charge A Few Pounds For Access. Given The Average Cost Of Rooms At Bovey Castle  I Would Expect You To Provide Free Internet In Line With Other Hotels Of The Same Standard Elsewhere.,,,,,
,2605,Bathroom Had Stains On Wall And Needed Decorating,,,,,
,2610,In Our Lodge We Had No Internet Connection  Regardless Of What You Said,,,,,
,2614,All Ready Mentioned In My Previous Comments,,,,,
,2616,Internet Connection Should Be Free For This Grade Of Room  Paintwork Needs Cleaning.,,,,,
,2618,Carpets Badly Stained-Not Nice,,,,,
,2619,The Lighting Was Too Poor To Be Able To Work At The Desk.  The Charges For Internet Access Were Excessive.  The Room Overlooked A Busy And Noisy Car Park. We Were Kept Awake Throughout The Night By What Sounded Like Someone Moving/Scaping Furniture Across A Wooden Floor  Interspersed By The Odd Bang.  This Continued From 11.30 Hrs Until 06.30 Hrs And Is Not The Way To Treat Guests Staying In What Was Portrayed As A 5 Star Hotel. We Have Never Before Experienced Such A Sleep-Deprived Night And Will Never Return. We Will Also Be Complaining To Secret Escapes To Inform Them Of The Type Of Room Their Customers Can Expect From You.,,,,,
,2621,View Over The Roof Not Very Appealing,,,,,
,2622,During Our Stay The Room Was Very Warm At Night & We Could Not Find A Way Of Opening A Window. Also The Bed Was Too Soft & There Was No Choice Of Firmer Pillows.,,,,,
,2623,No,,,,,
,2625,Toilet Seat Would Not Stay Up Due To Flush Handle In Way,,,,,
,2628,A View Would Have Been Preferable.,,,,,
,2635,Rooms Too Hot Esp. At Night-Consistent Fault Of All English Hotels We Stayed At Over A Month; Also Duvet/Doona Too Thick And Heavy And Did Not Cover The Edges Of Bed   So Half Body Too Hot And Other Half Too Cold- Also Consistent Fault Across All Hotels In England- Should Have Option To Use Sheet Anew Blanket Or Thinner Duvet But Wider. Toilet Did Not Flush Properly- Should Not Occur In High Class Hotel!,,,,,
,2636,I Needed A Bigger Waste Paper Basket Than The Tiny Ine In The Bathroom!,,,,,
,2637,The Bed Was Wonderful. Bedside Lamp Did Not Work. Toilet Seat Loose. Bath Tap Loose. Intermediate Door Off Bottom Hinge. However  The Upgrade And View Was Very Much Appreciated. A Great Stay !!,,,,,
,2639,The Wardrobe With A Silly Hanging Arrangement Was Silly. Why Do Hotels Use Those Silly Pots Of Milk That No One Likes?,,,,,
,2640,The Views Were Exceptional,,,,,
,2642,It Was A Corner Position With The Only View Being The Car Park And An End Wall. An Extractor Fan For The Kitchen Was Running Continuously Throughout The Night And We Had To Have The Window Open To Gain Some Air. This Meant We Had Difficulty In Sleeping.,,,,,
,2647,The Shower Room Was Poor; There Was Nowhere In The Shower To Put My Shampoo  Soap Etc Except On The Floor. The Blind In The Bathroom Had To Be Pulled Down When The Toilet Was Used Otherwise One Would Be In Full View From The Window.,,,,,
,2648,Had I Known That The Internet Was Free Of Charge I Would Have Made Better Use Of It. The Comfort And Functionality Of The Bedroom And Bathroom Were Fine But The Décor Was Scruffy Rather Than Shabby In Parts.,,,,,
,2651,Too Small Not Like Website Photos.,,,,,
,2653,It Was In Need Of A Facelift Particularly The Bathroom,,,,,
,2654,For A Hotel Of This Standard Wi-Fi Access Should Be Free As With Most Hotels,,,,,
,2659,Not Enough Shelves In The En-Suite  Nor Any Hook For Your Bath Towel When Showering. The Method Of Obtaining A Cup Of Coffee In The Room (The 'Hang-On-The-Side Sachets) Maybe Novel  But Really Awkward  And To Be Honest  The Taste Was Horrible - Nothing Like Real Coffee.,,,,,
,2662,There Was Only One Small Bar Of Soap. There Was Only On Dressing Gown. The Light Above The Sink Was Faulty And Only One Bulb Worked./,,,,,
,2663,We Had G2 With The Entry Level Into Lounge Perfect For Us Only Needing To Access Bedrooms On One Level Suited Us.,,,,,
,2667,We Were Given 29 There Was A Noise From A Chimney Or Ventilator That Started At 0600 In The Morning We Tried To Sleep In But The Noise Was Too Annoying. The Mains Water Was Brown There Was No Explanation Of This When We Arrived  We Assumed It Was Safe To Drink But Cannot Understand Why It Was So Brown. ,,,,,
,2669,There Was A Lound Banging Noise On And Off At About 06.30Hrs Which Lasted For About 10 Bangs  Sounded Like The Water Pipes. The Handle On The Bath Does Not Allow The Shower Screen To Fit Comfortably On The Bath  Consequently The Floor Gets Wet.,,,,,
,2670,In-Room Internet With The Hotel Access Code Did Not Work Very Well  On One Or Two Days Not At All. Also On Arrival  It Was Not Made Clear That There Is No Mobile Connectivity Except -We Found Out Later By Chance- In The Cafeteria.  ,,,,,
,2671,We Stayed In Room 36 And Several Times We Had A Very Strong Smell Of Petrol Coming Through The Open Window,,,,,
,2674,Pokey Dirty Half Used Amenities Left In Shower  Used Toilet Roll Centre Left On Floor. Very Hot???,,,,,
,2676,The Sofas In Claret Tor Looked Impressive But Were Actually Not Particularly Comfortable To Sit On For Any Length Of Time.,,,,,
,2681,The Bed Was Extremely Comfortable. (The Most Comfortable Of Any Hotel I've Stayed In). Would Have Liked Tumblers For Water In The Bathroom.,,,,,
,2682,The Ladies Were Pleasent And Efficient In Caring For Our Room,,,,,
,2683,Re The Above - We Were Happier Once We Were Moved From Room 11,,,,,
,2684,First Room We Were Given Was Blighted By The Noise Of The Kitchen Extractor Fans. We Moved To Another Room Albeit The Second Room Was Not As Good As The First (But It Was Quiet),,,,,
,2685,Carpets Had Quite A Few Stains.  Only 2 Wine Glasses And 4 Champagne Glasses.  Lack Of Serving Dishes.,,,,,
,2686,Good Drainpipe View,,,,,
,2687,Big Suite Was Very Nice.,,,,,
,2689,Only 'Failure' Hot Rail In Bathroom Didn't Work  & Reported It Without Success.,,,,,
,2694,The Room Seemed To Be Tired With Regard To Decor. There Was A Problem With The Sink As Water Could Not Drain Away Easily And Also It Was Cracked.,,,,,
,2695,The Room Was Very Cramped Inasmuch As You Couldn't Open The Cupboard Door And Walk Around So One Person Had To Slide Out To Let The Other In. Also If One Was Sitting At The Dressing Table The Other Person Was Penned Into The Window Area. For The Price I Can Honestly Say It Is Very Bijou!,,,,,
,2698,The View Was Beautiful And The Bedroom Very Comfortable. There Could Have Been More Shower Gel In The Bathroom,,,,,
,2700,Water From The Hot Tap In The Bath Was Very Brown.  Not Really Appealing  Even In Dartmoor,,,,,
,2703,We Were Given A Winter Quilt And My Wife Could Not Sleep Under It And Ended Sleeping Under Her Dressong Gown  Not Good.,,,,,
,2704,The Bed Was Too Soft. The Internet Connection Was Extremely Slow  Hitch Was Frustrating As We Had To Do Some Work Emails And It Took Longer Than Necessary To Connect And Download Them.,,,,,
,2705,Tv In Bedrooms,,,,,
,2707,G2 Looking A Little Tired In Places  Couldn't Get Washing Machine To Work And Missing A Frying Pan.,,,,,
,2708,Needed Updating  The Bathroom,,,,,
,2711,It Was Small And There Was No Mirror With A 3Pin Plug Close So I Had To Dry My Hair 'Blind'  In Fact The Decor In The Room Was Pretty Mediocre. The Bathroom Needed Updating,,,,,
,2712,Bathroom Was Tired To Say The Least And Required Redecorating,,,,,
,2713,The Wifi Facility Was Rubbish! It Might Have Only Been £1 Per Hour  But It Kept Failing And The Last Time I Used It It Never Connected. A Complete Waste Of Time.,,,,,
,2715,Shabby  No Fridge No Music System  Cracked China In Room(Tea Cup) Tea Went All Down Me On Sat Morning   Left In Saucer   Same Cup Returned When Room Serviced  So Could Not Use It!!!,,,,,
,2716,The Bedroom Was Clean  Comfortable And To A Reasonable Standard Of Decoration,,,,,
,2718,We Did Not In The First Instance Get Allocated A Room On The Side Of The Hotel That We Had Originally Selected With Leanne  However This Was Speedily Rectified By Frederico When We Raised The Matter,,,,,
,2720,Some Of The Stairs To The Lower Ground In Claret Tor Were Marked With Mud (Or Similar) On Arrival And Thereafter.,,,,,
,2723,Suite Was Smaller Than Expected,,,,,
,2724,Bathroom Needed Softer Lighting,,,,,
,2725,Bathroom Was Shabby,,,,,
,2727,We Spent 1 Night In Arch Tor.  It Smelled Of Insect Repellent  Which Housekeeping Claimed Was Exhaust From The Boiler - It Was Insect Repellent.  The Unit Was Tired And Worn - Carpets Stained  Furniture Soiled.  We Were Moved To Eleswood Rock.  It Was An Improvement  But Still Tired And Worn - The Couches In Particular Were Soiled.  Housekeeping Was Bad.  Kitchen Garbage Was Not Removed  Coffee Grounds Left In Coffee-Maker  Floor Not Washed  Dust  Cobwebs And Dog Hair Under Tables.  Worst Was Old Food Still On Pots And Pans That Were Supposedly Clean - Disgusting.,,,,,
,2728,The Bathroom Was Rather 'Tired' !!  And A King Size Bed Would Have Been Preferable But Apart From That We Were Very Happy With Everything.,,,,,
,2730,Room Was Very Comfortable But I Did Not Feel That The Furnishings Were Up To The Standard Of The Hotel Generaly  Especially Considering The Room Rate. Tv Interface Very Difficult To Use. Nice Touches Re: Dog Facilities.,,,,,
,2734,The Bathroom Was Small Tired And Old Not What I Would Expect In A Hotel Of This Standard,,,,,
,2735,Would Of Preferred A Bath Than Shower.,,,,,
,2737,Was Disappointed As 'Superior' Room  Booked Was Not As Online Picture- We Felt It To Be A More Standard Room.  The Bed Was Too Small  As I Was Sharing With My Daughter  We Would Have Liked Twin Beds But Understood This Was Not Available.However The Problem Was Quickly Solved And Offered A Larger Room With A King Size Bed ( As Seen Online) For This Type Of Booking. We Were Satisfied With This,,,,,
,2740,The Cottage Was A Bit 'Tired'. The Second Stair Gate Was Broken And When Mentioned To Reception We Were Told It Wouldn't Be Able To Be Fixed. Which Was A Shame,,,,,
,2741,Carpet In Sitting Room A Bit Tierd,,,,,
,2744,The Room We Were In Was Next To The Bistro And You Could Hear A Constant Generator Sound.,,,,,
,2745,Would Have Liked An Upgrade But It Was A Very Busy Time For You And We Had A Lovely Garden View,,,,,
,2746,Room Was Nice But It Was Very Hot  I Asked Twice At Main Desk For A Fan But Was Told None Were Available  The Weather Was Very Hot That Week  We Were In Room 3 Over The Swimming Pool  The Noise Of The Extractor Fan Going All Night  Kept Us Awake  & The Next Morning We Had A Long Car Journey To Make So Not Ideal.,,,,,
,2749,Superior Room Booked Was Not Up To Expectation As Viewed Online  Bed Was Small Would Have Liked Two Single Beds  However We Were Offered A Different Room With A King Size Bed Which Was Adequate  But Still Was Not As Viewed Online  But Otherwise Ok,,,,,
,2752,Just The Fact That We Weren't Offered An Upgrade For Our Special Occasion.,,,,,
,2753,Lovely Fresh Water And Coffee Etc Everyday And Nice To Have Our Bed Turned Down At Night,,,,,
,2754,Didn't Like Coffee Bags. Very Fiddly! Also  Paid For Room With A View So I Wasn't Very Impressed With The Views From Room 11  The Roof And Another Building.,,,,,
,2755,Beautiful View. Just A Shame As Previously Mentioned That Due To The Delay Getting Our Key It Was Dark And We Couldn't See It Until The Morning.  The Milk In The Fridge Was In Date But When My Husband Poured It Into His Coffee It Split.,,,,,
,2762,The Room Was Clean And Nicely Decorated But Let Down By A Large Patch Of Damp On The Ceiling.,,,,,
,2766,Only Improvement To Lodge Would Be (1) Blackout Blind On Side Small Window In Bedrooms  (2) Soundproofing Of Boiler,,,,,
,2770,The Internet Access Was Easy To Set Up With One Device  But Not For 2 And No Instructions Were Given How To Do This.,,,,,
,2772,The Armoire Was A Little Small As We Had Been Travelling For A Month And Had A Lot Of Luggage.,,,,,
,2775,Shabby No Fridge  Poor Silly Toiletries  Luxury Hotels Have Full Size Or At Least Half Size Products  Bathroom Needed A Refit Wallpaper Stained!,,,,,
,2777,There Was Not An Operational Working Tv In My Room  The Method Of Coffee Making With Filter System Was Poor  Hardly Easy To Use  Surely A Better Coffee Making System Should Be Available..,,,,,
,2778,Cleaning Crew Didn't Speak English Very Well So It Was Difficult To Communicate With Them,,,,,
,2779,Room 55  Wardrobe In Bathroom A Little Inaccessible! No Milk With Teas  Coffees. Did Ring For Some. Tv Sound Limited To 75 Maintenance Changed Tv But Same On New One.,,,,,
,2782,The Windows Leaked Badly,,,,,
,2784,We Didn't Think It Was Necessary To Give Us Clean Towels Every Time We Used Them - Only With You For One Night,,,,,
,2786,Would Have Preferred A Bath  And Not To Be On The Main Corridor And Overlooking The Entrance.  Was Not Very Private Or Quiet.,,,,,
,2787,Our Bedroom (24) Had A Very Dirty Bedspread  A Stained Lamp Shade On The Standard Lamp And Stains On The Sofa,,,,,
,2792,Finding A Socket For The Kettle Was Poor I Had To Place It On The Floor. The Door Lock Needed Lubricating. The Towel Rail In The Bathroom Did Not Work. The Grouting On The Bath Tiles Was Imaculate,,,,,
,2793,Small Bed,,,,,
,2794,The Room If Really Honest I Felt Was A Little Tired In Terms Of It's Condition Rather Than Choice Of Decor.  It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Shower Cubicle Though I Accept Bathroom Space Is At A Premium In These Older Buildings.,,,,,
,2795,First Room Did Not Meet Our Expectations However The Room We Settled On Was Fantastic And Met All Expectations.  Internet However Was Horrible!  It Was Not Until My Last Day That I Realised I Could Pay For 'Better' Internet.  You Have Limited The 'Free' Internet By So Much That It Is Truly Not Useable!  If You Dont Want People To Use The 'Free' Internet Just Get Rid Of The Option And Leave The 5Gbp Charge.  This Is Such A Small Charge I Can Not Imagine Anyone Complaining About It.,,,,,
,2796,Bathroom Needed An Update In Places,,,,,
,2797,Please Above Regarding The High Level Of Noise From The Kitchen.,,,,,
,2798,The Room Proportions Are Great And We Were Offered A Lovely Room 49.  I Didn't Get The Impression Anyone With An Eye For Detail Had Prepared The Place - Cushions And Sofas A Little Too Lived In Looking.  Also  Pictures Have Not Been Hung Straight - Who In Their Right Minds Would Not Have Corrected This Already??   I Was Amazed To Return To The Room One Morning And Find That The Baby's Cot Had Not Even Had The Blanket Folded  Crumbs Still On The Highchair Table.  Does Anyone Actually Care About The Guest Experience At Bovey Castle?,,,,,
,2799,A Lovely Room,,,,,
,2801,No Bathrobes. Poor Shower. Expected Room To Be Slightly Larger.,,,,,
,2802,The Cleanliness Leaved Much To Be Desired.  My Sheets Were Never Changed Over Three Nights Despite Being Obviously Creased And Soiled.  The Bathrobes Were Horrible.  I Don't If They Were Clean  They Were Certainly Ripped And Stained.,,,,,
,2803,We Could Not Watch The Television Due To Poor Signal  This Was Reported But No Feedback Given As To Wether The Problem Had Been Investigated/Resolved.,,,,,
,2805,Already Shared Them In Prior Comments,,,,,
,2806,Corner Suite Light Airy And Comftable  A Pleasing Upgrade To In The Past,,,,,
,2807,Very Comfortable,,,,,
,2809,No Mirro Near A Plug Inorder To Blow Dry Hair,,,,,
,2812,Windows ~ Locking Mechanism Could Be Better.,,,,,
,2815,No Dressing Gowns Provided. Tv Reception Poor.,,,,,
,2816,We Paid For An Upgrade On Arrival  And Were So Pleased That We Did! A Beautifully Appointed Large Room With Superb Views Of The Hotel Grounds. The Shower Screen Was Pretty Ineffectual - Leaked Through The Bottom Seal On The Bath Edge And Screen Not Long Enough Along The Bath Edge To Stop The Spray Onto The Bathroom Floor.,,,,,
,2817,Having Upgraded  The Comfort And Views Certainly Enhanced The Stay,,,,,
,2818,Although We Did Not Feel The Need To Complain We Found The Bathroom Very Cold Due To Drafty Windows There Was No Heating In The Bathroom Other Than A Towel Warmer Which Was Luke Warm This Prevented Us Relaxing In A Bath.The Desk Light Also Did Not Work.These Problems May Sound Minor But Not What We Expected From A Five Star Hotel.,,,,,
,2819,In View Of The Unusual Warm Week  It Would Have Been More Comfortable To Have Lighter Duvet Or Alternative Blankets.,,,,,
,2820,There Was Mold On The Walls.  There Were 2 Attempts To Deliver Our Luggage. Bathrobes Were Missing.,,,,,
,2821,Room 2 .....Left Side Mattress Saggy And Not Comfortable. Put Us Off Spending An Extra Night With You.,,,,,
,2825,Woodwork Around Windon Slightly 'Tatty'. I Know It Is An Old Building  Though As The Rest Of The Suite Was Presented Beautifully My Eye Unfortunately Was Drawn To The Window Frame (Though I Have To Say This Is My Only Gripe Which Is Pretty Insignificant Really!).,,,,,
,2827,I Thought It A Little Strange That Free Wifi Was Not Provided By The Hotel . In An Attempt To Use 3G Connections And Mobile Phones The Signal In This Area Was Not Strong Enough To Do Either Successfully.,,,,,
,2829,The Shower Should We Feel Should Be Separate To The Bath  No Bath Mat So If You Were A Little Unsteady You Could Slip! I Asked Housekeeping For 2 Feather Pillows - And These Were Given To Us.  Thank You!,,,,,
,2832,The Two Chairs Could Have Been Large And More Cosy.,,,,,
,2833,No,,,,,
,2834,We Were Surprised And Disappointed That Given The Poor Mobile Reception And The Cost Of The Hotel That We Had To Pay For Wifi!,,,,,
,2839,V Small With Small Bed,,,,,
,2841,The Bedroom Decor Was A Bit Disappointing. The Bathroom Carpet Was Not Nice  There Were Water Stains On The Wallpaper  It Was Not Appropriate To Have A Bath Over Shower As The Sides Of The Bath Were High. The Shower Was Rubbish.,,,,,
,2842,When We Arrived Our Bedroom Was Very Cold  We Asked For Some Other Kind Of Heating As The Radiator Was Out Of Order. Thankfully The Porter Brought Us A Convector Heater.,,,,,
,2843,It Was A Very Pleasant Room Indeed.  However  Being Woken On Sunday Morning At 6.45 A.M. Because Of A Loud Chorus Of Golfers Dropping Themselves And Their Cars Off Was A Long Way Off A Lie In!!  On Sunday Evening Having Returned From The Wedding  I Put The Do Not Disturb Sign Up And One Of The Staff Came And Knocked On The Door!!  She Insisted I Had Asked For A European Plug. She Was Quite Insistent For A Time As The Message Had Come From Reception!  When I Finally Managed To Convince Her That I Was English And In No Need For A European Plug She Left.  I Also Discovered That My Bed Sheets And Pillows Had Not Been Smoothed Out From The Night Before But  To All Intents And Purposes The Bed Looked Well Made.  In The Bathroom  The Bins Had Not Been Emptied But I Did Have Fresh Towels.,,,,,
,2845,Inadequate Lighting By Mirrors For Doing Hair And Make-Up And No Spare  Accessible Sockets Nearby For Hair Drier/Stylers,,,,,
,2846,We Stayed In Room 13 - Which Is Nice But It Does Need A Little Redecoration.  Carpets Generally Were Soiled  Especially In The Hallway And Landing Areas.,,,,,
,2847,We Were Disturbed Late At Night And Early In The Morning By The Very Loud Cooker Extraction Systems A Pity As The Room Itself Was Superb. We Thought Were In This Room Because We Were On A Special Promotion?,,,,,
,2848,We Asked For 2 Twins And 1 Double  But 2 Twins Not Available Nd As There Was Apparently On;Y 1 Spare Twim Mattress We Ended Up With Hat Being Put In One Of The Bedrooms - So Less Space Than Expected. We Were Offered A Spare Bed Rather Than A Mattress But That Turned Out To Be An Airbed Which I Thought Was N't An Adequate Solution. Also Although The Showers Were Great  The Shower Screen Didn't Extend Far Enough Along Bath Edge So Water Sprayed On Bathroom Floor,,,,,
,2850,We Were Given Room Number 9  Which Faces Out Onto A Wall And Roof Top   Had I Been Aware Of This At The Time Of Booking I Would Have Changed My Dates To Have Had A Room With A View.  This Was A Big Dissapointment For A Luxury Break  On Arrival There Was Only One Dressing Gown In Room And I Had To Request Another Later That Evening. ,,,,,
,2852,I Think You Do Yourselves A Diservice On Your Web Site By Saying That The 'Classic' Room May Have 'Imperfections'.   As It Is The Cheapest That You Have  One Cannot Expect It To Have The Views Or Size Of The Upgraded Ones.   We Found It Very Comfortable And Without 'Imperfections'   .....  Except The Pillows Were Very Hard.  Since Two Were Provided Per Person  One Should Be Softer.,,,,,
,2854,The Bedroom Was Lovely But We Were Near The Wooden Stairs Which Was Very Noisy And We Had No Fridge. We Were Asked To Be Moved The Next Day And That Was Handled Well By The Reception Staff. It Took Us A While To Get Moved Though Because The Room Wasn't Ready Until 4Pm,,,,,
,2855,We Received An Upgrade To A Junior Suite Which Was Great,,,,,
,2856,I Loved That There Were Rooms For Singles  But They Could Use To Be Spruced Up A Bit.,,,,,
,2857,Decor Seemed Tired,,,,,
,2858,The Room Was Clean But Not To A High Standard Of A Five Star Hotel. The Safety Was Adequate  The Bed Was Not Wide Enough And The Sheets Were Clean But Worn. The Lighting Was Very Poor For Reading.,,,,,
,2861,No Hooks For Coats It Was A Lodge - Not Enough Glasses - Only 4 Champagne Glasses  Bathroom Humidifier Didn't Work Downstairs  One Of The Rooms Not Terribly Clean. Stair Floor Stained. Not Enough Bathroom Products,,,,,
,2863,Would Have Liked More Comfortable Chairs To Relax In And A Better View,,,,,
,2864,To Hot !,,,,,
,2866,They Could Do With Being Refreshed,,,,,
,2868,The Lodge Was Very Impressive And The Welcome Pack Was A Lovely Surprise.,,,,,
,2869,One Small Point There Were Finger Marks On The Door To The Bedroom  Probably From Newsprint (Not Ours!),,,,,
,2870,Small Stain On The Headboard.,,,,,
,2871,Re Bath  Shower  Basin - The Brown Water Took A Little Time To Get Use To!,,,,,
,2873,View Over A Roof Was Rather Dissapointing!,,,,,
,2874,Not 5 Star Standard Like Other Hotels We Have Stayed At Like Whatley Manor More Like A 3 Star,,,,,
,2875,Kettle Wire Too Short ! Bed And Pillows Extremely Comfortable !,,,,,
,2876,I Am A Bit Of A Coffee Freak So Would Appreciate More Complimentary Coffee And Less Tea,,,,,
,2879,Had To Go Through Fire Door Into Adjoining Lobby To Access Bathroom And Could Not Leave Bedroom Door Open As Noise Could Travel To Adjoining Room Via Lobby,,,,,
,2881,Initial Disappointment At The Standard Of Room Given Was Quickly Overcome With The Allocation Of Another Much Better Room.,,,,,
,2884,Some Scuff Marks In Room Which You Wouldn't Expect At Such An Establishment.,,,,,
,2885,N/A,,,,,
,2886,We Were Given A Complimentary Upgrade Upon Arrival  Which Was Very Kind And Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,2891,It Was A Shame There Was No Fridge In This Standard Of Room,,,,,
,2895,No,,,,,
,2905,Very Pleasent,,,,,
,2909,The Room Had A Beautiful View,,,,,
,2912,Some Chipped Paintwork,,,,,
,2943,Only That The Bathroom Wold Have Been Nice If It Had A More Impressive Bath  Ie A Free Standing Or Roll Top One In Keeping With The Design  Especially As There Was Space. Also  On Rnning The Bath The Water Was A Strange Greeny Yellow Color.,,,,,
,2958,My Room Was Upgraded But I Still Felt The Bathroom Was Very Poor And Not Of The Standard I'd Expect For A Room Costing £350+! The Shower Was Hopeless  No Water Pressure  The Decor Dated. I Would Expect This Standard In A B&B,,,,,
,2959,My Room Was Pink.Lol.,,,,,
,2974,Tv Was Set To A Timed Lock Out. Which Meant That We Missed The Final Stage Of The Mixed Doubles Final Of The Olympic Tennis Final. Disappointing To Say The Least.,,,,,
,2985,It Was Overly Warm To Sleep.  Opening Window Made Noise From Generator Outside Too Loud. Loose Floorboard Made A Bang Each Time I Sat On The End Of The Bed. There Was A Regular Banging Sound From The Floor Below  Like A Swinging Door  Which Was Annoying When I Was Trying To Sleep. Just Trying To Get A Tv Channel On Was Overly Complicated - I Just Gave Up Trying At One Point. Two Tiny Milk Capsules Were All That Were Provided - Barely To Enough For Just One Cup Of Coffee. I Brought A Sugar Bowl Up To The Room And Would Have Liked A Fridge To Chill Some Fresh Milk/Water. The Cups Were Particularly Nice And The Beds Very Comfortable,,,,,
,2996,Ourr Room Was Very Noisey At Nigrt Time.,,,,,
,3002,The Air Condition Units Were Noisy,,,,,
,3003,The Bathroom Was Poor - Bath Had Chip In It And Was Small,,,,,
,3009,The Internet Speed Was Very Very Slow In Room 42 The Internet Should Also Be Free.,,,,,
,3023,I  Needed A Larger Waste Paper Basket In The Room . The One In Bathroom Was Not Enough.,,,,,
,3025,Loved The Large Bathroom  Loved The Large Space And Bedroom Decor  Totally Suited To Hotel & Surroundings. I Would Have Liked A Long Mirror  And A Mirror On Desk/ Dressing Table As Had To Stand Up To See In The Large Walled Based Mirror. Heated Mirrors In Bathroom Would Have Meant We Could Have Used Those After Shower. Bigger Bathmat As Kept Getting Carpet Wet From Shower!,,,,,
,3031,We Stayed In A Lodge And All Agreed We Would Have Liked To Have Had A Clock In The Kitchen Area,,,,,
,3032,Lovely Room Beautiful Views Over The Valley,,,,,
,3041,Private Bar Should Be Filled A 5 Star Standard Room Service Menu Rather Strange And Limiting In Choice Bathroom Flooring Not Luxurious Door In Bovey Suite Slams,,,,,
,3047,Internat Access Was Particularly Easy Compared With Other Quality Hotels I Have Used.,,,,,
,3050,The Lack Of Mobile Phone Connection Might Be Considered A Major Plus  In Terms Of Being Able To Switch Off From Work  But  In Our View  Is A Disadvantage As  With Elderly Relatives At Home  It Was A Worry Not Being Able To Be In Contact With Them Easily,,,,,
,3051,The Bathroom Blinds Were Heavily Stained. Bath Water Drained Very Slowly.,,,,,
,3063,It Was First Class With The Upgrade,,,,,
,3065,We Love It!!!,,,,,
,3067,We Stayed In 2 Lodges G 2 & G 3. Whilst Very Comfortable Etc  They Are Now Rather Tired-Particularly The Outside Space  The Decks  Steps And Outside Furniture  Which Are In Desperate Need Of Some Tlc And Probably The Only Disappointing Thing.,,,,,
,3078,I Am Very U Nhappy To Learn That I Have Had 2 Bank Account Cards Stolen From My Room. I Do Not Beleive That I Am The Only One In The Party,,,,,
,3087,On Arrival At Hound Tor There Was No Heating In Any Of The Bedrooms Either Upstairs Or Downstairs - This Was Resolved That Night But The Next Night It Wasn't Working - Reported This To Reception But No Action Was Taken - Thankfully We All Like To Sleep In Cold Rooms And The Lodge Sitting Area Was Sumptiously Warm,,,,,
,3090,The Room Was Rather Dark And The Lighting Was Insufficient.,,,,,
,3102,Such A Pity To Find So Many Areas Of Badly Peeling Wall Paper In The Bathrooms  The Light Switch's In The Kitchen Are Difficult To Find Tucked Away Behind The Micro Wave  Veranada Door Would Not Lock And Veranda Furniture Was In Poor Condition Having Not Been Pressured Hosed From The Winter  The Cushions Were Left Out For Our Arrival And Were Wet! Wall Lights In The Sitting Room Would Benefit From A Dimmer,,,,,
,3105,We Stayed In A Lodge  But We Did Feel Some Attention To Detail Was Missing  The Veranda Could Do With A Very Good Sweep And Some Tlc  There Were Lots Of Stains On The 2 Chairs In The Lounge And Buttons Missing  The Metal Button Caps Were Quite Sharp?,,,,,
,3119,Bell On Door As You Cannot Hear Anyone Knocking,,,,,
,3120,Need A Bell As Cannot Hear Any One Knocking,,,,,
,3121,Not Worth The Money,,,,,
,3123,No View And Over The Kitchens And Noisy Early In The Morning,,,,,
,3707,We Were Disappointed On Arrival To See A Small Damp Patch In The Corner Of Our Bedroom. However The Overall Room Was Very Well Done And Comfortable.,,,,,
,3708,Very Large And Spacious,,,,,
,3709,The Unlimited Wifi Is Perfect So The Kids Can Watch Netflix Etc. On The Downside The Some Bits Of The Lodge Decor Are Looking Worn (Carpets  Some Furniture) And Contrast To The Excellent Fit Out Of The Bathrooms For Example. Needs A Bit Of Cap Ex I Think. Finally The Lodges Are Perfect For Us As A Family  Really Nice Format,,,,,
,3711,For The Price Per Night I Would Expect Small Fridge,,,,,
,3712,I Believe Wifi Should Be Complimentary With Rooms That Cost As Much As They Did.,,,,,
,3713,Sufficient But Lacked The Little Extra Expected From A 5-Star Establishment At This Price Level.,,,,,
,3714,The Windows Should Be Cleaned Because There Is Dirt Between The Window Glasses.,,,,,
,3716,When We Checked In I Asked If It Was A Quite Room (Room 11) And Appart From Being Right Next To A Loud Extractor Fan Was Told That It Would Be. When We Returned To The Room At 10Pm The Music From The Wedding Which Was Taking Place Was So Loud There Was Not An Chance That You Could Have Slept In The Room. I Do Not Understand In The Least Why The Managment Of Such A Hotel Would Ever Place A Paying Guest In A Room In This Position. Guests Of The Wedding Might Have Either Been Tipsy Enough To Sleep Or Kind Enough To Try But For A Couple Unrelated To The Wedding Festivities Its Just Not Acceptable In The Least. The Issue Was Quickly Resolved And We Were Move To A Less Noisey Room (Although We Could Still Hear The Music) But When Staying In What Is Meant To Be A Luxurary Hotel One Doesnt Really Want To Move At 10Pm. I Cannot Underline How Poor My Husband And I Thought It Was To Place Guests In Such A Room.,,,,,
,3720,Classic Room - In Need Of A Few Cosmetic Re-Touches  Lots Of Damp In The Bathroom  Peeling And Ripped Wallpaper  Various Stains On The Carpet,,,,,
,3721,The Internet Connection Was Very Poor. We Paid For 24 Hour Internet And Was Only Able To Connect To It Twice In That Time. We Tried Several Different Locations In The Hotel But Connectivity Was Very Poor.,,,,,
,3724,The Room Could Do With Some Restoring As There Were Big Chips Out Of Units  Doors Needed Painting. Stain On Ceiling Among Other Things.  Eye For Detail Needed To Bring Room Up To Standard. Stains On Bed Base.  The Standard Of The Room Was Not In Line With The Cost Of The Room But After Being Stressed Due To Tone Of Welcome And Only Being There Fore One Night I Did Not Want To Upset My Partner By Complaining Anymore,,,,,
,3726,Very Nice (And Well Insulated From Sound From Adjoining Bistro).,,,,,
,3728,My Partner And I Stayed For 3 Nights And Would Therefore Have Benefitted From A Bit More Storage Space In The Form Of A Chest Of Drawers So We Could Unpack And Hide Our Bags Away. The Room Itself Was Lovely  Quiet  Beautifully Clean And Just What We Were After. The Milk In Our Room Was Off When We First Arrived (I Think Due To The Fridge Being Turned Down Too Low Rather Than It Being Past Its Sell By Date) But When I Phoned Housekeeping It Was Replaced Within Minutes. The Regular Topping Up Of Tea  Coffee And Biscotti Supplies Was Also Appreciated As We Seemed To Go Through Them Quite Quickly!,,,,,
,3729,We Had The Room Above The Reception  Unforturnutly We Were Awoken On Several Occasions And From 6Am Onwards We Could Hear Only Talking And Doors Opening/Closing With Vehicles Arriving  Very Poor Nights Sleep. We Were Told The Manager Would Be Contact Us To Apologise But Have Not Heard Anything 2 Weeks Down The Line. Rest Of Hotel Experience Was Good  Shame We Didnt Sleep Well.,,,,,
,3730,The Toilet Seat Did Not Fit The Toilet Properly It Was Too Big For The Cistern And Would Not Stay Open. Each Time You Went To The Toilet The Lid Would Either Rest On Your Back Or You Would Have To Hold It Open.  The Coffee Filters In The Room Are A Great Idea But The Bins Are Wicker So Coffee Would Go Straight Through To The Carpet. For The Price Of The Room I Would Expect Someone To Have Checked Both Of These Before Having Guests Stay In The Rooms.,,,,,
,3731,Thought The Room (Kingtor) Needs A Nice Walkin Shower,,,,,
,3732,Wifi Should Be Free!,,,,,
,3740,The Only Problem Was The Lack Of Mobile Phone Reception In My Room.,,,,,
,3741,Our Room Was At The Top Of The Main Stairs And Therefore Very Noisy.,,,,,
,3742,The Radiator Was Not Working At First  Which Made The Room Quite Cold.  We Spoke To The Front Desk And They Fixed It.  In My Opinion Its Very Penny Pinching Of The Hotel To Charge For Wi-Fi.  You Can Use Wi-Fi For Free At Most Coffee Shops But Not At A 5* Hotel?!    ,,,,,
,3743,The Room Was Nicely Decorated But Let Down By A Large Patch Of Damp On The Ceiling,,,,,
,3752,Room Was Very Warm Even With Radiator Turn As Far Down As Possible. Shower In Bath Was Very Poor In Pressure -  Disappointed By This  Something This Simple In A Hotel Like This Should Not Be The Case,,,,,
,3753,Great Bathrooms And We All Liked The Elemis Products.,,,,,
,3758,Bath And Shower Appeared Fairly Basic Considering The Standard Of The Rest Of The Hotel,,,,,
,3760,The Whole Castle Was Very Warm  We Had The Radiator On In Our Room When We Arrived And It Made It Feel Very Stuffy. Sleeping Was Difficult When It Was So Warm.,,,,,
,3762,I Was In Room 63 And Couldn't Get Internet,,,,,
,3764,On The First Evening There Was No Heating (Room 29) As The Radiator Had Not Been Bled.  Although An Electric Fire Was Provided  The Staff Member Blamed The Lack Of Heat On Pipe-Work In The Spa! On Our Third Night  All The Lights Went Out And There Was A 20 Minute Wait For Someone To Find The Fuse Box To Remedy The Situation.,,,,,
,3769,There Did Not Appear To Be Any Information About The Spa Treatments In Our Room.,,,,,
,3770,Iron Leaked Everywhere. Noisy Lift Could Be Heard In Room And Vibrated Glasses Etc. Not Ideal But Not Major Issue,,,,,
,3775,We Have Rated The Feedback On The Initial Room That We Were Provided With.   This Room Was Extremelly Poor Considering The Limited Space  Lack Of View And Dirty Oversheets On The Bed.  In Overall A Very Claustrophobic Room That Did Not Portray The Luxurious Image Of Bovey Castle.  If We Were Not Relocated When We Requested We Would Of Immediately Packed Our Bags And Returned Home Without Staying The Night.  This Should Not Happen Considering The Room Rates.,,,,,
,3776,The Level Of General Repair Was Pretty Poor  Particularly In The Bathroom Where Skirting Boards Were Blown And Paint Was Peeling. The Decor Overall In Our Room (Castle Room) Was A Little Tired Looking And Ill-Coordinated. The Lack Of A Mini Bar Facility Was Also Surprising.,,,,,
,3777,Could Have Done With A Clock And Tissues In The Bedroom – There Were Quite A Few Marks On The Bedspread Which Weren't Very Satisfactory But Other Than That All Was Fine.,,,,,
,3778,There Was A Broken Hinge On The Window Meaning That We Couldn't Open The Window That Far In Case It Fell Off. That Basically Meant The Room Was Stifflingly Hot All Night Making It Hard To Sleep. There Was Also An Extractor Fan Outside The Other Window So It Was Too Loud To Keep That One Open To Get The Room Cool.,,,,,
,3782,We Had Issues With The Tv. It Wouldn't Turn On And It Was Hard To Operate. Had The Same Issue With The Tv At The Gym.,,,,,
,3784,Great Decorations - I Loved The Pressed Plants From 1844!,,,,,
,3785,The Bed Was Actually Too Soft - Not As Comfortable As It Could Have Been,,,,,
,3786,Perfect,,,,,
,3792,Amazing Views Over The Golf Course,,,,,
,3794,The Room Was Incredibly Hot Despite None Of The Radiators Being On And The Windows Being Open.  Although 0 Degs Outside It Did Not Make Up For The Heat That Was Coming From The Floor Below.  Also It Appears As Though The Kitchen Fan Is Extracted Through The Room Causing Vibrations And Noise Until Switched Off At 11Pm.  We Mentioned This To The Staff At The Desk In The Morning And Were Effectively Dismissed.  It Was Almost Impossible To Sleep.,,,,,
,3795,Fan Broken In Both Bathrooms Top Bedroom Door Very Difficult To Shut And Noisy To Close Tv Poor Reception,,,,,
,3804,A Little 'Tired' (Wallpaper Stains Etc).,,,,,
,3806,We Were Very Happy To Receive The Upgrade In Room On Arrival.,,,,,
,3807,Beautifully Decorated Without Being Fussy.  The Mattress And Linens Were Exquisitely Luxurious And I Had One Of The Best Night's Sleep In A Long Time.,,,,,
,3811,For How Much We Paid To Stay One Night  I Found The Room Extremely Basic. I Also Did Not Appreciate Having To Pay Extra To Connect To The Wifi For The Iphone / Laptops We Brought To Do Work Whilst We Stayed.,,,,,
,3814,Noticed Rattly Windows Upon Arrival But No Problem Overnight. Had To Search More Than I Would Expect To Find The (Most Important) Details About Breakfast. Maybe A Map To Show Where The Dining Rooms Are Too?,,,,,
,3820,Internet Access Could Be Better And Really Feel Should Be Free Of Charge Considering Rack Rate,,,,,
,3822,Complimentary Wifi Would Be Have Been Ideal.,,,,,
,3823,It Was Very Luxurious. We Were Very Grateful For The Upgrade We Received In Recognition Of Our Special Occasion - This Includes The Complimentary Champagne!,,,,,
,3826,It Was Painful To Have To Relog In To Wi-Fi Every Hour  Seems Unnecessary To Apply That Limit On Guests.,,,,,
,3827,I Do Feel That Spending £450 For One Nights Stay In The Hotel Customers Should Have Full Access To The Internet Not A Restricted Speed Of 1Mbps Or Have To Pay More Money For A Useable Speed... Who Charges For Internet Now Days Apart From Airports??,,,,,
,3828,No Free Wifi - For The Cost Of The Hotel  I Would Expect It As Standard,,,,,
,3830,The Bathroom In Room 40 Needs Upgrading. There Were Cracks In The Tile And The Basin Has Separate Taps For Hot And Cold Water- Not Something That You Would Expect From A 5 Star Hotel. Also The Bed Sheet Had A Stain On It ( Washed But Clearly Visible) Which Makes It Quite Unappealing,,,,,
,3831,The Decor Of The Bedroom And Bathroom Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,3838,We Were In Room 10 And You Cannot Use The Dressing Table As There Is Furniture In The Way. Meaning Nowhere In The Room To Do Hair And Make-Up.,,,,,
,3839,We Stayed In A Lodge And I Appreciate We Stayed During The Spider Season However The Lodges Are Meant To Be Cleaned Etc Before You Arrive And They Was On The Surface Clean However In Each Of The Curtains Downstairs There Was About 4-7 Massive Spiders In Each Bedroom (In Which We Called Housekeeping To Come And Get Rid Of Them) We Then Continued To Find About 10 More Over Two Days And There Was Cobwebs Everywhere Within The Curtains And Round The Poles And On The Ceilings So I Do Think The Cleaning Could Be Better As I Wouldnt Let My House Get Like That,,,,,
,3842,I Was A Little Surprised That Wifi Wasnt Complimentary Seeing As The Signal In That Area Is So Awful!,,,,,
,3845,The Rooms Ewere Run Down And The Internt Was Very Slow.,,,,,
,3850,Small Room  Poor Quality Bathroom  Not Impressed.,,,,,
,3852,None - I Like The Idea Of Free Water. Doesn't Happen At Every High End Hotel...,,,,,
,3854,We Were In Room 27. Absence Of Separate Shower Cabinet Was Odd For A Room Of This Cost  As Was The Flooring. Not Really In Keeping With The Style And Level Of The Rest Of The Room,,,,,
,3855,We Stayed In A Lodge  Which Was Fantastic  Well Furnished And Good Sized Rooms.  We Did Have To Move Lodges Due To A Heating Issue But That Got Resolved.  More Help Moving The Luggage Would Have Been Appreciated.  We Ended Up Having To Repack And Move All Our Bags Up The Road To Another Lodge.,,,,,
,3857,Rooms In The Main Lodge Were A Tad Hot,,,,,
,3858,The Furnishings Were Stained As Was The Carpet Which Is Not What I Expected From A Superior Hotel And  Indeed  A Top Suite,,,,,
,3860,The Bedroom Was Too Hot Due To Unusually Good British Weather However  Whilst We Left The Window Open To Try And Circulate Some Air  The 'Turndown' Service Team In The Evening Would Either Draw The Curtains Or Close The Windows  This Made It Increasingly Hot And Stuffy When Returning To The Room. A Complaint Shared With Other Guests.,,,,,
,3862,We Had Issues With Hot Water And The Shower Head Water Pressure,,,,,
,3863,My Father's Single Was Very Small  Which Is Fine But We Should Have Been Told.,,,,,
,3865,While The Room Was Nice  Upon Closer Inspection Some Of The Fixtures And Fittings Were Looking 'Tired'. The Wardrobe Was A Tad Tricky To Hang Clothes In As No Side Is Actually A Hanger Width.,,,,,
,3868,The Lodge Was Lovely But In Need Of Some Decorating/Updating.  (Nothing Major),,,,,
,3869,Outside Wooden Steps To Ingle Tor Very Slippy In The Rain  I Fell Down Them  Also Need Over Gloves To Be Provided,,,,,
,3874,Milk Was Off In The Fridge And No Bin To Put Rubbish From Drinks In.,,,,,
,3876,Some Of The Decor Needs Attantion...Looking A Bit Shabby,,,,,
,3877,Products In Bathroom Were Not Replaced Quickly Enough And When Certain Necessity Items Were Needed Such As A Razor  We Were Redirected To Local Co-Op.  Most 5 Star Hotels Offer These To Purchase.,,,,,
,3878,There Was A Distinct Lack Of Drawer Space For Clothes And We Were Only Staying For 2 Nights! There Was No Information In The Information Folder About Ironing Boards And Irons.,,,,,
,3880,I Thought The Junior State Room Looked Like A Fine But Very Average Superior Double,,,,,
,3881,The Tv And Remote Didn't Work Very Well  The Volume Couldn't Be Changed If Watching Something On Iplayer.,,,,,
,3882,Damp Patch On The Ceiling  Room Very Average At This Level,,,,,
,3883,The Room Was Booked Through Travel Zoo At A Discounted Rate And So We Got One Near The Boilers / Generators. Quite Noisy But Got Used To It,,,,,
,3888,I Was Disappointed With The Room Given That It Was Supposed To Be Castle Standard (Room 40),,,,,
,3892,I Appreciate (Having Owned A House Of Similar Age/Construction But Obviously Not Size) That Maintaining A Property Of This Size Can Be A Herculanean Task  However The Wooden Window Frames In Both Bedroom And Bathroom Desperately Require Attention Before The Windows Fall Out. The Wallpaper In The Bathroom Also Needs Replacing As It Is Badly Stained ,,,,,
,3895,I Thought For Such A Top End Hotel It Was A Cheek To Ask To Pay For Wifi...I Would Expect Either Foc Wi-Fi Or At Lease Free Wi-Fe In Reception.  Also In Our Room (30) It Had Rotten Wood In The Window Cill.  If The Windows Were Left Open And It Rained The Water Streamed In - Which Probably Explains The Rotting Cill.,,,,,
,3898,Wifi Was A Bit Hit And Miss Sadly! Mini Bar Would Also Be Good,,,,,
,3899,The Bedroom Internal Door Slammed  So Became Annoying If You Were In And Out Of Wardrobe Or Bathroom - Ended Up Proping It Open.,,,,,
,3901,Bathroom Wallpaper Had Some Spots On It Around The Lavatory Area Which Was A Little Off Putting And The Carpet Was A Little Stained - Although Attractive And Warm Underfoot Perhaps Not The Best Floor Covering For A Bathroom.,,,,,
,3903,The Charges For Using The Internet Were Confusing; Wifi Was Weak.,,,,,
,3904,Wifi Signal Was Very Weak,,,,,
,3906,It Was Very Very Strange That Each Room Had Only One Bathrobe (We Had 3 Rooms  So I Know This Was Standard  Not A Fluke In One Room). The Slippers Only Fit Women  Which Was Also Quite Strange. Also  The Heat Was Not Working In One Room And We Had To Ask More Than 4 Times To Get Some Help With Either Opening The Radiator Or Bringing In Space Heaters. Also  The Refrigerator Didn't Work In One Room - And Despite Moving The Milk And Drinks To Another Room And Reporting The Broken Fridge  Every Day  More Milk Was Put Into The Fridge Which Wasn't Even Turned On  A Total Waste. Why Was The Turn Down Service Including A Treat Of Fudge On Some Nights But Not On Other Nights? Seemed Inconsistent.,,,,,
,3907,We Were In A Lodge And It Was Fantastic,,,,,
,3909,Internet And The Iptv System Were Very Unreliable. Iptv Was Bad Last Year  But Seemed Worse This Year. Lots Of Picture Breakup All The Time  Two Mornings Out Of Three The Televisions Wouldn't Turn On  And Was Told By Reception (When The Phone Was Working) That All Tv Sets Were Out. Room Was Just Too Cold  No Control Over When Heating Could Be Turned On. Whilst I Appreciate That May Be Impreactical For Such A Size Of Building And Heating System  It Could Come On A Little Earlier In The Afternoon  And Would Make All The Difference.,,,,,
,3910,The Tv Signal Was Poor Which Made It Difficult/ Impossible To Watch  Wifi Should Be Free,,,,,
,3911,Bed Was Very Soft,,,,,
,3913,The Bed Was Too Soft And The Internet Connection Extremely Slow.,,,,,
,3915,Very Nice Room - Although Initially Some Snags - The Safe Did Not Work  The Heating Was Not Working On One Radiator  The Bathroom Was Cold With A Gap In The Window And The Toilet Kept Blocking - The Staff Dealt With These Issues Quickly And Professionally - Thank You,,,,,
,3916,Quite A Lot Of Damp Marks On Wall Would Be Only Criticism Of Decor,,,,,
,3917,We Stayed In Room 54 Which Should Have Been A Castle Room With An Unobstructed View - That Is If You Don't Count The Castle Wall 2 Feet From Your Window. Disappointing.  There Were Stains On The Carpet By The Window. Stains On The Arm Chair. Mould On The Wall By The Luggage Stand.  Was Also Annoying To Have Other Rooms Continually Slamming The Doors - Not Ideal For A Spa Hotel. Something Needs To Be Done With Those Doors!! On The Positive Side - I Think The Room Booked On The Friday Night Was More Superior Than The Room Booked For The Saturday Night But We Were Allowed To Stay In The Same Room.( From The Dealings I'd Had Re The Booking Of The Second Night I Genuinely Expected To Be Moved!),,,,,
,3918,My Husband Wasn't Particularly Happy With The View Of Drains Outside Your Bedroom Window.,,,,,
,3920,Tv Is A Little Complicated To Use,,,,,
,3923,The Bathroom Was Poorly Laid Out  The Room Was Grubby And Required Re-Decoration. We Were Above The Entrance And The Noise From The Events Company Taking The Wedding Staging Apart Was Going On Until 2Am. We Came Away For 24 Hours Peace And Quiet Whilst Parents Had The Children And Ended Up Getting Less Sleep Than We Would Have At Home With The Baby Keeping Us Awake.,,,,,
,3924,The Tv Didnt Work,,,,,
,3926,The First Room That I Had Had No Hot Water In The Shower.  More Surface Space Would Have Been Useful As It Was Difficult To Find Space To Eat Breakfast.,,,,,
,3927,Beds In The Rooms Were Very Comfortable Indeed  The Only Exception Was The Additional Airbed Which Was Suprisingly Hard.,,,,,
,3929,I Would Simply Add A Mirror On The Dressing Table,,,,,
,3930,Bathroom Was Very Small!  No Safe In Room  Internet Very Intermittent And Room Was Chilly Late Afternoon And When We Got Back From Dinner.,,,,,
,3931,Couldn't Lie In The Roll Top Bath As There Is No Way To Prevent Slipping Under Water. Needed Some Kind Of Bath Mat Or Similar,,,,,
,3932,The Lodge Required Milk And Bottled Water To Be Provided As Standard. It Was Also Was Cold On Arrival And Required Maintenance To Turn On The Heating In The Bathroom Upstairs.,,,,,
,3935,The En Suite Needs To Be Redecorated - There Was Peeling Paint And Stains On The Walls. The Room Was Extremely - I Live In Switzerland And May Partner Is Swedish - So We Know Cold -  And We Still Struggled With The Cold.,,,,,
,3936,Bathroom Looking Tired And In Need Of Redecoration,,,,,
,3937,Room Was Of High Standard But Windows Difficult To Open And Close And Bathroom One Leaked,,,,,
,3938,In Need Of Redecorating,,,,,
,3940,We Had Two Rooms And Our Keys Unlocked Both  Which Was Rather Strange And Would Make Me Question Security,,,,,
,3942,When We Returned From Breakfast Our Room Was Being Cleaned.  The Cleaners Did Not Vacate The Room.  In The End We Had To Ask Them To Come Back So That We Could Use The Bathroom. The Fridge Was Noisy,,,,,
,3945,Wifi Is Not Working Well In The Lodge,,,,,
,3949,It Wasn't Easy To Turn The Tv On  Maybe Some Instructions On Reverse Of Remote Control Would Help? Other Guests Had Same Problem.,,,,,
,3951,Tv Reception Was Intermittent  But I Was Not Staying With You To Watch Tv So It Did Not Matter,,,,,
,3953,New Curtains Are A Must,,,,,
,3955,Room Was Lovely But Wasnt Aware We Were Only Having A Double Bed As My Husband Is 6 Foot 3 And Would No Way Of Booked A Room With Only A Double In It  So Both Of Us Left Feeling Not As Refreshed As We Would Of Liked As We Had Travelled From Lincolnshire 4 Hours Drive,,,,,
,3956,When I Booked The Weekend Break I Wasn't Made Aware Of Us Having A Double Bed As I Wouldn't Have Booked It As My Husband Is 6 Foot 3 We Didnt Leave Feeling Refreshed As We Had Travelled 4 Hours Plus To Get To Bovey Castle,,,,,
,3957,We Stayed In Room 48  On Sunday Morning The Doors In The Corridors Had Noticeably Loud Closers And We Heard The Slam Of The Doors  From About 7.30Am Onwards - Please Get Quieter Door Closers!,,,,,
,3960,We Were In Room 22 Next To The Lift Which Was Very Noisy Until Midnight - The Lift Can Be Heard Quite Loudly From The Room - This Kept Us Awake As We Have Young Children And Again Early In The Morning From 06.30 Oddly The Morning Was Not An Issue As Our Children Rise Early But Could Be A Problem With Guests Wanting A Lie In,,,,,
,3964,Booked The Weekend As A Present For My Partner Birthday.  The Welcome Was Very Nice  But The Upgraded Room We Had Room 56 Looked Very Tired.  Their Was Stains On The Wall  The Bathroom Curtain Stained.  And The Main Window Was Broken  Pics Have Been Taken.  Not What We Would Call 5 Star At All.   Also Seemed Housekeeping Forgot To Refil Milk And Tolieteries.  Phoned For Milk Twice Before We Got Any  After A Nice Day Walking It Was Another Downer On The Special Weekend.,,,,,
,3965,We Were Upgraded By Reception Staff  But There Were Some Items In The Room That Required Attention And Therefore Felt That The 5* Rating Was Not Appropriate I.E. Bedroom Window Handle Was Missing.  There Were Several Wet Water Marks On The Walls And On The Bathroom Blind,,,,,
,3967,Hard To Get High Speed Internet. Worn Carpet In Corridor. Rooms Need Painting.,,,,,
,3968,Room 46 Had Towels On The Window Cill Because Of A Damp Problem  The Plaster Was Blown  The Paint Peeling. It Was In Need Of Repair  We Didn't Complain  But Would Expect It To Be Under Repair Before Another Guest Is Given The Room.,,,,,
,3973,The Room Was Lovely But The Bathroom Dissapionting Small Tired Grotty Flooring Not Of The Standard I Would Expect In A Hotel Of This Standard,,,,,
,3974,It Was Small And Overlokked The Carpark,,,,,
,3976,We Were Next Door To The Cleaners Cupboard And Were Awoken Very Early (Knocking And Banging).  Broken Tiles And Dirty Grout In Bathroom. Toilet Was On A Saniflow Pump Which Is Noisy And Unacceptable For This Standard Of Hotel. Housekeeping Called At 8.45Am To Clean Our Room Even Though We Were Leaving That Day???,,,,,
,3977,We Stayed In A Lodge And Compared To The Hotel The Exprience Was Not Good. The Walls Are Paper Thin So No Sound Proofing At All  The Floorboards Creaked Throughout  As Did The Doors. The Tiles In The Kitchen Were Unevenly Laid So Dangerous To Walk On. The Door Handles To Outside Doors Came Off In Our Hands Etc Etc. Whilst I Love The Hotel I Will Never Stay In A Lodge Again.,,,,,
,3979,All Was Great In Our Room. The Wallpaper/Lining In The Bathroom Above The Toilet Was Sagging. Suggest A Water Leek Through The Wall Air Vent On That Wall Has Had Some Water Ingress?,,,,,
,3980,Internet Not Easily Accessible On The Top Floor And Provisions In The Lodge Were Not As Good As Expected. Ie We Had To Ask For Milk & It Arrived 2 Hours Later  And There Were Insufficient Tea Bags For A 6-Person Lodge. Would Have Expected Perhaps Bread For Toast And Also Butter (Jams Were Available),,,,,
,3981,Whilst The Bedrooms Are Comfortable And Clean  They Are In Desperate Need Of Maintenance And Refurbishment.,,,,,
,3983,We Both Felt The Decoration Was Dated And Although The Size Of The Room Was Good  There Were Stains On The Carpet  Mould In The Bathroom And We Could See The Rawplugs Coming Out Of The Wall On The Shelf Above The Sink. We Didn't Think It Was Worth The Cost For An Overnight Stay.,,,,,
,3984,Although The Room Was Generally Fine There Were Cobwebs Around The Light Pendant  Stains On The Carpet (Although A Good Attempt Had Been Made To Hide It With The Bin Which Made It Difficult To Get Out Of The Door) And Mould Around Some Of The Bathroom Tiles.,,,,,
,3987,Not A Big Deal But The Hairdryer Was Of Very Poor Quality. I Didn't Bring One With Me Because I Assumed That There Would Be A Good One Provided  Considering The Price Of The Room. It Was Old  There Was No Streamline Attachment And It Was Only 1800W... All Modern Hairdryers Are 2000W. It Was A Bit Of A Pain  When I Asked Room Service To Bring Me Up A Better One They Just Swapped Our One With Another Room's Hairdryer Which Looked Of Equally Poor Quality. Just A Niggle And Certainly Didn't Spoil Our Experience.   One Little Thing  In The Bathroom (We Were In Room 47) There Weren't Any Hooks Apart From In Front Of The Only Full Length Mirror In The Room. This Meant That When You Washed Your Hands In The Sink There Wasn't Easy Access To A Towel And You Had To Move Anything You Had Hung On The Hooks In Order To Use The Mirror. A Few More Hooks Would Be Handy... Even In The Bedroom So We Could Have Hung Our Coats Up.,,,,,
,3989,I Loved The Wallpaper  Room 9  And Have Emailed Receptionto Ask For The Name Of It!,,,,,
,3990,The Lodge We Stayed In Met Our Expectations Size-Wise. However  It Was Looking 'Tired' (Outdated Kitchen  Bathroom Wallpaper Peeling/Scruffy).  Lodges Could Do With Reflecting And A Deep Clean.  We Found Two Very Large House Spiders Hiding In The Curtains And There Were Lots Of Dead Flies/Insects In The Window Ledge Of The Window Above The Main Sofa.,,,,,
,3991,Needed Repairs And Upgrade In Bathroom,,,,,
,3993,Temperature In The Lodge Was A Bit Hot!,,,,,
,3994,None.,,,,,
,3996,We Got A Deal From Travel Zoo  So I Was Not Expecting A Great Room. The Room Was Small And Poky. But Given The Discount We Got It Was Ok.,,,,,
,3997,We Changed The Room As Damp All Over The Bathroom Wall In First Room  So Paid For An Upgrade To A Stateroom. The Wallpaper Needs Changing In The First Room As You Wouldn't Expect It In A Premiere Inn Let Alone What You Are Offering. I Think Also The Wifi Should Be Free  You Don't Expect To Pay On Top Of A Premium Price,,,,,
,3998,There Was A Toilet Over Flow And Flood But It Was Taken Care Of Relatively Efficiently,,,,,
,4000,We Needed To Request A Second Bathrobe As There Was Only One  The Safe Was Not Working And We Requested Someone To Fix It  There Were No Gluten Free Biscuits On The Tea Tray.  It Would Be Nice To Have Two Comfortable Chairs In The Room To Watch Television Rather Than One And A Desk Chair.,,,,,
,4001,Beautiful View. But As Mentioned Previously  By The Time We Got To It  It Was Dark And We Couldn't See It Until The Morning.,,,,,
,4003,I Don't Like Rooms Where I Do Not Have A Mirror At A Dressing Table/Desk As It Means I Cannot Dry And Stlye My Hair. Because This Was The First Thing I Noticed  I Decided I Couldn't Risk Going For A Swim As It Was Bad Enough Trying To Straighten My Hair From The Other Side Of The Room Where The Plug Point Was. I Also Noticed That The Toilet Seat Was Loose On The Toilet And Wobbled About.,,,,,
,4005,No Milk Provided With The Tea & Coffee Facilities. Champagne Ordered On Booking Was Not Delivered,,,,,
,4007,My Wife Would Of Liked A Bath But The Water Came Out Brown.  There Was Also A Large Stain On The Ceiling Were There Had Been A Leak.,,,,,
,4009,The Douvet Was Too Thick And We Hardly Slept. We Turned Radiators Off Though. Perhaps Too Thick For The Good Weather We Are Ecperiencing.,,,,,
,4010,It Was Badly In Need Of Re-Decoration,,,,,
,4011,Very Luxurious Lodge  Everthing Required For A Comfortable Stay.,,,,,
,4012,Would Be Good To Have A King Sized Mattress Rather Than Two Singles Put Together,,,,,
,4014,Room Was Very Nice (Room 55)  Big Bathroom. My Only Complaint Was There Was A Lot Of Light Coming In To The Room Around The Door From The Light In The Corridor  Which Kept Us Awake At Night,,,,,
,4015,As You Know Problems With Wifi And Also Mattresses But You Were Very Helpful With The Latter.,,,,,
,4016,Poor Cleanliness In The Lodge Including Used Nappies  Tissues  Food  Clothing And A Toy All Left For Us To Clean,,,,,
,4017,Just One Little Thing We Didn't Have Any Spare Toilet Roll And Seemed To Run Out By The Morning,,,,,
,4018,Needed Better Blinds In Bedrooms Of Lodge (Small Windows No Drapes)  And Soundproof Of Boiler. Otherwise Fantastic,,,,,
,4019,Beautifully Furnished  Tasteful Yet Homely. Perfect.,,,,,
,4020,Very Noisy Appreciate It Was A 'Classic' Room As It Was A Last Minute Treat For My Husband But Constant Flow Of People Past Door Until Very Late Followed By Room Heating Banging From Early Moarning Meant A Very Poor Night Sleep.,,,,,
,4023,Most Comfortable Bed I Have Ever Slept In!,,,,,
,4025,Although I Did Find It The Kettle Was Not In The Most Obvious Place As It Was In The Cabinet Under The Tv  Whilst The Teas & Coffees Were In A Box On Top Of A Different Cabinet.,,,,,
,4031,Internet Wifi Dropped In And Out.,,,,,
,4033,My Room Was Very Small And Was Very Dark  It Had Little Natural Light Despite Being A Sunny Day And Overall Felt Very Gloomy.  I Saw Quite A Few Other Rooms Which Were All Lovely.  I Was Staying On Company Business  If I Was Paying Personally I Definitely Would Not Have Been Happy.,,,,,
,4036,I Was In Room 58.  I Really Struggled With The Lock On The Door (So Did The Porter Who Showed Me To The Room When I Arrived)  And On One Occassion Had To Get Help To Open It From One Of Your Staff.  Also Although The Milk In The Fridge Was Dated 24Th May  Upon Opening The Milk Was Sour - I Don't Think The Fridge Was Working So You Might Want To Check It.,,,,,
,4038,The Bathroom Was Very Cold So We Had To Dress Very Quickly After A Shower,,,,,
,4039,We Stayed In A Lodge And The Kitchen Did Not Match The Experience Elsewhere:  There Was No Potato Peeler  Some Of The Oven Trays Were Not Terribly Clean When We Arrived  And The Dishwasher Did Not Function Properly (The Detergent Tray Drawer Did Not Close.  Also  The Wine Glasses Were Far From Clean.,,,,,
,4040,Would Have Been Nice To Control Temperature In The Room.,,,,,
,4041,Decor Inside The Er Residence Was Lacking. Could Have Been More Plush.,,,,,
,4045,Internet Access Should Be Standard And Not Charged At This Day And Age.  It Is Essential And With Very Little Cellular Coverage This Was Our Only Issue With Our Stay.  Although It Was Nice To Be Completely Out Of Touch As Well.,,,,,
,4046,Very Disappointing Bathroom In The Room 8 However Very Happy With The One In Room 47,,,,,
,4048,Very Comfortable Bed!,,,,,
,4050,Kitchen Was Missing Oven Gloves,,,,,
,4051,Neither Televison In Sitting Room Or Bedroom Of Suite Worked Satisfactorily. The Picture On Both Sets Froze And Went Blocky Consistentky Making Them Unwatchable. We Had Young Children With Us  Who Like Certain Programmes On Cbeebies Channel. Half Way Through The Stay  This Channel Was Replaced By Radio 5 Live. None Of The Staff Could Resolve This.,,,,,
,4052,The Room Was Very Small And The Bed Was Tiny.  I Would Expect A Double Room To Have A Bed At Least 5' Wide But This Was Only 4'6' Which Made For A Very Uncomfortable Night.  Also The Pillows Were Really Hard - Therefore I Barely Slept A Wink,,,,,
,4053,Nice Bathroom  But Suite Felt Run Down,,,,,
,4054,Window Frame Needs Attention Tv's Need Hd Capability In A Hotel Of This Quality,,,,,
,4056,Bedroom Was Lovely. Struggled To Access The Paid Internet On My Ipad And The Receptionist Was Not Much Help In That.,,,,,
,4057,Free Internet Connection Slow And Limited. Would Have Been Lovely For The High Speed Internet Access To Be Free.,,,,,
,4058,Cheap  Loose Toilet Seat Not Brilliant!,,,,,
,4059,We Stayed In A Castle Room On Arrival We Found The Desk Light Did Not Work However It Was Not Enough Of A Problem To Warrant Complaining The Bathroom Was Very Cold With Only A Towel Warmer To Provide Heat Which Was At The Best Of Times Luke Warm The Cold Was Clearly Coming From Windows Which Were Very Draughty My Wife Was Very Much Looking Forward To A Bath But The Temperature Prevented Her From Doing So.Overall Not The Kind Of Accomadation You Would Expect From A Five Star Hotel.,,,,,
,4064,Twin Bed Pushed Together Very Disappointing,,,,,
,4065,Would Be Good To Have An Accessible Plug Near The Bedroom Mirror For Hairdryer (Room 37) The Wifi Was Very Unreliable And Slow,,,,,
,4067,Internet Wifi Was Pretty Weak....Fine For Emails But Bad For Internet,,,,,
,4068,The Internet Connection Was Extremely Poor. It Didnt Really Detract From The Overall Experience But Wouldve Been Nice.,,,,,
,4071,Very Small Annoyance - Room Door Closer Didn't Fully Close Door  So On A Couple Of Occasions I Found That The Door Wasn't Properly Closed After We'd Been In The Room For Some Time. Always Had To Wait Or Pull/Push Against Automatic Closer To Give It A Final Pull/Push To Close.,,,,,
,4074,Noisy As Next To Bistro And Above Swimming Pool Generator. Lovely Big Room.,,,,,
,4076,The Decor Is Getting Outdated. The Bed Sheets Had Some Holes  The Wall Paper Was Coming Off  The Door Had Holes And There Was Stain On The Wall Paper In The Bathroom,,,,,
,4080,The Bed Was Comfortable But A Little Soft  This Must Be The Hardest Thing To Get Right As Everyone Likes Different Firmness  And It Was My Preference And Not The Quality Of The Bed That Lowered The Score,,,,,
,4084,Wifi Very Expensive. With 2 Iphones  Ipad And 2 Laptops We Had To Pay 5 Times. ,,,,,
,4085,Was Quite Small  But I Guess As We Were A Voucher Customer That Was To Be Expected. We Showered In The Pool Changing Rooms Afterour Swim On Thursday Evening And I Used The Products Supplied Which Were Nice  Usually I Take My Own Products To Hotels As I Dont Like Hotel Stuff And Use Specific Brands But I Thought That Your Hotel Would Probably Have Quite Nice Stuff So I Tried It After The Swim And As I Said I Liked It So In The Morninng I Went To Use The Products For A Shower And When I Took The Top Off The Shampoo I Found A Hair (A Curly Grosse One!!) In It. I Took It Down To The Reception And The Lady Said Yuk And Asked If I Wanted Any More Which I Declined  We Then Told The Manager Who Did Appologise But By Then I Guess We Were A Bit Fed Up With The Experience. I Think I Will Probably Always Use My Own Stuff Wherever I Go In The Future.,,,,,
,4086,Lovely Room But No Electric Socket Near A Mirror To Dry My Hair. Locks Have Been Changed On The Door But It Seems No Effort Has Been Made To Make The Workmanship Good.,,,,,
,4087,Tv Did Not Work.  When It Did I Suspect You Were Putting Data Down The Same Pipe So Tv Was Constantly Freezing Making It Impossible To Watch,,,,,
,4088,The Room Overall  Especially The Bathroom Was Generously Large. Unfortunately  There Were A Few Details In The Room  Which We Think Could Be Improved - Especially For A Luxury Hotel. These Points Are: - Paint Coming Off From Window Frames - Cable Tangle Behind Tv/Minibar Is Clearly Visible - Should Be Hidden - Light In The Shower Was Coming Off - Stains In The Carpet Besides This  We Were Very Pleased With The Room And Its Design,,,,,
,4090,I Work For Mitchells And Butlers In There Pub Estate  And Find It Hard That You Have To Pay For Wifi In Your Room For 409 Per Night,,,,,
,4091,We Stayed In A Lodge  It Was Excellant,,,,,
,4092,There Was Nowhere To Hang Coats/Dressing Gowns Or Put Muddy Boots/Shoes. No Toothbrush Holder To Put Toothbrushes In. Every Hotel I Have Been To In My Life (And That Is Many) Has Had A Container For Toothbrushes. No Cotton Wool Or Cotton Earbuds.,,,,,
,4093,Very Nice.  We Had A Cot Delivered And That Was Good.  Size And Appointments Were Very Nice.,,,,,
,4095,With Two Very Young Children Aged 2 Yrs Old & 5 Months The Lodge Layout Was Not Ideal. Having To Go Up Two Flight Of Stairs To Enter The First Floor Front Door Is Difficult Carrying Child Seat Or Pushchair. Ended Up Using Bedroom Door To Wheel Push Chair In Which We Did Not Have A Key For. A Few Housekeeping Issues  No Oven Gloves  Mismatched Crockery / Glass Wear. Surprising For 5 Star. Bathroom Flooring Had Toothpaste Marks.,,,,,
,4096,If I Had To Make A Recommendation Then I'd Say That Fresh Milk Should Be Supplied Daily  Not Longlife.,,,,,
,4101,It Was Very Hot In Our Room  Even With The Window Wide Open.  There Needs To Be Air Conditioning  Or A Fan At The Least,,,,,
,4102,The Lodge Didn't Have Enough Wine/Champagne Glasses The Carpet Was Stained On The Floor One Room Not Terribly Clean,,,,,
,4103,Mobile Phone Signal Nil,,,,,
,4104,Doesn't Quite Apply As We Stayed In A Lodge. The Only Comment I Would Make Is That This Was Our Third Stay And It Was Noticeable That Some Of The Nice Touches That Made The Lodge So Special Had Gone  I Assume Because Of Costs? For Instance There Were No Robes In The Room Or Toiletries.,,,,,
,4108,The Bath Was Not Cleaned As It Should Be In A House With 5 Stars. The Curtains Were Full Of Toothpaste  The Toilette Did Not Work  We Had To Look At A Glasshouse Which Was Full With Rubbish ...,,,,,
,4109,We Were Given Room 10. Please See Below The Following Points: We Had A Twin Bed. The Divan And Mattress Were Completly Seperate. The Beds Were Held Together By A Flat Sheet. The Duvet On One Side Was Coming Apart The Top Cover/Throw Was Marked And Stained. In General The Bedding Looked Tatty And Tired.  Due To The Beds Not Being Fixed We Found That They Came Apart Thus We Were Sleepiong With A Gap In The Bed! In This Standard Of Hotel You Would Expect A King Size Mattress. Even More So As This Was Our Honeymoon!,,,,,
,4110,We Upgraded  To  A Junior Suite When We Arrived But Was Slighty Disappointed As There Was Paint Peeling On The Windowsill And Damaged Wallpaper In The Bathroom,,,,,
,4113,Our Room (17) Was Clearly Not One Of The Best Rooms In The Hotel - Very Average. The Shower Was Very Awkward To Use - With No Shelf For Soaps Etc. I Had To Bend Down (Which Is Not Easy When You're Heavily Pregnant) To Use Shampoos Etc. The Bathroom Was Very Badly Designed. The Bed Was Way Too Soft And Very Uncomfortable - The Worst Night's Sleep I've Had In Months. Our Internet Connection Was Very Slow.,,,,,
,4114,The Room Was A Little Tired. The Was A Leak Stain On The Ceiling. It Was Clean But There Was Also A Stain On The Carpet.,,,,,
,4115,I Feel That Offering A Basic And Enhanced Internet Service Isnt All To Helpful. At This Level A Good  Complimentary Service Really Is An Expectation..,,,,,
,4117,Room Was Tired And More Like A 3 Star Than A 5 Star Like Whatley Manor,,,,,
,4120,Lighting Was Very Low Even With Both Bedside Lamps On.,,,,,
,4121,On Returning To Our Room To Have Coffee I Had To Visit Reception To Have The Curdled Milk From Our Mini Fridge Replaced. There Was Also An Empty Hot Chocolate Sachet Amongst The Full Ones. Finally The Main Light In Our Room Did Not Work.,,,,,
,4124,Room Service: Ordered Soup. It Arrived Cold  But I Was Too Hungry To Wait For It To Be Put Right So Didn't Inform Staff.,,,,,
,4126,The Room Was Old Fashioned And The Bathroom A Disaster  Never A Five Star Standard. The Lamps In The Room Were Not Bright Enough. You Could Have Heard Your Neighbours Easily.,,,,,
,4128,The Room Was Extremely Hot,,,,,
,4129,Internet Access Too Cumbersome. As I Was Staying In A Suite  It Was Unclear How To Enter The Room Number As It Was A Name (Tor Cox),,,,,
,4130,Looked Tatty In The Bathroom,,,,,
,4133,The Bedroom And Bathroom Was Of Poor Quality. There Were Stains On All Cushions And Throws On The Bed & Stains All Over The Carpet. There Was Also A Large Amount Of Damp On The Walls. The Bathroom Was Not Particularly Clean And The Toilet Seat & Sink Were Both Broken & Should Be Replaced. The Bed Was The Saving Grace & Was Very Comfortable  And The View Was Lovely. A Real Shame As The Decoration Was Nice And Expected More Because Of The Price And Because All Of The Public Rooms Downstairs Were So Beautiful. The Carpet On The Stairs Leading Up To The Bedrooms Was Also Completely Threadbare Which Looked Poor For A 5* Hotel. Downstairs - Amazing  Upstairs - Poor.,,,,,
,4143,The Decoration Was Very Poor With Unaceptable Damp Patches In  Both The Bathroom And Bedroom. The Room Was Located Next To The Lift Which Was In Use Irregularly During The Night And Almost Constantly From 6.30Am On Sunday. The Noise Was Completely Unacceptable And I May As Well Have Had My Bed In The Lift Itself. For A Room Which Is Supposed To Be At The Higher End Of Those Available It Did Not Warrant The Spend.,,,,,
,4147,Room 12  Is Located In A Very Noisy Position With The Noise Of Some Type Of Generator Blasting Throughout The Night Whilst Trying To Sleep. I Do Not Think That Is Very Enjoyable For Anyone Staying In This Room.,,,,,
,4149,The Blanket On Thge End Of The Bed Had Someones Hair On It And Was Quite Dirty. The Evening Housekeping Removed It. The Valance Also Needs Washing.,,,,,
,4150,The Main Light Was Not Very Strong In Room 47 And The Room Door Lock Needs Replacing.,,,,,
,4151,Room 38: Small Leak In The Roof In Hallway When It Rained And Stained Carpet. Bathroom Good.,,,,,
,4152,Stunning And Very Comfortable,,,,,
,4153,Very Nice - We Stayed At Cottage With Our 2.5 Year Old,,,,,
,4155,I Went Into The Bathroom Searching For Slippers To Pop On.  I Have To Say When I Took Them Out Of The Plastic Wrapping There Was A Nasty Smell ... It Was The Slippers!!  Sorry To Mention This But They Smelt Fishy  Literally.  We Stayed In Room 11 If You Want To Check It Our Further ,,,,,
,4157,As A Travelzoo Customer I Wondered If We Were Given A Less Desirable Room  Being On The Ground Floor Next To The Stairs To The Leisure Centre  Opposite The Toilets  Next To The Bistro And Overlooking The Outside Seating Area.  The Actual Room Was Lovely But The Location  Not So.,,,,,
,4159,It Was Such A Perfect Room That When I Awoke To Draw Back The Curtains I Was Greeted With This Jaw Dropping Hazy Autumn View That Sets Bovey Castle Above All Other Competition,,,,,
,4162,Tv Was A Bit Intermittent But It Didn't Spoil Our Stay.  Our Room Was Above Reception Which We Were Really Pleased About Because We Were Worried That Our Baby Might Be Noisy For Other Residents!,,,,,
,4164,Lighting Poor.,,,,,
,4166,Amazing,,,,,
,4167,Tired,,,,,
,4172,I Do Not Like Having To Pay For Internet As An Extra Cost. It Should Be Included In The Room Price (My Personal Opinion) Housekeeping Twice Forgot To Check Our In-Room Fridge / Tea Stock.,,,,,
,4175,Not The Same Level As The Hotel Itselve.,,,,,
,4177,There Wasnt Really Much Design In The Decoration Of The Room. There Were Damp Patches And The Bathroom Was Very Poor. You Charged For Limited Internet Access Which Given The Price Of The Rooms Is Not Really On. Nowadays Internet Access Is Almost A Given And Should Not Be Charged. Not Happy Wiht The Room At All - Noisy  Cold  Small.,,,,,
,4189,The Wifi Worked Fine On The Kids' Ipad 1 And On My Iphone But Would Not Work In A Million Years On My Ipad 2. I Think There Must Be A Problem With The Wifi On The Newer Ipad 2.,,,,,
,4194,The Entrance To The Lodge Was Very Slippery And Green With Algae.  My Children And Some Of The Adults Fell On Their Way In And Despite Numerous Requests This Was Not Resolved.,,,,,
,4196,Shabby Around The Window,,,,,
,4198,Considering The Price Of A Room And The Overall Cost Of The Stay I Was Pretty Disappointed That One Had To Then Pay On Top For Internet Access. I Have Stayed In Far Cheaper Hotels Where It Is Free!,,,,,
,4199,I Think Bearing In Mind The Cost Of The Rooms And The Very Poor Mobile Signal In The Area You Should Provide Complimentary Wi Fi Access.,,,,,
,4201,Very Warm For Sleeping. Could Do With Better Lighting In Bathroom And Possibly An Iron/Board.,,,,,
,4203,Es Fehlen Leider In Den Zimmern Kommoden Bzw. Stauraum Um Die Kleider Zu Verräumen.,,,,,
,4209,Given The Large Size Of The Bathroom A Much Bigger Bath Would Have Been More In Keeping.,,,,,
,4210,Excellent Room Clean And Tidy Really Comfortable,,,,,
,4211,Fantastic Lodge,,,,,
,4212,Poor Plumbing In The Ldge,,,,,
,4213,The Bedroom Door Was Very Poorly Decorated With New Timber Untreated. Poor!,,,,,
,4215,Carpets Were Stained.  Lack Of Crockery.  No Toaster - Asked For One And Was Given One Which Only Had 2 Out Of 4 Slots Working.  Only 2 Wine Glasses  So Had To Use Champagne Glasses For The Rest Of The Party.,,,,,
,4216,As Before,,,,,
,4218,We Stayed At Rose Cottage. It Was Not As Clean As Our First Visit But Suits Our Purposes.,,,,,
,4222,Free Wifi Would Be Appropriate In A Hotel Of This Category.,,,,,
,4225,No,,,,,
,4227,It Was Described As Having A Private Area For Children's Beds.  It Was Not So.,,,,,
,4228,The Rug In Our Room (33) Looked Tired And Was Curled At The Edges - It Let The Room Down. We Liked The Elemis Toiletries Provided And The Robes Were Great - Very Warm And Comfy. A Good Selection Of Drinks And It Was Lovely To Have The Water Bottles Replaced Regularly. We Used Iplayer On The Tv Several Times But Found That The Poor Signal Made The Coverage Jerky. Good Quality Bedding And A Very Comfy Bed. We Would Have Both Liked A Softer Pillow - Maybe A Pillow Menu Would Be A Good Idea. Good Shower Pressure.,,,,,
,4230,It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Slighly Comfier Chair But Appreciate That Space Was Limited. The Bed Was Really Comfortable And One Of The Pillows Was Feather Which Was Good.,,,,,
,4232,We Stayed In A Lodge And It More Than Met Our Expectations.,,,,,
,4233,The Original Room We Had Was Tiny And Run Down.  We Moved To Room 60  Which Was Lovely But Extortionate For What It Was.,,,,,
,4236,The Room Looked Tired  Paint Peeling Away From Around The Windows  A Few Stains Here And There. The Room Gave The Feeling That It Needs Redecorating. We Stayed In Room 22.,,,,,
,4238,Maybe A Little Too Warm At Night Despite Have Have Windows Open.,,,,,
,4239,Very Comfortable Bed,,,,,
,4241,The Room Was Effectively The Disabled Room  Which Is Fair Enough  But The Absence Of A Bath Was Disappointing. The Open Plan Lay Out Also Meant That The Room Was Either Roasting Hot  Or Freezing Cold  With Nothing In Between.,,,,,
,4243,The Charges For The Internet Were A Little Confusing And We Had A Different Story From A Phone Conversation Before We Arrived To That On Reception,,,,,
,4244,The Matress On The Sofa Bed Is Not Of A Good Enough Quality For Any One Over The Age Of 5 - I Tried It And Couldnt Have Slept On It And Our 10 Year Old Who Never Complains Found It Very Uncomfortable,,,,,
,4246,We Stayed In A 3 Bedroom Lodge And It Was Perfect For Our Family Of 6. I Only Wish That The Washer/Dryer Was More Efficient.  We Had Traveled From The States To France And Then England And Our Clothes Really Needed A Wash!!,,,,,
,4250,Noise Was A Bit Of An Issue  We Were In A Magnificent Room That We Loved But Could Hear Doors Closing And People Walking Down The Stairs.,,,,,
,4255,It Was Fingle Tor Lodge,,,,,
,4256,As Room 38 Is Located Under The Eaves  It Gets Very Warm In Hot Weather; A Portable Cooling Unit Should Be Provided On These Occasions.  There Is A Fire Escape Route Signed Within The Room Down A Spiral Stair But Access To This Was Locked With No Obvious Location For The Key In Sight. This Is Potential A Breach Of Fire Regulations. The Water Was A Yellow-Green Colour And Therefore Unlikely To Be Fully Up To Potable Standards; This Should Be Rectified Or A Suitable Warning Displayed.,,,,,
,4257,Room Was Uncomfortably Hot And Caused My Husband Distress,,,,,
,4258,Was Generally Good But Points That Let It Down: Plug Sockets Did Not Allow Hair Dryer To Be Used In Front Of Mirror Or To Have Kettle Other Than On The Floor. Armchairs Too Small - There Was Space For Larger More Comfortable Chairs. Bathroom Only Had One Small Soap And Had Space For A Separate Shower. Also The 'Uninterrupted' View Was Only Visible Standing Up Which Was Very Disappointing.,,,,,
,4262,The Internet Access Was Intermittent  The View Was Restricted  There Is Water Damage Evident In The Bathroom  The Doors Were Squeaky And Banged Closed  The Television Was Set To Spanish  The Shower Head Was Fixed To The Wall.,,,,,
,4264,The Room Was Cold As The Heating Doesn't Come On Until 6Pm Even In March! The Bathroom Was Severely Disappointing. Nowhere Near A 5 Star Rating. The Ceiling Has Flaking Paint  The Grout Is Breaking Up  The Wallpaper Is Tired  The Towel Rail Didn't Heat Up. Our Friend's Room Had Mildew In The Bathroom.,,,,,
,4266,I Have Stayed At Bovey Several Times And Bought Over Night Stays For Gifts  For Others. I Was Very Disappointed With The Room  The Decor Was Not Of The Standard I Have Experienced Before And Would Recommend A Refurb To This Room- There Were Water Stains On The Walls In The Bathroom And The Whole Room Lacked Ambience. I Recently Became A Resort Member And Used One Of My Complimentary Nights Accommodation To Treat A Friend And Myself To A Bit Of A   Break  The Room Was Disappointing And Will Be Ensuring I'm Not In That Room In Future!,,,,,
,4267,Why Are You Charging For Wifi - Many 5 Star Hotels We Have Stayed In All Over The World Do Not Charge,,,,,
,4268,You Have To Solve The Wifi Issues,,,,,
,4269,A Little Small But I Know It Was Your Cheapest Option.  I Checked At Reception On Arrival That There Would Be Twin Beds And Was Told That They Would Be Separated At Turn Down. They Weren't--On Either Night And The Bed Was A Bit Small For 2 People Not Wishing To Be Intimate!.,,,,,
,4270,Bedroom Was Average For The Costs,,,,,
,4271,Shower Door Handle Fell Off. Hook Coming Out Of Wall.. Needs Some Love!,,,,,
,4272,We Stayed In The Lodge And Were Disappointed With The Bbq And Its Equipment,,,,,
,4273,We Had Booked A Valley View Room And Were Upgraded To A Junior Suite Which Was Great,,,,,
,4274,The Room Was Very Hot.,,,,,
,4276,Lovely Except For Horrible Cheap Polyester Bathrobe ...What Has Happened To The Lovely Fluffy Cotton Ones,,,,,
,4277,We Have Stayed In The Same Lodge  Jaystone  The Same Week For Three Years Now.  During That Time It Would Appear That No Maintenance Has Been Carried Out.  We Found Considerable Dust Throughout The Lodge  Stains To The Carpets  Peeling Wallpaper In The Bathroom  Peeling Paint On The Outside Seating Areas  Insufficient Seating Outside And A Wobbly Table.  I Made The Manager Aware Of My Concerns As To The Condition Of The Lodge Last Year And Indicated Again This Year That All Was Not Well.  This Holiday Works Extremely Well For Us As A Family And The Lodges Idea Is Generally Good So It Seems A Shame To Allow Them To Deteriorate Through Lack Of Basic Maintenance.,,,,,
,4280,When We Were Shown To Our Castle Room We Soon Realised We Were Above The Kitchen Fan I Asked Reception Staff For The Operating Times And Were Told The Fan Was Turned On At 8Am The Actual Time Was 6Am If I Had Known This I Would Have Seriously Considered The Upgrade Option!,,,,,
,4281,Felt The Rooms Didn't Reflect The Rest Of The Hotel And Location. Particularly The Artwork.,,,,,
,4282,A Polyester Dressing Gown ? I Appreciate Towelling Ones May Get Stolen But A Polyester One Is Horrible! Really Horrible! We Had One Feather Pillow And Two Foam. My Fault I Did Not Change Immediately But They Shodul All Be Feather   With Foam On Request. Paying For Internet Service In This Day And Age?  And £5 A Day? Really Not Worth Agitating Customers  Surely You Should Include In The Price?  Simply A Hassle To Get A Code Enter It Etc Etc.,,,,,
,4283,For An Upgrade It Was Not Great  But Was Certainly Sufficient.,,,,,
,4285,Lift Not Working  So Had To Go Upstairs Where Carpet Was Very Worn  Not Expected In A Five Star Hotel  Room Needed A Bit Of Work  Terrible T Bags! We Needed To Ask For More Brought Up In A Handful Not Very Professional  We Are In Catering And Know What Is 5 Star  Also A Mini Bar Would Be Nice,,,,,
,4286,Couldn't Work Out How To Access The Internet,,,,,
,4287,Whilst Everything Was Lovely  We Were Disappointed With The Bathroom  There Appeared To Be Mold Or The Residue Of Mold Around The Bath. When We First Arrived The Room Was Quite Cold. I Did Call Room Service Who Offered Me A Portable Heater  As The Heating Was Not On Until 6Pm? I Felt For The Level Of Accommodation The Room Should Be Warm Already. We Had No Milk In The Fridge And The Fridge Was Very Noisy So I Had To Unplug It. I Did Tell Your Staff About These Items. That Said We Still Had A Lovely Time.,,,,,
,4289,Mold On Walls  Bath Had Scum Marks Around It And The Toilet Brush Was Filthy...Not What I Would Expect At Even The Most Reasonably Priced Hotel.,,,,,
,4290,Stated That Lodges Would Be Serviced Twice A Day Actually Once A Day  Bare Minimum Done Each Day,,,,,
,4291,Bathroom A Little Cheap,,,,,
,4292,The Bedroom We Were Allocated Was Shabby And Not Up To The Quality We Were Asked To Pay For. The Decoration In The Bathroom Was Particularly Shabby With Paint Pealing Off The Bath Panel  Water Stains Down The Side Of The Wall Near The Shower Screen And Signs Of Recent Decoration On Other Walls Which Had Not Been Finished Off. At Best The Room Allocated And Its Condition Was Equivalent To A 2 Or 3 Star Facility And Not The Higher Quality Room We Were Supposed To Get.,,,,,
,4294,Internet Connection Was Very Poor In The Hotel  Lodge Was Good.,,,,,
,4296,As Mentioned On Leaving  I Find The Hotel's Policy Of Charging (Significant Rates) For Internet Access Thoroughly Unacceptable.  Free Internet Access Is A Given In This Day And Age.  At The Room Rates You Charge There Can Be No Excuse For Not Providing Free Interenet Access.  Even Costa Coffee Do When I Pay £1.90 For A Cup Of Coffee.  The Charging  For Me And I Suspect Many Others Who Have High Reliance On The Internet (Eg Keeping In Touch With My Office)  Has A Disproportionate Effect On My Impression Of The Hotel.  Bluntly It Feels Like A Wholly Unjustified Way To Extract A Few Extra Pounds Out Of Guests.  I'd Seriously Suggest You Reconsider Your Policy. It Was The Only Aspect Of The Hotel I Took Real Exception To And  From Your Part  Is A Wholly Unnecessary Negative Impact On Guests.   If The Interenet Charge Is So Critical (Difficult To Believe) Add An Extra £5 To Your Room Charges.    As A Second Minor Point I Was Surprised The Bbc Radio 4 Wasn't Available On Your Pre Set Radio Chanels.   ,,,,,
,4297,The Windows! They Need Attention I Was Unable To Keep The Window Open When The Room Was Stuffy!,,,,,
,4301,The Milk In The Fridge (Even Though Fresh) Seemed To Split When Added To Tea And Coffee. A Stocked Mini Bar Is Also Preferable  As Sometimes You Want To Time To Decompress And Not Actually Have To Interact With Anybody  However  Professional And Welcoming.,,,,,
,4302,Unbelievable That You Have To Pay For The Internet,,,,,
,4304,The Most Expensive Room I Have Ever Booked And Amongst The Worse Quality.,,,,,
,4305,It Was Far Too Warm.,,,,,
,4306,Extreme Condensation Problem In The Bathroom.,,,,,
,4307,Sadly We Had A List Of Complaints When We Arrived. There Was Mus All Over A Bedroom Floor And Pasta And Dirst Over The Kitchen Worktops - This Was Dealt With. There We Not Enough Dinner Plates - More Were Bought But Were Too Big For The Dishwasher. The Tv Controller Needed A New Battery - Not Fixed So Had To Change Manually Or Stand Right In Front Of It. We Asked For A Dog Towel Which They Promised To Bring Donw - These Never Arrived.,,,,,
,4308,There Were A Few 'Tired' Patches On The Furniture.,,,,,
,4309,The Tv Didn't Work!!!,,,,,
,4310,Lovely And Warm Everything Was Satisfactory.,,,,,
,4311,The Bedrooms Are Now Starting To Look Slightly Tired & Dated. Not All Rooms Have A Seperate Shower Which Is Always Disappointing. The Rear View Rooms Can Be Quite Noisy With Air Conditioning Units Outside Of The Bedroom Window & Passing Traffic Below. We Have Stayed In Many Five Star Hotels This Year  And I Am Sorry To Say That Your Bedrooms Are Not Quite To The Same Standard. For Top Money  Guest Do Expect The Best.,,,,,
,4312,I Was Expecting It To Be More Luxurious,,,,,
,4313,Could Have Done With More Shower/Bath Gel And Soap.,,,,,
,4314,Internet And Mobile Access Very Poor.,,,,,
,4316,Our Toilet Seat Needed Fixing.  We Could Have Mentioned This To The Reception  Who Were Very Approachable  But We Did Not.  These Things Happen And We Were Not Angry But It Did Need Attention.  Also There Is No Facility For A Mirror To Use A Hairdryer.  However  I Went To Reception About This And They Immediately Provided Me With An Extension Lead.,,,,,
,4318,I Was Very Disappointed With The Size Of Our Room And Bathroom Considering We Paid Four Hundred Pounds A Night.  The Carpet In Our Room Was Covered In Stains Which I Would Not Expect To See At A Hotel Of This Quality.  We Were Moved On The Second Day To A Much Nicer Room.  I Still Do Not Think It Was Worth The Money.,,,,,
,4322,We Were A Little Disappointed With The View From The Room Ie The Car Park As This Was Supposedly A Junior Suite Upgrade With The Valley Rooms Being Cheaper But Guaranteeing Valley Views.,,,,,
,4323,The Fan Outside My Window Was Deafening.  The Gm Told Me It Was The Kitchen Fan. The Hotel Would Either Move Us Or Turn The Fan Off Overnight.  The Room We Were Offered Was Inappropriate For A Second Single Guest Bed - Too Small. We Were Forced To Stay In The Original Room  With Promises The Noise Would Be Shut Off Overnight. At 2;30 In The Morning  I Came Down To Ask Again To Have The Fan Turned Off. The Men At The Front Desk (Two Of Them) Told Me It Was Not The Kitchen Fan  But The Boiler Or Water Pump And Could Never Be Turned Off. Does The Gm Not Know What Operations Are In 'His' Hotel???  And Not One Word From The Gm Nor Staff That Morning.,,,,,
,4328,Could Have Done With A Bit Of Airing Before Hand.,,,,,
,4331,When We Arrived  There Was A Strong Moldy Smell In The Downstairs Area.,,,,,
,4334,The Room Looked A Bit Tired  With A Tain On The Headboard,,,,,
,4338,We Were Upgraded To Junior Suite Which Was Nice And The Standard Of Cleanliness Was Very Good. Coffee Was A Bit Awkward To Make  Hot Chocolate Was Delicious.,,,,,
,4341,Very Tired Looking And Badly In Need Of Decoration And Probably One Of The Worst Bathrooms We Have Encountered In A 'Luxury' Hotel.,,,,,
,4344,The Bathroom Would Have Benefitted From An Extractor Fan.,,,,,
,4346,We Stayed At Rose Cottage Which Was Very Comfortable And Provided Everything We Needed.  The Addition Of A Wireless Router This Year For Free Broadband Was A Bonus.  We Were Surprised To Find That The Main Hotel Charges Guests For Internet Access And Heard Quite A Lot Of Guests Complaining About This.,,,,,
,4350,Dirt Behind The Tv And Bedside Master Suite Tables  The Kitchen Was Scruffy And Badly Needs Redecorating. Carpets Dirty Looking And Cheap. Bed Not Very Comfortable And Polyester Duvet!! Patio Very Dirty And Table Covered In Moss. Varnish Peeling Off The Patio Decking So Not Pleasant To Sit Outside.,,,,,
,4351,It Was A Hot Weekend And The Rooms Were Stuffy And Hot But On The Plus Side When I Mentioned This To Your Cleaning Manager She Went To Her Room And Gave Us Her Fan From Her Office.,,,,,
,4353,We Had Upgraded To A Superior Castle Room  And Had To Phone Down And Ask To Be Moved If At All Possible From Room 8 As The Bathroom Was Tiny And Really Below Standards.  We Were Moved To Room 44 Which Was Much Better In Every Way.  The Pillows Are Too Hard And Firm.  Should Have More Squishy Ones And Maybe Choice Of Feathers Etc.,,,,,
,4356,Room Pleasant With Spectacular Views. However  With Such Poor Mobile Phone Service I Believe That A 5 Star Hotel Would Make Arrangements For Guests To Be More Catered For Than 2 Pc's On A Balcony Above A Lounge Area. However  We Did Find That Mobiles Could Connect In The Library Following A Guest Recommendation,,,,,
,4357,It Was Comfortable But With No Outlook.,,,,,
,4358,Door To Bathroom Was Low And Low Beams At Edges Of Room.,,,,,
,4359,Toilet Seat Did Not Fit The Toilet  Shower Flow Was Weak  No Plug Sockets Near A Mirror For Drying Hair.,,,,,
,4361,Bathroom Disappointing. Small Size Meant Not Enough Shelf Space For Two & Only One Basin. No Hooks Anywhere To Hang Bath Robes And Not Enough Space In Wardrobe Once Clothes In It.  Christmas Tree And Decorations A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,4362,Bathrobes Dirty N Bedspread Needed A Clean,,,,,
,4364,Very Comfortable Bed,,,,,
,4366,Felt That Some Attention To Decor Was Needed  Especially In The Bathroom.,,,,,
,4371,Not My Colour  Preference   Few Cob Webs  In The Main Sitting Room    Found The Sky Frustrating As The Tv Had Limited Channels And  Not Obvious How To View Sky Tv,,,,,
,4372,The Extraction Units Out Side With Today's Fans It Should Not Be That Loud .. Why Has That Not Been Looked At...,,,,,
,4375,Charging For Wi-Fi Is Out Dated And Completely Out Of Line With The Cost Of Accomodation,,,,,
,4376,We Were Placed In A Back Bedroom Overlooking Roof Tops  When Asked If We Could Move Rooms We Were Told That We Were Not Staying Long Enough To Entitle Us To Another Room  However If We Extended By One More Night Then They Would Certainly Move Us To Another Room!!!!  The Room Had Limited Access To The Internet That Was Incredibly Slow.,,,,,
,4377,As I Would Describe The Hotel As A 5 Star Which Is Well Deserved   I Think Full Wi-Fi Free Of Charge Would Be Better  This Is As There Is Little Service On Mobile Networks Due To Location So It Would Be Beneficial And The Guests Don't Have To Worry To Connect   Not Much Of A Loss To Hotel If Free!!!!,,,,,
,4379,Very Comfortable Bed,,,,,
,4381,Mould On The Bathroom Ceiling And Blind. Milk Off  Bed Hard,,,,,
,4382,The Flooring In The Bathroom And Carpet In The Bedroom Was Marked And The Wood Work Needed Some Attention.,,,,,
,4385,The Floorboard Need Repairing So That The Lodge Does Not Creak Every Time Someone Takes A Step. Those Staying On The Ground Floor Could Hear Every Step Taken On Either Of The Two Floors Above. The Sound Insulation Of The Bathrooms And Pipes Is Non-Exhistant. The Gas Smell From The Hot Water Heater Is Repugnant And Should Be Remedied Immediately By Replacing It To Electric Or Natural Gas And Putting The Venting Away From Directly Under And Beside The Kitchen And Bedroom Windows. The Bathrooms Had Mold And Damp  And The Shower Doors Were Not Properly Sealed. Fixtures Were Broken And Or Missing From The Bathrooms. A Lot Of Your Outdoor Lighting Is Too Bright And Not 'Hooded' Such That At Night It Is Too Bright And That Takes Awat From The Beauty And Incredible Natural Resource Of Being On The Moore. The Blinds In More Than One Room Were Broken. All Of These Issue Are Easily Remedied With Proper Care And Management.,,,,,
,4387,The Lodges Are Quite Nice,,,,,
,4389,There Was No Fridge For Milk And Therefore No Milk For Tea,,,,,
,4390,I Was Dissapointed Not To Have A Fridge In A Hotel Of That Standard And The Carpet In The Bathroom Was Marked In Several Places Which Although I Am Sure It Was Clean Di Look Rather Un Hygenic.,,,,,
,4396,The Lamp Shade In The Corner Wasfalling Apart And The Toilet Seat Was The Wrong Size For The Toilet  Hence Youcould Not Sit On It!,,,,,
,4398,Totally Fine,,,,,
,4403,Slight Confusion Over Internet Access Was Resolved Expertly By Reception - Thanks.,,,,,
,4404,The Beds Are Too Small For 2 Adults To Sleep In And Even An Older Child And Parent Will Have Problems. Elemis Products Are Expensive But Not Good Quality In My Opinion.,,,,,
,4405,Bed Lovely But So Soft  Had To Spend A Couple Of Nights In Second Bedroom!,,,,,
,4406,Very Comfortable,,,,,
,4407,Very Hot Water From Both Hot And Cold Taps For Around 10Mins-Strange Plumbing!,,,,,
,4408,We Had To Call For The Cleaners As Our Top Bedroom Was Full Of Dead Flies And Around The Lodge,,,,,
,4409,Attention To The Shower Cubicle Ref Mould/Mildew In The Corners Of Sealant.,,,,,
,4411,The House' Fringle Bridge' Needs Some Attention To Cobwebs And Corner Dirt Build Up.  **The Washer Ruined T Pieces Of My Husbands Clothes With Grease Stains.**,,,,,
,4414,With All Of The Walking And Exercise  Just Make Sure The Water In The Room Refrigerator Is Kept Stocked. It Is A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,4415,The Room Decor Is A Little Tired. In The Shower There Is No Shelf/Stowage For Shampoo Bottles Or Soap. Having The Towel Rail Over At The Basin So The Bath Towels Are Nowhere Near Shower.   Although We Could Access The Internet In The Room It Is Very Slow.,,,,,
,4416,Being Next To The Lift Shaft Was Rather Noisy At Times,,,,,
,4419,We Upgraded As This Offered A Better View But There Was Mold On The Walls And We Had To Ask For The Bathrobes. It Took Two Attempts To Get Our Luggage.,,,,,
,4420,Didn't Like The Black Damp Stains On The Walls And This Was An Upgraded Room!,,,,,
,4422,Windows Could Have Better Opening /Closing Mechanism,,,,,
,4423,I Stayed In Room 41 Which Was Very Clean And Comfortable. However  The Door Lock Mechanism Looked Like It Was Bodged Up (Wrong Size Fitting) And The Toilet Seat Couldn't Be Raised To The Upright Position As The Flush Handle Was In The Way. Again  Wrong Sized Sittings Had Been Used.,,,,,
,4424,Bathroom Did Not Have Enough Shelf Space No Cup For Toothbrushes,,,,,
,4425,The Bed Was Extremely Uncomfortable  Sloping In The Middle Not At All Comfortable.,,,,,
,4428,Shower And Bath Water Was Warm But Not Hot.,,,,,
,4430,Vaule For Money Was Questionable  Very Nice Room But A Little Pricey,,,,,
,4434,The Bathroom Was Disappointing - Dated  In Need Of Redecoration And A Small Bath With Shower Over.,,,,,
,4436,I Strongly Advise You To Provide Real Feather Duvets And Pillows For The Beds. The Synthetic Fibre Filling You Have Is Really Not Up To Standard,,,,,
,4437,Found The Tv And Remote Hard To Work Out How To Use,,,,,
,4438,The Internet System Seems To Have Degraded Somewhat Form The Past Visits.. The Log On Screen Was Annoying And Had To Be Re-Set Every Day.. We Were Staying For  4 Days.. The Login Screen Should Be Able To Set To This.. Also We Have 7  Multiple Log On Items 1  Laptop  3 Ipads And 3 Smart Phones .. Better Internet  Service Needed,,,,,
,4440,Very Clean And Wonderfully Comfortable. The Mattress And Pillows And Crisp  Clean Linen A Real Joy.,,,,,
,4441,Obviously Didn't Have One Of The Better Rooms Probably Because We Were On A 'Travel Zoo' Deal  The View Out Of The Window Was Two Thirds Filled With A Pitched Roof Right Outside.,,,,,
,4442,Beds Were So Comfortable,,,,,
,4445,Sound Proofing Not Good Especially In Room 8.,,,,,
,4447,Internet Access Is Very Expensive And Should Be Provided Free  Given The Room Price,,,,,
,4448,Wasn't Serviced Until Past 1300 In The Afternoon On Saturday 28Th - Not Soon Enough.,,,,,
,4449,Therre Were Signs Of Mould In The Shower,,,,,
,4450,Needs Cosmetic Maintenance.  Some Lamps Were Quite 'Wobbly'  Water Stains On Wall And Ceiling  Door Lock Had To Be Replaced (Which Was Done Promptly!)  Back Porch Deck Stain/Paint Peeling.  One Important Need Is To Have A Light Blanket In Each Bedroom In Addition To The Duvet (Which Was Very Hot Even With Windows Open At Night).,,,,,
,4454,Excellent,,,,,
,4457,The Price For The Room Did Not Match To The Quality Level. On The Carpet And On The Blanket Were Stains. Furthermore The Breakfast Was Not Realy Good. As A Hotel With A High Quality Level The Breakfast Should Be On A Much Higher Level Too.,,,,,
,4458,Loved The Carton Of Milk In The Fridge,,,,,
,4461,Disappointed About The Continuous Background Noise From The Swimming Pool Condensers Which Disturbed Our Sleep. We Did Complain But Nothing Could Be Done And We Were Disappointed That Nobody Came Back To Us Even Though We Made Our Views Clear On 2 Occasions. Such A Shame In So Peaceful A Location To Have Such Background Noise Interference.,,,,,
,4465,It Was Looking A Bit Tired With Some Nasty Stains On The Bathroon Flooring,,,,,
,4467,Very Cold. Had To Ask For Extra Heaters (Which Were Provided Quickly And Were Very Efficient),,,,,
,4469,Your Internet System Is Bizarre! Why One Should Pay Another Fee For Every 2 Devices Is Beyond Me. It Was Free Last Year And The New System Was Not An Improvement And Didn't Seem Any Faster. Fortunately You Agreed To Only Charge Me For One Connection Fee For 4 Infrequently Used Devices - Again Your Reception Staff Were Exemplary In Sorting This Out,,,,,
,4472,Booked A Junior State Room And Was Given A Room In The Attic Not At All Stately At £440 Per Night Was Complete Rip Off Complained After One Night And Room Changed To A More Suitable Room Thanks To Frederico For That,,,,,
,4474,The Television In The Sitting Room Was Old And Seemed To Have A Mind Of Its Own - As Did The Remote Control. It Was Also Frustrating That It Was Not Set Up So That It Was Immediately Obvious Which Channel Was Stored Where. My Wife Could Not Get The Television In The Bedroom To Work At All.,,,,,
,4475,Lodge Needs Deep Cleaning Of Carpets And Sofa.  Smelled Stale.  Soil Marks Throughout.  Dusty Light Fittings.,,,,,
,4477,Bathroom Is Poor Standard .......Damp Stains Around Windows ......Bed Was Two Singles But With Double Fitted Headboard .................Uncomfortable,,,,,
,4480,We Were Given An Upgrade On Arrival  So Were Very Pleased With Our Room  Thank You.,,,,,
,4481,Lovely And Quiet In The Mews....Bed Very Comfortable,,,,,
,4482,On The Friday Night The Room Was Very Overlooked And People On The Slope By The Ferrets Looked Straight Into The Windows .. Including The Bathroom Which Meant Having The Blind In The Bathroom Down All The Time .  We Were Pleased To Be Moved From That Room On The Saturday Afternoon After Being Disturbed By The Setting Up Of The Band For The Party To Be Held In The Block Below Us .. The Noise Was Appalling  Vibrating Through The Room .. I Am Grateful You Were Able To Move Us  .. However... On The Saturday Night Although The Room You Moved Us To Was Lovely Our Night Was Ruined By The Noise From The People Attending The Party .. It Is I Think Unacceptable At A 5 Star Establishment To Be Disturbed For Nearly An Hour At 4 Am,,,,,
,4483,The Room Was Far To Warm. We Could Not Adjust The Temperature And This Lead To An Uncomfortable Night,,,,,
,4484,The Room Was Not At All Like We Had Seen On The Internet  Very Basic For The Price We Were Charged And The Room Was Very Dusty. The Bathroom Had Seen Better Days.,,,,,
,4488,There Was An Unpleasant Stain On The Headboard In Room 2.,,,,,
,4491,Unfortunately Our Tv Volume Was Not Working  It Was Reported To Reception And A Porter Came To Attempt To Fix  This Was Unsuccessful. No Replacement Was Offered.,,,,,
,4492,Our Bedroom Was Perfect  Extremely Clean And All We Hoped For. The Staff Were Excellent.,,,,,
,4495,I Used Both My Iphone And My Ipad To Access The Internet Via The 24 Hour Paid Option. It Seemed To Suggest That Two Devices Were Included But In Fact I Was Charged Twice.,,,,,
,4500,As Per My Previous Comment Not Really Good Enough For A 5 Star But Comfortable,,,,,
,4501,When Paying Several Hundreds Of Pounds For A Room I Don't Feel I Should Have To Pay A Few Pounds In Order To Be Able To Access The Internet. I Expect Anybody That Uses That Type Of Room Needs To Be In Touch And Making A Few Extra Quid On Internet Access Leaves A Bad Feeling.,,,,,
,4503,To Charge So Much For Wifi Access Is Ridiculous In This Day And Age - And Even More So When There Is No Mobile Phone Reception At All In The Hotel.  The Cost To The Hotel Of Providing Wifi Is Negligible And Charging The Rate You Do Is Just Profiteering.,,,,,
,4504,I Had Alot Of Trouble Getting On To The Internet.  I Called Down At 9.15Pm To See If Something Could Be Done  I Received A Call Back To Say They Were Waiting On A Call From The Internet Company But Then Didn't Hear Anything Further.  At 11.00Pm I Gave Up!,,,,,
,4506,I Felt That The Room Tired Looking   The Plug In The Basin Had To Be Taken Out By Hand.,,,,,
,4508,We Always Think That The Bathroom Is The Area Where Attention To Detail Is Overlooked E.G. The Shower Control Was Lose On The Wall; Toilet Flush Handle Wobbly; Paint And Wallpaper Were Tired; Water Stains. We Have Stayed Many Times And In Many Different Rooms At Carlyon Bay Hotel And The Bathrooms Are Always Imaculate.,,,,,
,4509,Internet Should Be Free Of Charge,,,,,
,4510,The Worst Bed Ever.  No Free Wifi Is Penny Pinching,,,,,
,4511,Was Upgraded Free Of Charge Because Of Incident That Happend In The Restraunt,,,,,
,4517,Probably Should Have Booked A State Room. More Info At Homepage Would Be Helpful,,,,,
,4518,I Requested A Double Bed And Got Two Singles Pushed Together  I Would Have Expected Much Better From A 5 Star Hotel. The Room Lacked Luxury !!,,,,,
,4520,The Decor Was Tired And The Wireless Internet Connection Poor. Connection Was Spasmodic At Best And It Wasn't Possible To Work. Not Worth The High Price You Charged For The Room.,,,,,
,4521,The Toliet Seat Was Broken At Time Of Arrival And We Had To Report This 2 Days Later For It To Be Changed,,,,,
,4522,No Mob Connectivity In The Room Or Wifi,,,,,
,4524, We Had A Junior Suite (Rm 22)    The State Of The Room Was Appalling; It Was Filthy And Tired. Cushions And Tub Chairs Were Badly Stained And Grubby  So Much So That I Had To Put A Towel Over Them To Sit Down. The Woodwork And Furniture Was Worn (Water Marks And Stains On Occasional Tripod Table  Writing Desk Badly Chipped  Wardrobe Badly Dented With A Couple Of Chunks Out Of It  Even The Ceiling Light Shade Was Dishevelled)  The Carpet Was Stained  The Radiator Had Dark Drip Stains  There Were Water Stains On The Ceiling  The Wallpaper Was Marked And Torn In Places.  The Bathroom Was Really Dated  In A State Of Disrepair And With Really Filthy Blinds  Cracked Bath Panel And Limescale Encrusted Towel Rail.    We Remained At The Hotel Because We Were Attending A Wedding In The Vicinity And Were A 4½ Hour Drive From Home.   Although The Manager  Federico Arranged For Us To Be Shown Other Rooms  We Decided That On Balance It Made Sense To Remain In A Grubby Room With An Amazing View Than Move To A Grubby Room With A Lesser View.     ,,,,,
,4527,Already Mentioned In My Letter Of Complaint  Which You Have Chosen To Ignore.,,,,,
,4528,Originally In #62  Room Was Like An Oven  Noise From A/C Condensers Opposite Was Noticeable And There Was A Damp And Moldy Patch Of Wallpaper Next To The Bed Head.  Went And Told Reception And Was Instantly Moved To #36 Without Any Quibble Or Fuss.,,,,,
,4529,Looking A Bit Tired Around The Edges,,,,,
,4530,Personally I Would Have Liked A Rode Hook In The Bathroom,,,,,
,4531,Milk In Fridge Was Off (Large Lumps And Very Bad Smell) But New Bottle Delivered Very Quickly When I Called Reception.  Tv Remote Only Partly Worked.  Toilet Handle Had Some Sort Of Problem Which  When Flushed  Made The Lid Pop Up And Slap Back Down Again.  Water Pressure Was Low And As A Result  Shower Attachment Was Either Cold Or Too Hot.  Wardrobe Held Shut And Was Opened By Two Bolts Fitted To Outside Of The Doors (Not What I Would Have Expected).  Nowhere Logical To Plug In Kettle (Had To Be On Floor) And Nowhere Near A Mirror To Plug In Hairdryer.  Hairdryer Atachment Didn't Fit The Hairdryer. Light In Main Room Too Dim (No Brighter Lighting Option).  Air Brick In Wall Very Noisy (But It Was A Very Windy Night!),,,,,
,4532,Tv Would Not Turn Off By Remote,,,,,
,4533,I Missed The Tea  Fruit In Cream That I Had Received Daily In My Room During My Previous Visit In 2010.,,,,,
,4537,Was A  Descry The Wallpaper Was Rip The Fan In The Bathroom Did Not Work The Toilet Dint Flush Without Popping The Cistern Lid Off The Shower Dint Run Consistent Need I Go On !!!!,,,,,
,4539,Very Poor Quality Room  Really Lets The Rest Of The Experience Down.  On This Basis Alone We Would Neither Recommend The Hotel To Friends Or Stay Again.  One Of The Childrens Fold Down Bed Matrices Was Almost Impossible To Lie On  The Sofa Leg In The Room Was Dangerously Put Together And We Had To Call For Maintenance  The Fridge Was Not Working And Frankly The Bathroom Was Shoddy And This Was The Smallest  Family Room We Have Stayed In.  So  Hugely Disappointing.  Certainly Not Worth The Drive From London.  A Shame As The People You Employ Are Excellent.,,,,,
,4540,Our Hot Water Didn't Work For Two Days - So It Did Cause Some Distress.  The Manager Allowed Us To Shower In A Unit Nearby Which Helped Quite A Bit And Eventually The Heater Was Repaired.. So All Was Well That Ended Well.  It Seems Spare Parts For The Hot Water Heater Might Be Handy To Have Around!,,,,,
,4543,The Internet Connection Was Very Slow Which Made Working Quite Difficult.  I Had Also Not Realised That There Was No Network Coverage Which Meant I Had To Use Hotel Phone Which Was Expensive.  I Think The Lack Of Coverage Should Mentioned On The Website  Especially For People Who Plan To Work While Staying At The Resort.,,,,,
,4545,Beds 2/3 A Little Noisy,,,,,
,4548,Tv Was Very Poor Picture Quality,,,,,
,4549,Next To Lift So Some Noise,,,,,
,4550,The Internet Connection In Room 19 Was Very Poor And There Was No Phone Reception. We Needed To Go Down To The Library To Receive Calls And Use Our Tablet.,,,,,
,4552,The Noise Of The Man Snoring In The Other Room Made It So We Couldn't Sleep For 2 Nights.,,,,,
,4553,Reassurance That The Water Is If Drinking Quality Due To Its Yellow Colour (Room 8),,,,,
,4561,In Our Arrangement Was A Warm Breakfast  But We Had To Ask Twice To Get Something For The Second Morning And It Came Over One Hour To Late! In No Other Hotel We Had To Pay For Wifi! The Television Was Not Working  It Was In A Installation Modus. For 9) We Liked To  But It Wasn't Possible Through The Audi Event.,,,,,
,4562,Yes I Had No Hot Water And I Was On The Ground Floor And Every One Could See In My Room From Terrace And Very Noisey From The Generator Outside My Window So Over All I Had A Poor Stay Food Was Awful  Ruined My Birthday,,,,,
,4564,Decor And Lighting In The Bathroom Were Not Great. Shower Was Poor.,,,,,
,4566,Room Size And Bed Comfort Were Fine  But A Toilet That Wouldn't Flush And The High Room Temperature Were Not. Also  With A Bathroom Of That Size  It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Surface On Which To Place Toiletries--Small Table Or Shelf. The Lack Would Have Been Even More Noticeable Had I Been Traveling With My Husband  I.E.  Two Guests In The Room And Not Just Me.,,,,,
,4567,It Was Somewhat Hot As We Only Had One Little Windonw That Opened And We Were Facing The Hot Afternoon Sun. I Would Recommend Having More Windows That Open And Fans In The Room.,,,,,
,4568,I Was Upgraded To A Superior Castle Room And It Made All The Difference,,,,,
,4570,The Bathroom Facilities Felt In Need Of Updating,,,,,
,4573,There Was No Fridge Or Safe In The Room. The Clock In Th Bathroom Had Not Been Reset To Gmt Giving The Impression That The Room Was Not Used That Often. The It Cable Trunking Was Shoddy And Detracted Quite A Bit From The Overall Impression Of The Room. The Blinds When Rolled Down We Not Particularly Clean,,,,,
,4579,Charging For Wifi Seems A Bit Beneath A Hotel Of This Standard.,,,,,
,4583,We Stayed In A Lodge And It Would Have Been Nice To Have Some Toiletries On Arrival.,,,,,
,4584,Room Lovely As Always But Again We Expect The Highest Of Standards Here - You Are Supposed To Be At The Top Of Your Game So: - No Biscuits Refreshed On The 2Nd Day And No Fudge Delivered On The 2Nd Night,,,,,
,4590,I Was In Room 14 And Found Everything Fine. I Never Could Figure Out How To Stop The Tele And Lights So I Just Unplugged Them.,,,,,
,4591,A Bit On The Small Side....,,,,,
,4592,Room Layout Was Poor. Could Not See Tv Easily From Chairs  That Were Not Comfortable. Electric Sockets Not Easily Accessed For Phone Chargers And Hair Drier. Hair Drier Lead Too Short  Had To Sit On Floor To Use Machine. Clothes Wardrobe Was A Joke. Hanging Rail Too High. Bathroom Lacked A Bidet And Second Sink. Not Five Star Facilities.,,,,,
,4594,The Lodge (Jaystone) Was A Place That I Literally Could Just Move Into And Live.  As We Were Staying With Another Couple It Was Ideal That Bedrooms Were On Different Floors.  The Only Negative - And A Very Small One - Is That The Sofas/Seating In The Sitting Room Are Not Very Comfortable To Relax On.,,,,,
,4595,Beautifully Decorated  Very Clean And A Wonderful View.,,,,,
,4602,The First Room We Were Shown Was Dirty  Was Right Next To Kitchen Extrzctor Fan And Was Shabby,,,,,
,4605,Yes. Room 3  I Think.  It Was Very Noisy - The Cause Was The Swimming Pool Pump  I Think.  The Wardrobe Wasn't Deep Enough To Hang A Dress Or Any Other Item Longer Than A Blouse Or Jacket  Without It Creasing.  There Was No Fridge (For Fresh Milk To Be Kept  For Example) And It Wasn't Very Nice To Have To Keep The Kettle On The Floor To Plug Into The Electric Socket  Or To Use Packets Of Uht Milk(!) - Ok For A Youth Hostel But Not At All In Keeping For Such A Lovely Hotel As Yours.  In The Morning  The Handle Of The Shower Control Came Off In My Hand And Once Reception Had Contacted The Maintenance Person  I Was Told It Would Screw Back On  Which I Did To The Best Of My Ability  But It Fell Off Again Later.,,,,,
,4607,Beautiful View From The Bedroom. Everything Was Excellent,,,,,
,4608,The Toilet Blocked Twice  Although This Was Speedily Attended To. We Had To Ask For More Soap -Only One Provided For Two Basins And The Bath.,,,,,
,4609,Good To Have 2 Chairs,,,,,
,4610,The Bathroom Was A Bit Draughty And Cold,,,,,
,4611,All Answers To Question 7 Above Refer To Lodge G2,,,,,
,4613,Lack Of Natural Light In The Bathroom Was The Only Difficulty/Downside.,,,,,
,4614,Stained Carpet  Room Basic For Price Paid,,,,,
,4615,The First Room That We Stayed In (No15) Was Overly Warm And The Noise From The Extractor From The Kitchen  Which Ran All Night  Was Intrusive.  Our Second Stay In Room 19 Was Very Much Better.,,,,,
,4616,We Felt That The Bathroom Was Tired And Need Of Renovation,,,,,
,4617,The Hotel Has Been Refurbished Very Nicely But The Lodge Interiors Are Naff,,,,,
,4619,Originally We Were Given A Bedroom With A Huge Noisy Extractor Fan Outside. Completely Unacceptable For A 5*Hotel,,,,,
,4620,Lovely Room  - Valley View Beautiful,,,,,
,4622,We Stayed In A Lodge And The Kitchen Was Very Inadequately Provided With Pans. There Were 3 Saucepans And Only 2 Lids That Fitted These And The Smallest That Had No Lid Was Too Small To Be Useful. This Meant That Cooking Our Evening Meal Was Fraught And Dangerous.,,,,,
,4624,Lovely Room  Nothing At All To Fault With It.,,,,,
,4627,Overlooking The Car Park Meant That It Was Quite Noisy And We Did Not Open The Windows - If We Had Paid The Normal Amount For The Room I Would Have Complained. The En- Suite Was Extemely Narrow - It Was Not Easy Yo Get To The Loo!,,,,,
,4630,It Is Such A Shame That Some Hotels Think That People Staying In A Single Room Are Second Class Citizens. It Was The Most Poorly Laid Out Room I Have Ever Stayed In. Stained Carpet  Woodwork On Door All Damaged. No Easy Access To Plugs For Hairdryer. Not Enough Surfaces To Put Things In Bathroom. Nowhere To Eat As I Wanted To Use Room Service. Had To Eat On The Bed. Absolutely Not Worth £189 Per Night This Is Outrageous Price For Such A Shabby Ill Equipped Room.,,,,,
,4634,A Coat Of Paint In Some Areas Is Needed.,,,,,
,4636,Think Wifi Could Be Included In The Cost Of The Room. Would Have Liked A Choice Of Pillow As I Prefer A Flatter Pillow So My Sleep Was Not As Good As It Could Have Been,,,,,
,4637,The Bathroom Was Quite Poor - Mediocre Shower/Bath.  We Had To Ask For Robes.,,,,,
,4641,As Mother Of The Groom I Was Expecting An Upgraded Room  If That Is What I Received  Then My Son In The Adjoining Room Was Also Upgraded As Our Rooms Were Very Similar  Except His Was Larger! I Have To Say I Was Disappointed With My Room  Which Took The Edge Off My Experiance.,,,,,
,4642,View Over Car Park Was Unappealing,,,,,
,4643,The Power Point For The Kettle Was In A Ridiculously Inaccessible Place Behind The Tv.  There Is No Place To Put A Flannel/Soap/Shampoo Bottles In The Shower.  Slightly Tatty Paint Finishes On Ceiling And Doors - Not Good For A 5 Star Hotel.,,,,,
,4644,I Mentioned On Our Second Day That The Bathroom Door Hinges In Our Room (No 16) Squeaked Very Loudly To The Point That Somebody Going Into The Bathroom At Night Would Wake The Other Person Sleeping.  I Asked If Somebody Could Put Some Wd40 On The Hinges While We Were Out  But Nobody Did Anything While We Were There.,,,,,
,4647,Dark Room  Table Lamp In Room Tatty Milk In Fridge Was Off,,,,,
,4648,Wi If Was A Bit Intermittent,,,,,
,4649,There Were A Few Cobwebs In The High Up Eve Spaces  I Would Suggest Purchasing Special Pole Cleaners To Reach Them,,,,,
,4651,The State Of The Carpets In The Hallways And Stairs Upstairs Leave A Lot To Be Desired And On The First Floor Are Quite Wrinkled And People Could Trip.,,,,,
,4652,No,,,,,
,4655,It Was Warm  Comfortable  Roomy And Had A Lovely View.,,,,,
,4656,The Single Beds Are Really To Narrow And To Soft,,,,,
,4658,Very Nice Room And Happy To Have Paid The £40,,,,,
,4659,Very Comfortable And Spotlessly Clean,,,,,
,4660,Lovely Room/Bathroom  But Used Earplugs First Part Of Night As Very Loud Noise Behind Corner Partition  ? Sounded Like Central Heating Boiler. Very Noisy From Afternoon Until Around Midnight.,,,,,
,4661,The Standard Of Housekeeping Was Poor  Milk In The Fridge Was Old.,,,,,
,4664,Bedroom (Room 15) Was Great But My Only Observation Is That The Carpet Needed Cleaning And The Bathroom Door Would Not Shut,,,,,
,4666,I Had A View Of A Roof (Room 5) - I Would Never Pay £207 Myself For Such A Room,,,,,
,4667,The First Room We Were Shown To Was Absolutely Awful. I Can Accept  Being On A Travelzoo 'Offer' That We Were Not Going To Be Offered 'A Room With A Spectacular View'  But To Be Given A Room With A Window That Looked Directly Out Onto A Chimney Stack Of Some Kind  Was Appalling. Hotels Really Ought To Follow The Example Of Cruise Ships  Where Customers Are Advised (In Advance) That Their Room May Have An Obstructed View. Some Hotels Offering Travelzoo Deals Are Clearly 'Ripping Off' Customers. Fair Enough  After Expressing Our Dissatisfaction  We Were Given A Better Room - But This Had Been Available All Along - So Why 'Try It On' With The Customer? Anyway  This New Room Seemed Ok (Tatty - In Need Of Some Attention) And Then After A Bath I Stood On A Drawing Pin!!!? What Was That Doing There? When I Reported It To Reception - They Were Not That Bothered?,,,,,
,4672,Too Many 'Fancy' Tea Bags And Not Enough Traditional Ones. The Make Used For English Breakfast Tea Was A Bit On The Weak Side - Try Twinings Or Similar. Duvet Was Too Heavy For A Warm Night (Room Was Very Warm).,,,,,
,4674,Staining On The Wallpaper Near The Radiator Bleed Cap Room 23  Looked Unpleasant And More In Keeping With A Road Lodge Not A Room For That Price,,,,,
,4675,See Previous Comment On First Offer  Upgrade Was Fantastic,,,,,
,4676,It Was Let Down By The Bathroom Which Does Not Match The Standard Of Rest Of The Hotel.  No Hand Rails  Worn Areas Around The Bath  Badly Fitting Toilet Seat  Stained Blind.   One Of The Robes In The Wardrobe Was Dirty Or Maybe It Was Just An Old Stain - I Certainly Didn't Want To Wear It!,,,,,
,4677,The Handle On Our Shower Broke And We Reported It.  The Closet Light Bulb Was Out.,,,,,
,4679,This Was Our Second Visit To Bovey Castle Occupying Two Of Your External Lodges. My Understanding Was That Everyone Thought The Accommodation Was Excellent.,,,,,
,4683,We Couldn't Find The Hairdrier Which Reception Then Told Us Over The Telephone Should Be In The Basket In Our Wardrobe. It Wasn't (!) But A Very Helpful Chambermaid Brought Us One Immediately. We Didn't Purloin The Original Hairdrier!!!!,,,,,
,4685,It Was Very Small Compared With Other Rooms We Saw People In Our Party Had. No Tea/Coffe Making Facilities.,,,,,
,4687,Dissapointing To See Stains/Water Marks On The Bed Valance Had A Problem With Wifi  Very Well Sorted By Front Of House Staff,,,,,
,4689,The Room Was Far Too Hot Especially In The Dressing/Bathroom Area.  The Radiators Were Cold So Presumably Was Controlled By The Hotel.  We Slept With The Windows Open Even Though It Was -3 Deg Outside!,,,,,
,4690,Television Was Not Working And Took 24 Hours To Repair,,,,,
,4691,The Biscuits Were Stale,,,,,
,4692,Pillows Could Be Softer,,,,,
,4695,Only Problem Was The Weather!  It Was A Heatwave And The Windows Were Very Small And So We Couldn't Get Enough Air In To The Room To Cool To A Comfortable Temperature.  However As Soon As I Requested A Fan It Was Provided  Just Not Powerful Enough To Be Very Effective.  It Was Just One Of The Rare Occasions That Air-Conditioning Was Essential.,,,,,
,4697,We Had Been Upgraded As Party Leaders To Your Stateroom - And I Have Never Stayed In Such Fine Surroundings  Even Though I Regard Myself As Reasonably Well Travelled. However  Every One Of The Other 26 Members Of My Party Told Me How Impressed They Had Been With Every Aspect Of Their Stay  Particularly The Rooms.,,,,,
,4698,No Phone Service,,,,,
,4700,Small Point But The Plug Did Not Work In The Basin And Despite Reporting Twice It Was Not Repaired.  Also Water Marks On The Ceiling Above The Bed And Door And One Window Would Not Open.,,,,,
,4702,The Drain In The Bathroom Sink Didn't Work Properly.,,,,,
,4704,We Had A Beautiful View Over The Countryside But Unfortunately All The Double Glazed Windows Were 'Blown' I.E. They No Longer Had An Airtight Seal And The Gap Between The Two Panes Had Filled With Condensation So That The View Was Ruined . I Was Pretty Shocked At The Poor Quality Of The Double Glazing Which Really Lets Down The Hotel.,,,,,
,4705,Tv Remote Seemed Very Slow To Work!  Didn't Like The Coffee  But Nice To Have The Facility,,,,,
,4707,Didn't Work To Have Breakfast In Room As You Did Not Provide A Table For This. To Sit I Armchairs With A Small Table Was Not A Good Experience,,,,,
,4708,A Trouser Press Would Be Welcome,,,,,
,4710,Room 46 In The Castle.  Quite Small For The (Full) Price And Should Have Had Speakers Or Dock  Kettle And Hairdryer Very Hard To Use Due To Short Cords And Inconvenient Outlets.  Again  For The Price  Fast Internet Should Be Free.,,,,,
,4711,We Would Have Appreciated Free Wi-Fi  Given The Standard Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,4712,The Bed Had A Duvee Only And No Top Sheet. This Was Mentioned To The Hotel Manager And A Sheet Was Supplied. The Fridge Was Not Working  But Was Replaced Within 15 Minutes Of Reporting To Housekeeping Manager - Excellent Service,,,,,
,4714,Only Small Points That In No Way Took Away From A Brilliant Relaxing Weekend 1 The Carton Of Milk In Fridge Was Out Of Date  Twice. Corrected As Soon As I Contacted Reception. 2 The Robes Were Synthetic And Were Prone To Static  In The Environment  Felt Cheap  Sorry.,,,,,
,4716,There Were Some Examples Of 'Ageing'.,,,,,
,4717,Appalling View Over Courtyard Very Noisy Boiler Room Noises And Linen Delivery Outside Of Window At 0600Hrs. Boiler Noise Until 2315Hrs And Woke Up With Noise At 0548. Lack Of Ability To Open Windows And Furniture Looked Secondhand And Marked With Marks On Walls In Bathroom.,,,,,
,4718,The Milk Provided For Our Tea And Coffee On The Second Day Was On The Turn.,,,,,
,4721,Grateful It Was Changed From The Noisy Rabbit Hutch On The 3Rd Floor.,,,,,
,4722,Although The Room And Position Were Lovely The Decor. Was A Little. Tired Looking Particularly The Bathroom Which Has Water Stains On The Walls.  The Furniture Also Has Marks On It.,,,,,
,4723,It Was Cold When We Arrived. We Were Told The Heating Did Not Normally Come On Until About 6:00Pm(We Arrived At 4:30Pm). A Heater Was Offered And We Took It. The Room Was Very Draughty And The Bathroom Particularly So. The Water Was Not Very Hot And The Shower Pressure Was Poor.,,,,,
,4725,Only A Fixed Head Shower In The Bath  An Additional Flexible One Would Be Preferable,,,,,
,4727,We Received An Upgrade On Arrival And This Was A Lovely Surprise And Most Appreciated.,,,,,
,4728,Apart From The Previous Comment Regarding Feather Bedding We Were Also Less Than Impressed With The Poor Quality Of The Bath Robes. For A Hotel Of Thus Standard (And Cost) We Would Have Expected Cotton Robes  Not Polyester.,,,,,
,4729,Clean & Comfortable,,,,,
,4732,Very Noisy Extractor Fan In Bathroom.,,,,,
,4737,The Walls Are Thin!!  My Bed Sheets And Pillows Were Not Smoothed Out But The Bed 'Looked'  Made.  The Bathroom Bins Were Not Emptied!!  I Put Out The Do Not Disturb Sign And Was Interrupted By A Member Of Staff Holding Out A European Plug.  It Took Me Some Time To Convince Her That I Was English And In No Need Of A European Or Any Other Plug.  She Was Quite Insistent Because Reception Had Told Her I Required One!!,,,,,
,4738,Asked For Twin Bedded Configuration When Booking  But Were Allocated A King Size Bed. Were Assured This Would Be Altered Before Retiring  But This Was Not Done. Were Surprised To Find The Sink In Bathroom Was Badly Cracked And That The Water Did Not Run Away Freely. Shower Screen Was Ineffective Re Keeping Water Inside Bath Area. ,,,,,
,4739,It Was Rather Hot In Our Room And Too Hot For Duvets But The Houeskeeper Put Sheets And Blankets On Instead.,,,,,
,4740,I Did Not Like Being Up On The Top Floor.  I Felt Like I Was Being Put Into A 'Servant's Room'.  In View Of The Overall Cost Of Our Stay  I Was Disappointed Not To Be Given A Room With A View Of The Valley  Particularly When I Know That The Rooms Opposite Were Unoccupied.  The Sink In The Bathroom Was Blocked And The Fridge Was Inoperative  Which Meant The Milk Had Gone Sour  Which I Discovered When I Made A Cup Of Tea On My Arrival.,,,,,
,4742,Our Stay Was In Room 3  At Times We Found Our Privacy Invaded Due To The Bistro Decking Being Outside Our Window  We Would Like To Suggest Some Sort Of Barrier  Possibly A Rope Station Be Placed A Few Feet From Room 3'S Windows To Stop Other Guests From Looking Into The Room.,,,,,
,4744,Excellent Standard,,,,,
,4747,No,,,,,
,4748,Wardrobe Interior Cannot Hang Dresses/Coats So Had To Hang Them On The Outside Of The Wardrobe. Lighting Very Poor In Bedroom.,,,,,
,4749,Option Of Alternative Pillows  The Pillows I Found Were Too High.  The Toiletries Were Only Given Out One For A Two Night Stay And The Two Of Us Had To Share 1 Small Bottle Of Shower Gel.  Charges Were High And Unnecessary At The Level Of This Hotel.,,,,,
,4750,It Is Outrageous That You Charge For A Decent Wifi Service,,,,,
,4751,A Handrail Above The Bath Would Have Been Essential To Me,,,,,
,4752,The Room Had No View.  There Was An Extractor Flan From Kitchen That Could Be Heard Untill  Late In The Evening And Then Woke Us Early In Morning.   As  Hotel Very Quiet An Up Grade Would Have Been Possible.,,,,,
,4754,Lack Of Mobile Phone Signal Is Disappointing,,,,,
,4756,Open Wi Fi Should Just Be Available. It Cost You Next To Nothing So Trying To Charge For It Just Adds Hassle. Make It An Unsecured Open Network  It Will Not Reach Your Neighbours,,,,,
,4758,Sadly The Room Backed Onto The Lift So Was Somewhat Noisy  Depending On The Lift Use. On The 3Rd Floor The Floorboards In The Corridor Were Very Squeeky Too,,,,,
,4760,Having Stayed Twice Before  I Was A Little Disapointed With The Room I Paid For An Upgrade Which On Reflection Was A Waste Of Money As The Room Did Look Like It Needed A Little Tlc  The Rug In The Bedroom Was Curling Up(A Safety Hazard). My Previous Visits Were When The Hotel Had Not Long Opened Up In 2003/2004 And The Rooms Were Excellent. All That Said It Is Still A Lovely Place And I Would Come Again  But Would Not Bother With The £60 Upgrade.,,,,,
,4763,Unfortunately We Did Not Have A View.,,,,,
,4764,We Felt That Internet Access Should Be Free For The Price Of The Accommodation. The Lovely View From Our Upgraded Room (48) Was A Little Marred By The Condensation Between The Sealed Unit Window Panes,,,,,
,4769,Bath / Shower Very Slippery. Why No Handles?  Where Are You Supposed To Put The Soap.,,,,,
,4773,The Shower Overflowed On To The Floor .A Better Water Proofing Is Required,,,,,
,4774,Room And Bed Were Fine  But The Power Points Were Not Well Placed For Making Tea/Coffee  Recharging Phones Etc. We Had To Crawl On The Floor By The Door (Ok For Us Now But Maybe Not If We Were In 60'S/70'S. Also  The Milk In Our Fridge Was Curdled And Had Passed Expiry Date (As Had One Of The Coffees By Several Months.),,,,,
,4779,Stains On Bathroom And Bedroom Carpet  Certain Areas Dusty  Otherwise Comfortable With Supberb Views. Overall Feel Little Attention Given To Detail Given The Class Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,4780,I Think In This Day And Age Internet Access Should Be Foc  And Not A Small Charge,,,,,
,4782,On The First Night I Noticed A Faint Smell Of Urine On Our Duvet.  The Duvet Was Promptly Replaced  Upon Our Request The Next Day.  We Were Provided With Tea And Coffee  But Would Have Appreciated Having The Milk Replenished On The Second Day.,,,,,
,4783,I Have A Mobility Problem And Was Given Room One.  This Room Was Reasonable.  It Had A Good View Of The Grounds And The Room Was Airy And The Bed Was Large And Comfortable.  The Bathroom Was Accessible And Suited My Needs.  Unfortunately It Was Necessary For Me To Move A Heavy Chair Each Time I Wished To Use/Open The Windows Or Move Around The Desk Area.  Coffee And Tea Were Provided  But The Milk And Biscuits Were Not Replenished On Our Second Day.  On The First Night I Noticed A Faint Smell Of Urine On My Duvet.  This Was Replaced As Soon As We Mentioned It The Next Day.,,,,,
,4785,Disappointed With Standard And Quality Of The Rooms (Rotting Window Frames  Stained Wall Paper In The Bathroom And Stained Glass In Windows).,,,,,
,4786,Overall Size Very Comfortable  However Room Could Use Some Updating.,,,,,
,4787,Given Grade / Standard Of Hotel  I Was Surprised That Room Door Still Needed Redecorating After Earlier Lock Change And That The Valance To The Bed Was Badly Stained On One Side,,,,,
,4792,Not As Luxurious As Expected. Needs Updating In Bathroom Stains On Blind And Curtains.  No Water Glasses In Bathroom. Dressing Gowns Poor Quality And Frayed. No Fridge.,,,,,
,4793,The Televsion In Room 19 Was So Poor That We Could Only Listen To Radio.  The Internet Connection Was Not Fit For Purpose - Connection Dropped Or Was Not Available For At Leaset 50% Of The Time.,,,,,
,4794,The Room Was 'Tired' The Bed Head Had A Stain On It And There Were Stains On The Carpet By The Bin The Hot Water Was Not Very Hot And The Hot Tap In The Bath Was Loose The Plug Chain Broke As Well! There Was Water Staining On The Wallpaper At The Ceiling In One Part Of The Room,,,,,
,4795,Ther First Room Offered Did Not Merit The Name 'Guestroom'. With The Opposite Roof Direct In Fron Of The Window It Cab Be Used For Broom Cuppoard Or Office; Not For Guests. The Replacing Room  Opposite The Stairs To The Swimming Pool Was Just About Adequate.,,,,,
,4796,Room Was Tired With Stais On Carpet Bed Headboard And On Wallpaper Hot Tap Was Loose In The Bath Fitting And Inadequate Hot Water That Evening Although Ok In Morning,,,,,
,4798,Poor Tired Stained,,,,,
,4799,It Would Be Nice To Have All King Size In A Hotel Of Your Callibre And When We Took Water Out Of The Fridge It Had Already Been Opened By Previous Guests And Not Replaced With New By Chamber Maids,,,,,
,4800,We Actually Stayed In A Lodge,,,,,
,4801,Our Room Seemed Well Used With Stains On Curtains  Bed Skirt  Carpet. Bathroom Was Not As Luxurious As Others We Have Had With Odd Raised Toilet (On Pedistal). Pillows Were Well Used  Flat And A Bit Smelly. Need To Replace With New Feather Pillows Periodically.,,,,,
,4802,The Light Coloured Bed Cover  When Looked At In Good Light Was A Bit Grubby All Over And Certainly Needed A Good Clean. No Towel Gowns Until Reqested As Our Friends Room Had   Could Have Looked Like We Had Taken Them !,,,,,
,4803,It Was Cold The Whole Time - The Radiator Was Never Hot....The Curtains Sealed The Radiator From The Room.....Items From The Previous Guests Were Still There When We Departed....The Bed Itself Was Comfortable But The Continental Quilts Were Too Heavy To Sleep Under,,,,,
,4808,Kettle Was Hard To Plug In Anywhere Other Than The Floor. Tea Was On The Weak Side  Coffee Sachets Required A Degree In Engineering To Open. My Parents Fornd The Tv Hard To Operate.,,,,,
,4809,For The Amount Paid £215 I Was Expecting Very High Quality  All I Got Was Average Bed & Breakfast In A Small (Only King Sized Bed) Shower Room That Was Like A Corridor. Decor Was Dull  The Room Was Very Noisy And Had A Large Gap At The Bottom Which Let Considerable Light In. I Have Recently Come Back From A Stay In An Excellent 4 Star Hotel In Edinburgh Which Was Cost A Quarter Of What We Paid On The Reduced Rate  And Which Offered Queen Sized Bed  Bathroom With Bath And Show  Light And Airy  Still In An Old Character Property. If It Was Not For My Friends Wedding (Which I Did Not Want To Mar)  I Would Have Complained At The Time. Also During The Wedding The First Course Was Served And Myself And One Other Member Of The Party Has Greaseproof Paper Still Under The Onion Tart - Not Exactly Firt Class.,,,,,
,4812,Overall It Was The Most Peaceful Room I Have Ever Stayed In,,,,,
,4813,Bed Was A Little Small.,,,,,
,4815,Bathroom Carpet Had White Stains On Them Which I Feel Should Not Be There In A Hotel Room With That Kind Of Price Tag...You Expect To Find That In A Travellodge!,,,,,
,4816,While Some Items Were Not As Described  We Felt We Could Always Ask Staff - They Were Superb,,,,,
,4822,   I Was Booked Into A Room I Found Very Inappropriate And Asked For A Change Which I Was Given. I Was Given A New Room Which I Was Very Happy With  Until Bedtime When All I Could All Night Was The Swimming Pool Motor Running. Not A Good Room For A Good Nights Sleep. I Had Two Very Disturbed Nights.,,,,,
,4823,Bathroom Needs To Be Refurbished,,,,,
,4825,Yes  Front Door Access Took Ages To Lock And Unlock And I Believe The Lock Needs Attention As Both Me And My Wife Struggles To Gain Entry Everytime,,,,,
,4827,Window Surrounds Clearly Sufering From Old Age And Needed Extensive Renovation Air Flap In Extraction Fan In Bathroom Stayed Closed Preventing The Fan From Functioning. Room 52 We Stayed In Was Next To The Lift And Hence Noisy,,,,,
,4830,Bit Old Fashioned. Felt Like A 1950S Room In An Edwardian Style Hotel,,,,,
,4831,Our Radiator Didn't Work. We Were Given An Electric Radiator Which Somewhat Detracted From The Experience. Very Rainy And The Rain Leaked Through The Window. Bath Plug Was Semi Blocked. Other Than That  Lovely Room.,,,,,
,4833,Excellent,,,,,
,4834,Need Somewhere In The Shower To Put The Soap,,,,,
,4837,Only Problem Was That The Bed Was Very Soft,,,,,
,4838,The Bedroom Was Cold And An Electric Heater Was Delivered To Our Room As We Were Informed That The Heating Did Not Come On Until The Evening. The Fridge Had Not Been Restocked But Was Replenished As Soon As Requested. The Towel Rail In The Bathroom Did Not Heat Up During Our Stay. The Bathroom Decoration Was Tired And The Level Of Fittings Poor. The Hand Basin Was Cracked. There Were No Towel Rails (Other Than The Non Working Heated One) So You Had To Step Out Of The Shower To Reach A Towel. No Soap Dish Or Shelf Near The Bath. The Bathroom Was Of A Very Poor Standard.,,,,,
,4840,Internet Access Was Expensive – Mobile Telephone Access Was Dreadful – The Room Although Well Cleaned Was Beginning To Feel Shabby And Tired,,,,,
,4843,Room 40  Toilet Inefficient And Noisy Easily Removable Stains On Carpets.,,,,,
,4844,A Little On The Small Side Versus The Price Paid,,,,,
,4845,See Previous Comments About Need Fro Refurbishment/ Decoration.,,,,,
,4846,Radiator In Bathroom Erratic,,,,,
,4849,There Was Not Enough Light And A Shortage Of Accessible Sockets.,,,,,
,4856,We Were In The East Facing Chairmans Suite.  The Doors To The Bathroom Are V Heavy & Incredibly Difficult To Open With Round Brass Handles  If Your Hands Are Wet Or Greasy It's Impossible.  Also Could Not Find Any Socket Near A Mirror For Hair Dryer   Except In The Bottom Of The Wardrobe Cupboard.  The Lampshade On The Standard Lamp Is V Tatty & Broken.  Bathroom Floor Very Slippery When Wet.  We Liked The Bedroom Very Much....These Are Just Meant To Be Helpful Comments,,,,,
,4859,Very Good Size Suite ( Room 11) Bigger Than Expected!:) Very Nice Indeed - Good Facilities In Room- Sky/ Free Wifi / - Perhaps Ironing Board Would Be Useful In Room? . Very Nice Towels And Products In Bathroom Too And Good Hair Dryer :)) Bed Very Comfy And The Little Touches For The Dog V Nice Too !,,,,,
,4861,Lovely Room ,,,,,
,4863,Clean And Beautifully Appointed,,,,,
,4867,Full Length Mirror On Reverse Of Bathroom Door  Not Ideal. ,,,,,
,4868,It Was Spacious And Comfortable.  As A Very Minor Comment  The Hot Water Ran Out By Around 7Pm.,,,,,
,4870,We Were Offered And Accepted An Upgrade To A Valley Room For £40 Per Night Which Frankly Was Not Value For Money Since The Windows Were "Steamed Up" All Day So We Could Not Enjoy The Views. I Can't Help Feeling That Someone Did Or Should Have Known About This And A More Modest Supplement Charged.,,,,,
,4871,The Water Stains Around Teh Bath In The Bathroom Were A Pity - For Such An Expensive Room,,,,,
,4873,We Went To Use The Trays In The Oven In Our Lode And We Had To Clean Them As They Had Not Been Cleaned Prioir To Our Visit,,,,,
,4881,Thought The Bathrooms Could Do With Being Replaced  My Sink Had A Huge Chip On The Corner,,,,,
,4885,The Matting In The Bathroom Was A Little Weird - It's Like The Floor Of A Public Gym/Lavatory.  I Would Recommend Tile.  It Was The Only Thing That Was Cheap/Off About The Room.   The Throw Blanket Over The Bed Was Also Stained A Little And Dirty.,,,,,
,4886,Bedroom Was A Little Tired.,,,,,
,4889,Spacious,,,,,
,4894,The Bedroom Was Lovely And Cosy Which Was Very Enjoyable On A Cold Weekend.,,,,,
,4895,Very Swift And Good Housekeeping.,,,,,
,4897,The Bathroom Was Slightly Dated Compared To Our Last Room On A Previous Visit,,,,,
,4900,Room 54  Move The Wardrobe  Not Enough Room To Get To That Side Of The Bed ,,,,,
,4901,Internet Access Was Spotty Within The Lodge.  One Of The Downstairs Shower In Our Lodge Leaked Terribly And The Floor Tiles Were Floating On The Water.,,,,,
,4904,The Bed Was Exceptionally Comfortable,,,,,
,4905,Lighting For Reading Could Be Improved And We Could Have Done With Somewhere To Rest Our Suitcase. Also Tv Could Be Repositioned To Be Visible From Armchair As Well As The Bed But Minor Quibbles,,,,,
,4906,We Thought That The Two Bedside Cabinets Spoilt The Masterbedroom Slightly And Were Out Of Place Given The Style Of Property.,,,,,
,4907,The Sink In The Bathroom Was Cracked Which We Feel Should Of Been Addressed.  Disturbance (Rats Nesting In The Roof Space) During The Night Which Woke My Wife At 2Am And Continued Which Meant That We Had To Be Moved Rooms At 4.30 In The Morning.,,,,,
,4908,The Shower Door Doesn't Close Properly. The Internal Doors Could Do With Being Able To Be Wedged Open,,,,,
,4909,Didn't Try To Access Internet So Wasn't Applicable!,,,,,
,4913,You Really Need To Get Internet Sorted In The Lodges  Its Ridiculous Not To Have Any Reception In The Lodges Both For Mobile Phones Or Internet The Lodges Looked Tired And Worn In Places. The Carpets Were Stained And Dirty In Places. I Think You Should Not Allow People With Dogs To Keep Them In The Lodges. The Carpets Needed A Clean.,,,,,
,4915,The Offer Of Stair Gates For People With Young Children Would Be A Thoughtful Touch.,,,,,
,4918,Would Have Liked Some Tissues And Gluten Free And Dairy Free Biscuits Every Day (Only Provided On Arrival Day),,,,,
,4925,Television Signal Was Awful.,,,,,
,4929,All First Class. ,,,,,
,4930,Please See Previous Note,,,,,
,4932,I Had A Confirmation Email Dated 26Th September 2013 Confirming Our Booking For A Classic Room Which The Bovey Castle Website Describes As Having Restricted Views.  Our Room Had No View  We Looked Onto Drain Pipes  Flues And Roof Tiles.  Noise From The Flue's Woke Us At 7 Am Which Was Improved When We Shut Our Window.  If This Was The Only Room Available When We Booked In September  It Would Have Been Useful To Have Been Warned  So We Could Have Had The Opportunity To Make Alternative Arrangements.,,,,,
,4937,I Had Asked For A Room With A View  Particularly As My Husband Had Stayed Before But Our Rom(47) Looked Over The Car Park.,,,,,
,4939,The Lighting Levels Were Very Low,,,,,
,4940,As Previously Noted A Handgrip In The Bath Would Be Helpful.,,,,,
,4941,The Lodges Are In Need Of Some Up-Dating And Re-Decoration.,,,,,
,4942,No,,,,,
,4948,Clean And Airy  With Warm Bathroom Floors A Bonus. Decor Perfectly Acceptable Although Beginning To Be A Little Tired And Dated.,,,,,
,4955,It Was Fine But The Location Was Disappointing With A View Of The Yard And The Car Park. I Understood The Room May Only Have Partial Views But Partial Views Of A Wall And Carpark Were Unexpected,,,,,
,4956,Yes  Could Have Been More Luxurious  Especially Bathroom  To Match The Rest Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,4958,Rooms Were Ver Hot,,,,,
,4959,Not Enough Electric Sockets  Especially For The Kettle,,,,,
,4963,The Internet Was Not Acceptable For Such A High Quality Hotel. Even At Premier Inns/Low Cost Hotels Etc The Internet Is Far More Accessible And Usually Free. I Was Disappointed With The Wifi - Particularly When I Wished To Access Emails For Work Purposes. ,,,,,
,4966,Sorry Did This On Previous Page.,,,,,
,4974,Mattress Seemed To Be 2 Single Ones Zipped Together   At This Price Level I Would Expect A Full Mattress ,,,,,
,4975,On Arrival The Room Felt A Little Chilly.  I Was Very Quickly Provided With An Electric Heater Which Soon Warmed The Room. ,,,,,
,4979,It Would Have Been Nice To Have Been Warned About The Brown Shower Water Before I Got To My Room.  Would Have Removed The Element Of Surprise As It Was Perfectly Understandable.,,,,,
,4985,Would Have Liked A View Of The Course. Bathroom Poor,,,,,
,4986,It Was Super Clean  But We Had Hammering Early In The Morning You Should Not Hire The Rooms Near Any Maintenance Scheduled,,,,,
,4991,The Narrowness Of Path And Presence Of A "Boulder" Blocking The Exit Made Manouvering The Vehicle Difficult When Unloading.,,,,,
,4992,The Lodge's Are Beautiful.  Our Kids Couldn't Believe Their Eyes.  The Service Was Fabulous (They Even Cleaned Our Dishes  Which We Were Going To Fo Later).  Lots Of Space  Well Equipped  And Relaxing.  Dark And Quiet At Night.  Lying In Bed In The Darkness And Listening To The Owls In The Grounds Was So Lovely,,,,,
,4994,We Had No Hot Water During The Full Stay  Issue With The Boiler!,,,,,
,4996,Bit Of A Prblem That There Was No Water In The Bathroom For Several Hours Due To Engineering Malfunction With Reservoir,,,,,
,4997,Television Volume Didn't Work But Rectified On Request,,,,,
,4998,Not Enough Toilet Roll.,,,,,
,4999,No,,,,,
,5003,Room Was Comfortable  Although Rather Hot At Night And Window Fastenings Not Secure To Leave Open In A Breeze. (Room 48),,,,,
,5009,Although We Had A View Over The Golf Course  It Was Obscured By The Brickwork Outside. We Requested A Six Foot Bed And Were Declined But Our Fellow Guest Party Had One! Next Time We Will Ask To Be On The First Floor Overlooking The Golf Course And With A Six Foot Bed And That Will Be Perfect!,,,,,
,5014,Black Mould In Corner Of Shower. Shower Door Doesn't Close. Really Bad Sediment And Colour In Water ( Due To Heavy Rain?) Quite Off Putting To Shower/Bathe/Wash/Brush Teeth Etc Bed Valance Not On Properly  Under The Bed Not Cleaned (Pieces Of Paper Underneath) Coffee Sachets Out Of Date! ,,,,,
,5015,Please See Earlier Comments,,,,,
,5016,The Water From The Tap Was So Greeny Grey That I Felt Bad Brushing My Teeth Using It.  The Toiletries And Basic Food And Drink Supplies Were Very Welcome Thank You,,,,,
,5018,I Thought That The Beds Were Supposed To Be Large.  I Think That Ours Was 4' 6" Which Is Smaller Than Mine At Home.   The Room Was Much Too Hot At Night And We Did Not Sleep Well  As The Duvet Was So Thick.  The Bathroom Was Freezing As There Is A Hole In The Window  Just Where You Have A Wash  And The Towel Rail Was Never Was More Than Lukewarm. We Did Not Have A Bath Or Shower Because Of This.  As This Room Is Rather Small You Need To Move Some Of The Furniture.  We Moved The Case Stand To Beside The Desk  As You Walk Into It When You Come In The Door.  The Door On The Wardrobe Needs To Be Able To Go Right Back  As Makes It Impossible To Get Round It When It Is Open.   The Chair At The Desk Needs To Be Higher As It Is Not Easy To Use A Laptop.,,,,,
,5019,The Only Thing I Would Say In Room 19 Is That When Drying Your Hair You Have To Sit At The Desk And Switch Off The Table Lamp To Plug In The Hairdryer  This Means The Lighting Is Not Very Good And Also The Mirror For The Shorter Person Was A Bit High On The Wall.,,,,,
,5021,Would Like To Have Had A Bath Rather Thna Just A Shower ,,,,,
,5022,Despite The Size Of The Bathroom  There Was No Separate Shower. The Over-Bath Shower Would Have Been Inaccessible To Those Who Are Not Able To Step Into The Bath. The Bath Itself Did Not Have A Non-Slip Surface  Making Showering Hazardous. There Was No Grab-Rail. There Was No Emergency Alarm In Case Of Accidents  ,,,,,
,5024,Lovely!,,,,,
,5030,Was Unpleasant To Have A Bath Or Shower As Water Was Dirty.  I Think They Had Had Problems With Warer Pipes/,,,,,
,5031,No,,,,,
,5036,The Pipes Were A Bit Old And Made A Noise  Also Toilet Blocked.,,,,,
,5037,We Booked Two Lodges For Our Stay The First Lodge Was Great  The Second Lodge Was Cold  No Hit Water As There Were Problems With The Boiler - Which Was A Bit Mbarrasing For Me As I Had Arranged A Private Function. The Kitchen Was No Fully Equipped  But Between The Two We Managed To Make Up All The Necessuties We Needed. There Needs To Be A List Stating What Is In Each Kitchen  And This Be Checked Each Time A New Party Arrive In The Lodges. ,,,,,
,5039,Gorgeous! ,,,,,
,5040,See Comments Above,,,,,
,5041,Fridge & Proper Milk Would Have Been Nice  B&Bs Can Do It.,,,,,
,5042,Lodge Is A Very Comfortable Set Up For Our Family,,,,,
,5044,Bathroom Was A Little Tired And Fan Did Not Work. Fridge Also Was Not Working But Was Quickly Replaced Once Reported. Overall Good Size   Nice Temperature  Comfy Bed And Clean And Tidy  Fresh Milk For Tea And Coffee And Range Of Tea And Coffee Excellent.,,,,,
,5046,Room 47 Was Very Hot Even With All The Windows Left Open!!  ,,,,,
,5048,Our Suite Was Lovely,,,,,
,5050,  The Doors To The Lodge Were Very Hard To Lock. By The 4Th Day We Had Mastered Locking The 1St Floor Door (But Locked The Others From Inside & Exited From The 1St Flr). This Theoretically Put Our Belongings At Risk  And We Were Never Shown The Technique Needed.       The Top Floor Shower Could Not Contain The Water From The Floor. Although A Common Problem  There Must Be A Better Containment System.    On Our Last Night - 5:00Am Fri 27Th - A Smoke Alarm Went Off. We Were Sharply Awoken  And Called The Front Desk. A Man Told Us He'd Send Someone To Deal With It. Then  A Couple Of Minutes Later  The Full Fire Alarm Went Off. This Is An Excruciating Noise  And It Sent Our Dog Into A Frenzy  Aside From Having All 4 Of Us Up In Various States Of Panic. I Called Again And Was Told Where To Find The Code To Stop The Alarm. Although This Was Caused By A Power Cut  Not Very Many Guests Were Effected. The Hotel Did Not Refer To It Later Nor Apologise For The Disruption. We Were Very Surprised This Did Not Get More Attention From Federico.  ,,,,,
,5053,The Accommodation In The Lodge Was Excellent With Everything We Needed And More. It Was Clean And Comfortable And Could Not Be Faulted,,,,,
,5055,We Were Too Hot But Were Able To Adjust The Heating.,,,,,
,5057,  The Doors To Our Lodge (C2) Were Hard To Lock. It Took Till Day 4 To Figure Out How To Lock The First Floor Door  And We Had To Lock The Lower Doors From Inside To Secure The Lodge. Theoretically Our Belongings Were At Risk For 3 Days And Clearly The Locks Were Not In Good Working Order.    The Top Floor Shower Sprayed Onto The Bathroom Floor. There Should Be A Better Containment System Than The One In Place.    On Our Last Night - Fri 27Th  5:00Am - We Were Woken By A Smoke Alarm. We Called The Front Desk And Were Told Someone Would Come Over To Fix It. A Few Minutes Later  The Full Fire Alarm Went Off; An Excruciating Noise Which Sent Our Dog Into A Frenzy  And Woke The Rest Of The Family Who Were By Then In Various Stages Of Distress. We Called Again And Were Told Where The Code Could Be Found To Stop The Alarm. The Problem Was Started By A Power Cut  But We Discovered Later It Only Affected A Few Guests. Given The Seriousness  We Were Surprised The Hotel Did Not Later Mention It  And We Wonder If Federico Even Knew?,,,,,
,5061,Carpets Need Updating.,,,,,
,5068,Bit Cold To Start With (Maybe Because Of The Power Cut). Could Hear Next Door When They Were Using The Bathroom/Toilet  Also Could Hear Them.  Could Hear The Lift (As Right Next To It).,,,,,
,5069,Too Dirty.  Very Worn.  ,,,,,
,5070,Room 52 Has A Broken Window  And Signs Of Water Ingress.  Not Really Up To Standard.,,,,,
,5071,For Younger Members Of The Family It Would Have Been Nice If The Tv Had Worked So That You Could Actually Hear It.  When I Called Reception They Advised There Had Been A Problem With The Volume But They Could Not Resolve It For That Night.,,,,,
,5072,Lacking In Drawers For Clothing ,,,,,
,5073,The Wallpaper Was Peeling In Some Rooms,,,,,
,5074,No Ironing Board In Room But Was Able To Get One Very Quickly,,,,,
,5076,Showerhead Leaking Around The Sides. Some Signs Of Wear And Tear Particularly In Bathroom,,,,,
,5079,I Much Appreciated That You Keep The Entire Hotel Pleasantly Warm  Including The Bedrooms!,,,,,
,5089,Redecoration Definitely Needed,,,,,
,5090,The Bathroom Had A Couple Of Areas That Needed Attention To Bring It Up To The Same Standard As The Room (Wallpaper Slightly Coming Away From The Wall  Some If The Tiles Looked Yellow). There Was Also Nowhere To Plug In The Kettle Other Than On The Floor Which Didn't Seem The Best Place.   It Would Also Have Been Nice To Have Had A Few More Breakfast Tea Bags Rather Than Only Two Of Each Flavour That Were Available.,,,,,
,5094,I Would Have Liked Another Room A Little Better I Think But It Was Booked By Our Friends Not Ourselves. It Was Very Comfortable And When We Required A Maintenance Man For A Minor Job It Was Done In A Flash. Excellent Service.,,,,,
,5095,Bedroom 48: The Dressing Table Would Have Been Better With A Mirror At A Lower Level So It Could Be Used When Sitting Down At The Dressing Table. The Wardrobe Was Rather Awkward To Open And Would Not Stay Fastened Without Some Effort Involved  Also Not Enough Length For Evening Dresses To Hang. The King Size Bed As Very Comfortable And Walk-In Shower Appreciated.  Overall Our Bedroom Was Acceptable With A Good View Of The Downs Area.,,,,,
,5098,The Lodge Far Exceeded Our Expectations,,,,,
,5100,Very Noisey From Lift And Noisey Late Night/3.00A.M. Guest Going To Their Rooms,,,,,
,5103,See Comments Already Previously Made. To Summarise Our Rooms Were Shabby  Poor And Not Very Clean. I Had To Ask Twice To Have My Sheets Changed. My Daughter Had An Accident  I Asked The Room Cleaner To Change The Sheets. He Didn't But Just Made It With Blood Stained Sheets So I Had To Ring Housekeeping To Ask Them To Have The Sheets Changed. ,,,,,
,5104,We Found The Bed Very Small.  I Think It Was A Double And We Have An Emperor At Home So We Seemed To Be Bumping Into And Kicking Each Other A Lot.  Apart From That The Bedroom Was Lovely.,,,,,
,5105,We Experienced Heavy Rain Whilst We Were Staying At Bovey And Our Bedroom Windows Leaked Badly Which Was Unfortunate For The Hotel. Our Room Was A Little Cold In The Evenings As The Radiator Did Not Warm Up Sufficiently.,,,,,
,5106,It Would Have Been Better For Me At New Year To Have Had A Full Length Wardrobe Rather Than A Converted Linen Press Which Is Really A Gent's Wardrobe Only.  Also Being On The Ground Floor We Felt It Necessary To Have The Curtains Drawn At All Times As People Could Access The Terrace Outside Our Room And Look In. It Was Slightly Noisy In The Night With People Going In And Out Of The Bistro And The Door Banging Each Time.,,,,,
,5107,Very Warm!,,,,,
,5110,A Bit Hot Over Night To Be Honest (But We Could Have Opened A Window!),,,,,
,5113,See Previous Comments - Our Lodge B2  Guest And Master Bathroom In Desperate Need Of Redecorating :-( And Nobody Apologised To Us For This :-( Also The Master Bedroom Needed A Black Out Blind On The Smaller Window (Only Had A Venetian Blind Which Lets The Light In   Otherwise The Layouts Excellent And Kids Loved It :-),,,,,
,5115,No Phone Connection So Had To Use Telephone In Room  But That Is Not A Bovey Problem,,,,,
,5120,The Staff  Generally  Did A Very Good Job At Ensuring Our Lodge Was Clean And Tidy  Making It All Very Welcoming.  However  I Would Ask Them To Make A Point Of Checking Under Furniture (I Found Dried Brussel Sprouts Under The Sofa From A Previous Guest) And Dusting All Cobwebs Off The Light Fittings And Furnishings.,,,,,
,5123,Suite Was Not Quite As Superior As We Were Expecting - Car Park Facing  Room Smaller Than Expected. Decor And Comfort Were Fine.,,,,,
,5126,As Previously Mentioned  The Room Was Fairly Small  Bathroom Cramped And Poorly Designed. Tv/Bovey Entertainment Was Terrible! I Accept We Booked One Of The Cheapest Rooms Though So Perhaps Things Are Much Better In The Suites. I Thought The Wifi Limit Of 1Mb Was A Little Bit Mean These Days.,,,,,
,5127,Exceptionally Hot  Even With All Windows Open And All Radiators Turned Off. ,,,,,
,5129,Loved The Wallpaper And My Husband Liked The Peat Bath!,,,,,
,5131,The Box Of Teas/Coffee And Nice Large Cups Was Very Welcome And The Fresh Milk In The Fridge Rather Than Little Containers.  Good Individual Bedside Lights. Perhaps Rather A Small Wardrobe If Staying For A Week.,,,,,
,5132,In View Of The Cost  The Size Of The Room And The Decor And Facilities And Comparing It With Other Similiar Hotelswhich We Have Stayed In  It Was Bearly Adequate. However As Mentioned Already The Ajacient Lift And Noisy Hallway Was A Significant Issue. This Was Not Mentioned When We Checked Out Because The Queue Was Long And We Didn't Want Hold Everyone Up.,,,,,
,5133,Our Room 17 Had Very Noisy Pipes Making A Noise Throught The Night And I Didn't Sleep Well At All :( I Did Mention To Staff The Next Morning,,,,,
,5134,It Was Cold At The Beginning  But They Arranged That For Us. ,,,,,
,5135,It Was Ok Given The Monies Paid.  Maybe You Should Look At The Stains On The Balance Of The Bed (Right-Hand Side) And Form Your Own Conclusion,,,,,
,5137,The Lodge Was Amazing,,,,,
,5139,A Double Ended Bath Would Have Been Nicer. In Hotels We Have Stayed In Elsewhere...Of This Class....A Walk In Shower Has Always Been Present. ,,,,,
,5140,The Room And The Overall Design Was Fine. Shabby Chick. Does Not Need To Be Perfect. But The Bathroom Needs A Bit Of An Update...No Hand Shower!!! The Big Dining Room Could  In Normal Use  Also Be A Bit More Tastefully Decorated,,,,,
,5141,My Bedroom Was Lovely  Enjoyed The Lovely Teas And Hot Chocolate Great Idea,,,,,
,5145,The Bedroom Was Gorgeous And We Were Very Happy With It And The Bathroom. A Few Minor Observations In The Bathroom - A Cracked Tile  Some Discoloured Tile Grout Around The Bath Taps  Robes A Little Frayed  But In A Way  This All Adds To The Charm And For Us Certainly Did Not Detract From The Comfort. ,,,,,
,5148,A Little Tired But Still Gorgeous ,,,,,
,5149,See Previous Comment Box.,,,,,
,5150,Lovely Room. Warm And Comfortable. The Shower Was Super Although Both My Wife And I Found Standing In The Bath A Very Slippery Experience.,,,,,
,5151,Lovely Size And The Fact That It Is Near The Stairs Did Not Mean It Was Noisy Because Of The Second Internal Door,,,,,
,5152,Needed Painting Stains On The Ceiling,,,,,
,5153,Would Love A Little Fridge And Fresh Milk In The Rooms,,,,,
,5156,Seems Odd That There Is No Where In Bathroom To Hang Bath Robes And Seemed Wrong To Have To Hang Damp Robes In A Wardrobe ??? Limited Hanging Space If Staying More Than One Night For Two People ,,,,,
,5159,Internet Access Worked But Was Very Slow Indeed.  Condensation From The Windows (Room 37) Left Pools Of Water On The Windowsill Which Subsequently Soaked Belongings Left On There!,,,,,
,5160,The Window Was Broken And Rattley We Did Report On Checkout,,,,,
,5161,Room 28 Was Quite Musky When We Arrived And There Were Water Damage Marks Near The Windows And A Small Area Had Been Damaged In The Main Room.  The Roller Blind In The Bathroom Had Seen Better Days!!  ,,,,,
,5163,Could Do With A Table To Put The Kettle On As We Had To Plug It In On The Floor. Would Be Difficult For Someone Older To Manage. ,,,,,
,5166,The Lighting Was Poor And Really Needs Sorting Out.  Relying On One Central Light And Two Bed Side Lamps Is Simply Not Good Enough Today.  Additional Modern Lighting Should Be Added  Especially For Reading. The Bathroom Was Ok  But An Update Would Be Beneficial  Including A Sliding/Removable Shower Head.,,,,,
,5167,Much Appreciated A Room On The First Floor With A Beautiful View. Lovely Size. Having Had Two Experiences At The Hotel I Feel It Is Fair Too Say The Décor/Bedspreads Are A Little Tired In Areas. I Do Not Like The Cartons Of Milk In The Room Preferring Fresh. However Your Staff Changed This Promptly When Asked.,,,,,
,5168,Perfect,,,,,
,5169,Comfortable  Beautifully Deacorated,,,,,
,5171,The Clear Glass In The Bathroom Meant There Was No Privacy From Other Guests On Outside Terrace.  We Had To Keep The Blind Down.,,,,,
,5174,Surprised No Table To Put Kettle On...Had To Plug In And Leave On Floor Which Is Quite Dangerous Especially For Elderly/Infirm.,,,,,
,5175,It Was A Lovely Room  The Bathroom Décor Needed Refurbishing As Previously Described  (New Bath Panel  Work On Splashback On Washbasin).,,,,,
,5176,Slightly In Need Of A Refresh  But Clean And Well Presented. Some Of The Furnishings Were A Little Worn.  Really Comfortable Bed. Central Heating Good  Was Expecting It To Be Cold  Given Age And Size Of Building( Previously Stayed At Rhinefield House Hotel In New Forest  Similar 'Chateau Type Design'  But It Was Freezing There)).Views Over The Valley From Our Bedroom Window Were Stunning!  ,,,,,
,5178,The Bathroom Blind In Number 35 Needs Replacing Did Not Say Forgot But Coming Back This Weekend So Was Going To Mention Then Its A Bit Mouldy Only Mentioning As I Look After Holiday Homes And Would Be One Thing That My Customers Would Pick Up On.,,,,,
,5179,The Bathroom Was In Need Of Decor/ Modernising,,,,,
,5180,Too Hot,,,,,
,5181,Possible Minus Would Be Uht Milk In The Room To Be Fair I Think A Small Fridge And Fresh Milk Should Be Possible. Smelly Bathroom Floor Towel Rail Only Partially Hot. ,,,,,
,5188,The Lodge Was Very Well Equipped And We Were Impressed With The Provision Of Milk Snd Cereals Snd Bread For Breakfast.  The Lodge Was Warm And Welcoming With A Lit Fire And Was Very Clean. ,,,,,
,5190,Only One Comment - Room 56 (I Think We Stayed In) The Right Hand Curtain Has A Massive Stain On It - I Think Its Coffee. My Mums Room - 39 She Said There Were Also Coffee Staisn On The Carpet And I Think Curtains. (This Is Only Feedback To Help You If You Had Not Spotted Them!),,,,,
,5191,There Were Water Stains On The Ceiling From A Previous Leaking Roof. No Top Sheet On The Bed Which We Prefer Rather Than Just The Duvet. The Basin Plug Would Not Stay In  So Could Not Fill With Water. Other Than The Above  The Room Was Comfortable With Good Facilities  Though Would Have Preferred A Room Stat To Control The Heating.,,,,,
,5193,I Didn't Think My Room Was Commensurate With The Rate I Paid. I Appreciate That Secret Escapes Allows Hotels To Fill In Rooms Unbooked  But My Expectation Was Something More Ostentatious  As Shown In The Brochures And Online.,,,,,
,5194,Our Room 29 Did Not Have A Mirror By A Plug In Order To Use Hair Dryer Etc When Getting Ready For The Evening. This Made The Process A Bit Awkward. ,,,,,
,5195,Bedroom/ Bathroom Needs Updating  Water Stains Down Side Of Bath And Walls And Carpets Old. Tired Looking Which Unfortunately Didnt Match Rest Of The Hotel,,,,,
,5197,My Friend And I Did Find The Room Very Warm  But We Turned Off The Heating And Opened The Window!  I Appreciate With All The Real Fires Lite Downstairs The Heat Is Going To Rise.,,,,,
,5199,The Doors Had Dirty Handprints On Them  Cleaning Them Would Have Been Easy,,,,,
,5203,Very Well Set Out. Could Have Done With A Plug With Better Distance To The Mirror Since With A Hair-Dryer/Straighteners. Beautiful Wallpaper/Pictures,,,,,
,5205,Very Clean See Earlier Comment About Pillows  I Love Elemis Products So 10/10 For Those. ,,,,,
,5207,Tea Making Facilities Were Good - China Lovely - But Still No Receptacle For Used Tea Bags!  Stay In Many Hotels And Never Found One Yet.,,,,,
,5208,We Were Given Room 41  Which Was Nice  However Noisy Due To Being Located Near A Lift. This Was A Shame,,,,,
,5209,Although It Was A Castle Room It Was Rather Small  It Did Make Up For This By The Lovely View.,,,,,
,5210,It Is A Bit Noisy With The Exhaust From The Kitchen And Carts Moving Things About. ,,,,,
,5211,Very Poor For This Standard Of Hotel And Not What Our Friends Have Experienced.The Bed Was Very Comfortable For My Bad Back. The Room Needs Re-Decorating And The Bathroom Sanitary Ware Replacing And Floorings Changed. We Have Been In Luxury B&B's With Superior Rooms Albeit Smaller.,,,,,
,5213,We Received A Free Upgrade Which Was Appreciated. ,,,,,
,5218,Stayed Room 28  Carpets To Room Need Replacing Cobwebs In Bathroom Irritating Droplets Outside Bedroom Window Through Night  Blind In Bathroom Badly Stained,,,,,
,5219,We Appreciated The Water Bottles Being Replenished.,,,,,
,5220,I Was Disappointed That The Bathroom Decor Was A Little Tired Primarily Around The Bath Itself,,,,,
,5221,Disappointed That The Water Didn't Get Hot - Apparently There Was A Fault But It Meant I Had A Luke-Warm Bath. As Only There One Night It Spoilt The Luxury A Bit. I Was Surprised No Mention Was Made At Check-Out. I Guess I Should Have Brought It Up Again. ,,,,,
,5223,Even Though Over The Kitchen I Loved It.,,,,,
,5224,The Bathroom Is Looking A Bit Tired  With Water Stains On The Roller Blind And The Bath's Front Panel Looking Stained - Which I Appreciate Is A Normal Part Of Frequent Useage. ,,,,,
,5227,N/A,,,,,
,5228,We Asked To Be Moved From Our First Room As It Was Noisy (It Was Above The Pool). The Options Given To Us After Was An Upgrade And A Smaller Option Of The Same Type. We Decided To Stay With The Same Type Of Room Which Was Smaller And Had A Smaller Bed. ,,,,,
,5229,If I Was To Be Picky Perhaps A Touch Of Decorating Needed On The Window Sills And Bath Panel.,,,,,
,5230,Bedroom 19 Noisy From 6 In Morning Due To Being Above Reception Bathroom Looking Tired Needs Attention,,,,,
,5233,Tv Remote Control Was Tricky,,,,,
,5235,A Beautiful Room  Very Relaxing Space  Quiet And Spacious. ,,,,,
,5240,Too Warm!,,,,,
,5245,Charming Room. Not Boring 'Corporate' Decor,,,,,
,5247,Room 40 Gets Very Hot,,,,,
,5249,The Rooms Need Some Tlc.... The Headboard Was Heavily Stained  There Was Black Mold Around The Window And A Water Leak Stain On The Ceiling.,,,,,
,5257,Although I Enjoyed The Stay And The Service From The Staff Was Excellent  My Room Was The First On The Right Up The Stairs. Due To The Age And Charm Of The Building The Floor Boards In The Hall Creaked And Made A Lot Of Noise Each Time Someone Came Up The Stairs And Walk Past. This Sounded Like Someone Was Outside My Door. I Also Found The Layout Of This Room A Bit Odd But Understand It Is Due To The Age And Layout Of The Building. ,,,,,
,5260,We Stayed On A Travelzoo Promotion And Was Put Into Room 1 Which Is Obviously For Disabled.  Did Not Like Lay Out Of Bathroom With Shower Right Next To Toilet And No Screens So We Were Wading About A Bit In Water. Actual Bedroom Was Lovely.,,,,,
,5269,I Think In A Hotel Of This Quality The Wi-Fi Internet Access Should Be Free. Even Travel Lodge Gives Free Internet.,,,,,
,5270,The Shower Room Was A Bit Of A Let Down And The Pluming To The Toilet Was Rather Noisey,,,,,
,5279,Very Pleased To Have Received An Upgrade. Made Us Feel Special So Thank You. ,,,,,
,5280,Whoever Designed The Bathrooms Should Be Shot ! I Hear It Was A Designer London Company .. What A Waste Of Money .. Probably The Worst Bathrooms I Have Seen In A Hotel Of This Quality,,,,,
,5281,Gorgeous Room With Lovely Bathroom And Toiletries!  It Was Splendid.
I Didn't Even Try To Use Internet!,,,,,
,5288,The Room Was Extremely Warm - Even With The Window Open. Would Be Nice To Be Able To Control The Heat Better In The Bedroom. The Mattress Was Very Soft - I Know Some People Like That But For Us  A Firm Mattress Is Much Preferred. The Internet Was Quick And Worked Really Well. The Bathroom And Shower Were Superb And The Prosecco Which Was Part Of Our Deal Was Lovely. ,,,,,
,5290,Was Not As Nice Room As First Stay,,,,,
,5294,Was A Little Hot,,,,,
,5295,Our Party Had To Move Rooms Which Was Frustrating,,,,,
,5296,It Was A Bit To Hot In The Room ,,,,,
,5299,No Window In The Bathroom Would Open And Only One In The Bedroom. Not A Big Problem In Winter But Would Be Unbearable In Summer. 
Fridge With Water /Milk And The Tea/Coffee Were Appreciated.
There Was Mo Light Bulb In The Desk Light. We Asked The Turn Down Man To Supply One But It Never Arrived. He Was Of Foreign Nationality And Perhaps Had Not Understood.,,,,,
,5302,Would Have Preferred A Bigger Room.,,,,,
,5303,The Room Was Furnished Very Much In Keeping With The Architecture Of The House.  The Facilities Within The Room Were Exactly What We Needed.  The Bed Was Exceptionally Comfortable.,,,,,
,5304,The Sink Was Cracked And Bath Chipped ,,,,,
,5305,Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,5307,Our Lodge Was Nicely Presented  But I Think It Needed A Bit Of Decoration.
You Get The Feeling The Lodges And The Hotel Now Need A Bit Of Money Spent On Them In Certain Areas.,,,,,
,5308,Separate Shower Cubicle In Addition To The Bath Would Be Better As The Bathroom Was Huge,,,,,
,5317,We Stayed In Room Number 2 - It Was Lovely - Beautiful View ! Perfectly Situated For Access To Swimming Pool   Spa And Restaurant ! ,,,,,
,5318,No - It Was Perfect - And The Dog Stayed With Us In The Room - Brilliant!,,,,,
,5319,Bedroom Very Nice  Good Beds  Stunning View. Wardrobe Drawer Space To Great. No Hooks For Bath Robes. Possibly  The Least Good Was The Bathroom ~ Just A Little Outdated & Not Quite Sufficient Shelving. ,,,,,
,5320,We Stopped In Room 21 I Think. It Was A Standard Room So I Was Very Pleased With The Size Of It. However  The Bathroom Only Had One Light In It Which Meant That The Toilet Was A Little Dark. The Most Disappointing Aspect Was The Paint On The Windowsill Was Peeling And Required Some Attention. I Wouldn't Expect This In A Hotel Which Costs This Much A Night!,,,,,
,5323,Room Was Ok.  We'd Booked On A Special Offer So I Had Lower Expectations Than I Usually Would.  Had I Paid Full Price I Would Have Been Disappointed.  It Was Adequate But Nothing Special,,,,,
,5325,The Room Was Very Comfortable With An Excellent Choice Of Teas.,,,,,
,5326,Winter Duvet Should Have Been On The Bed Not A Summer One.,,,,,
,5327,We Stayed In Room 44 - To Be Frank It Would Be Very Easy To Find Fault And Write A Very Long Comment On Trip Advisor - I Enjoyed Our Stay And The Staff Both Front Of House And Housekeeping Made Up For It But The Room Was On The Tired Side And Extremely Hot. Blinds In The Bathroom Stained  Wall Paper Marked  Marks To The Paint Work - All In All It Needs A Redo - Housekeeping Is Ok - Tell Them To Dust The Top Of The Wardrobes ! - I Put My Sports Bag Up There And It Was Thick With Dust. The Bathroom Of A Hotel Of Your Standard Really Needed A Seperate Shower Or One That Was Too Close To The Edge Of The Bath So You Could Get Under It - Also A Bigger Shelf Over The Basin.   ,,,,,
,5328,Shame Rose Cottage Was "Out Of Action" As It Was More To Our Taste Re Traditional Cosy Atmosphere  However  Jaystone Was Light Bright And Modern. Different But Just As Comfortable.,,,,,
,5329,Beautifully Decorated And Thoughtful  We Had Everything We Needed.,,,,,
,5330,Very Noisy Adverse Weather But Severe Wind Noise And Clanking From Roof All Night. Noisier Than Expected Room Lovely Otherwise.,,,,,
,5331,Room 13 Was Draughty - We Were Moved To Room 44  Then Upgraded To 51 ,,,,,
,5334,Lovely Room & Well Sound Proofed  Shame The Couple In The Next Room Had A Huge Row At 2Am.,,,,,
,5337,Stayed In Room 2  The Curtains Could Do With A Dry Clean (Water Stained) The Headboard Of The Bed Could Do With A Clean (Also Stained) & There Was A Noise That Kept Occurring  Maybe A Generator Or Water Pipes... Woke Me Up A Couple Times! Other Than That The Bedroom & Bathroom Were Very Nice,,,,,
,5338,Very Comfortable Though The Design Was A Neither Totally Contemporary Nor Traditional.,,,,,
,5340,Just The Electrics Issue As Mentioned Before.  As There Was No Natural Light In The Bathroom It Did Mean We Were Getting Ready For Breakfast In The Dark.,,,,,
,5342,A Bit Too Warm  So We Opened The Window.,,,,,
,5344,The Rooms Could Use A Bit Of A Spruce Up As They Did Feel Used And Worn.,,,,,
,5350,The Bathroom Was A Little Tired And Could Do With Updating.  The Kettle Situation Was A Little Strange As There Was No Powerpoint Near Its Location So That You Could Use Easily  Nor Was There One Near The Table As A Result The Kettle Needed To Be Placed On The Floor To Use - Could Be A Health And Safety Issue.,,,,,
,5352,Should Offer Free Wifi. Also No Where To Put Used Tea Bags  If Put Them In The Bin  Would Leak Through And Stain The Carpet.,,,,,
,5353,We Upgraded To A Room With A Wonderful View Over The Valley. ,,,,,
,5354,Beautiful Decor And Great Views ,,,,,
,5356,No It Was Perfect,,,,,
,5358,No,,,,,
,5361,The Wind Was Very Strong But The Room Was Still Warm And Comfortable. ,,,,,
,5362,Extractor As Explained Before. ,,,,,
,5363,The Bed Was Very Comfortable.
It Would Have Been Useful To Have Had A Hand Rail When Bathing/Showering As The Bath Was A Little Slipery,,,,,
,5364,We Loved The Small Touches - Bottles Of Water  Biscuits  Fudge.  Bed Was Large And Super Comfortable.,,,,,
,5365,The Bedroom Was Not Very Spacious Considering The Price,,,,,
,5367,No Bubble Bath Provided! ,,,,,
,5371,No,,,,,
,5372,A Little Cold And The Separate Doors To The Bathroom Were A Little Frustrating. ,,,,,
,5373,Lovely. Very Well Decorated.,,,,,
,5375,Unbearably Hot. ,,,,,
,5376,Bed Very Comfortable   Pillows Very Soft   Lovely The Room Was Very Attractive But In Need Of Some Decoration But Certainly Very Clean And Cosy ,,,,,
,5377,A Little Small And Out Of Date ,,,,,
,5382,We Were Amazed How The Wind Didn't Come Into The Room With The Storm Outside. ,,,,,
,5383,It Was Very Nice Indeed Especially Given The Price For A 5* Hotel. 
The Only Improvement Suggestion Is That You Activate The Tv Sound Control - Ours Was Very Bassy And Dull And I Could Not Access The Tone Controls. ,,,,,
,5385,Gaps In Window Frame Made Room Cold  Stains On Bathroom Carpet  Ŵater Not Hot Enough,,,,,
,5386,No Trouser Press Or Luggage Stand. Bathroom Sink Had A Crack In It.,,,,,
,5387,Beautifully Decorated And Comfortable. (Kettle Flex Could Have Been Longer  Difficult To Plug In Without Moving Table) ,,,,,
,5388,Seemed A Little Tired.
,,,,,
,5389,As My Previous Note There Were Issues With Noise 29 ,,,,,
,5392,None,,,,,
,5394,Heating System Did Not Always Work. Duvet Too Heavy,,,,,
,5396,The Room Is Very Nice ( Room 19 ) However The Bathroom Needs Attention  Ceiling Is Peeling  Signs Of Damp Etc.
I Feel The Charge For Wi Fi In This Day And Age Is Unacceptable.,,,,,
,5397,Decoration Behind Reception Initially Looked Unfinished,,,,,
,5399,Nice Big Bathroom And Plenty Of Room To Relax In The Bedroom.  The Only Negative Comment I Would Make Is That The Lighting In The Bedroom Was Not Adequate For A Short Sighted Woman To Apply Her Make-Up!,,,,,
,5402,Rain Coming In Though The Windowsills And Left Puddles On The Sill.,,,,,
,5404,There Was Almost Constant Tapping From The Plumbing Which Was Distracting.  Bed And Room Were Good As Was Bathroom And Toiletries.,,,,,
,5405,Had To Relocate Kettle To Switch It On.,,,,,
,5406,The Outside Light Did Not Work  And Was Not Fixed During Our Stay. Although This Did Not Matter Too Much  It Did Mean That It Was Not As Easy To Unlock The Door Or Navigate Around The Cottage.,,,,,
,5407,Room Was A Bit Tired,,,,,
,5408,There Were Telephone And Internet Issues On 2 Of The 3 Days We Were With You In G3. Not An Issue Its Just We Did Not Plan On Having No Access And It Made Doing Small Bits Of Business More Difficult.

Lodges Were Superb Overall.,,,,,
,5410,Only To Repeat About Lack Of View. We Appeared To Be Next To The Kitchen Fan - Not Really Bothersome  But Nice When It Stopped.,,,,,
,5415,We Were Told Turn Down Would Be Approx. 6.30 And It Wasn't Until 7.30 By Which Time I Needed The Sofa Bed For My Children So I Did That Myself. Otherwise Room Was Perfect For Us.,,,,,
,5416,Previously We Have Had A Fridge With Fresh Milk But This Was Not Provided On This Occasion. Fresh Milk Was Provided Upon Request However. There Were No Welcome Biscuits In With The Tea And Coffee Box And These Were Also Provided When Requested. 
Also  Despite Turning The Radiator Off Completely  The Room Remained Very Warm Overnight And Sleeping Was Slightly Uncomfortable For My Partner. ,,,,,
,5417,Maybe Just Too Hot During The Night Even With The Windows Open.,,,,,
,5420,See Previous Comments - All There,,,,,
,5422,Wifi A Bit Hit And Miss Across The Hotel,,,,,
,5423,We Considered An Extra £40 Pd For School Holidays Was A Bit Excessive Especially As Our Room Could Not Have Accommodated More. ,,,,,
,5424,We Had A View Of A Roof And The Fans Above The Kitchen Were Really Noisy Until. 10.30 Pm,,,,,
,5425,I Spend My Hole Life Selling And Working With It Hard And Software So Part Of The Reason We Came To You Was To Get Ourselves Off The Uk Networks And As Such Did Not Use The Wifi Or Any Broadband During Our Stay. It Was Not Too Obvious That You Had Wifi But Then We Were Trying To Avoid It Anyway.,,,,,
,5426,Extremely Pleased With Room  Initially Found Tv A Bit Difficult To Get Working But No Problem Once We Had Worked It Out  Also Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Few Biscuits To Have With Our Tea/Coffee In Room,,,,,
,5429,The Style Of My Room Was Lovely However In The Bathroom There Were Lots Of Dampness Stains And Cracking Paint On The Walls And Ceiling. The Magnifying Mirror Was Nearly Hanging Off And The Wall Where It Had Been Secured Look Damaged. ,,,,,
,5430,There Was A Problem With The Bathroom Blind - When It Proved Difficult To Fix We Were Offered An Upgraded Room Immediately - Thank You  Nothing Appears To Be Too Much Trouble To Make The Stay A Wonderful Experience.,,,,,
,5433,Our Bedroom Was Amazing. The Only Disadvantage Was That There Was No Internet Connection And Mobile Phone Reception  It Just Kept Dropping Off - Not The End Of The World As We Came To Bovey To Experience What It Has To Offer  So Could Live 2 Days Without Mobile Phones.,,,,,
,5434,Beautiful Views And It Felt Like A Suite!,,,,,

,Not Answered:,0,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,
,2,Awards Lunch Food Was Excellent But Felt That The Dinner On The Night Prior Although Casual Did Not Reflect The Quality Of The Venue Overall. Also  At Breakfast I Felt That There Was Too Much Fat On The Bacon And That The Food Was Not Kept Hot Enough On The Buffet. I Asked For Brown Sauce (To Help With My Hangover!) Which Was Not On The Buffet And Someone Said That They Would Get It For Me But It Never Arrived.,,,,,
,3,The Food Was Great  Service Excellent But As There Were Very Few People Dinning It Lacked A Ambience/Buzz.,,,,,
,4,The Full English I.E. Bacon  Sausages  Hash Brown  Tomatoes Etc Should Be Freshly Cooked And Brought To Your Table Not For You To Have To Collect Buffet Style.  Staying Somewhere Like Bovey Castle You Do Not Expect To Have To Collect Your Cooked Breakfast.  It Is The Sort Of Thing You Would Expect To Do A Premier Inn Or Places To That Standard.,,,,,
,5,I Was Disapointed With The Selection Of The Menu And Felt That It Was Extremely Limited. Not What We Expected. Surprisingly Poor And Didn't Even Match The Type Of Selection You Would Expect From A Bistro Pub.,,,,,
,9,Beef Fillet Was Perfect! :) Plates Where Amazingly Decorated. Wine Was Good. Loved The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,11,Food Is Always Great When I Come To Bovey!,,,,,
,12,The Service Either In The Oak Room  The Restuarant And Room Service Was Far Too Slow. Room Service Was Very Poor  We Ordered Evening Drinks Every Day For Both Nights And Each Order Took 30-40 Mins To Come And We Had To Chanse At Least Once. The Oak Room Was Very Slow To The Point That It Was Annoying For Simply Drinks Or Sandwiches. The Edwardian Grill Was Too Slow For The Marquee Restaurant Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,13,The Food Was Lovely  - Well Prepared And Cooked.  The Service Was Excellent.  But The Menu Wasn't Special - Very Similar To Any Good Pub.  I Was Hoping For Something More Adventurous Or At Least More Exciting For Our Silver Wedding Anniversary.  Next Time We Would Upgrade To The Edwardian Dining Room.,,,,,
,15,Very Expensive When Compared To Inventiveness And Execution.,,,,,
,21,The Restaurant Manager Seemed A Bit Abrupt When Asked Simple Questions. Others In The Bistro Seemed More Concerned Than We Were So We Kept Quiet And Just Finished Our Food Before Returning To Our Room.  This Was The Only Negative Of Our Stay And Just Took The Edge Away From A Perfect Experience. All The Other Staff Were Lovely And Very Accommodating.,,,,,
,22,Excellent Food Great Wines And Service.,,,,,
,24,Food And Service Is Excellent. Well Done,,,,,
,25,Wasn't Keen On The Castle Bistro  It Looked And Felt A Little Scruffy And Not Up To The Standard Of The Rest Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,27,The Menu In The Bistro Is A Bit Limited And Never Changes And Is The Same For Both Lunch And Dinner. Daily And Separate Lunch And Dinner Menus Would Be Better.  We Loved Your Chef (Dark Hair & Beard) He Was Extremely Friendly And Gave Us Some Great Tips On Walks From The Castle And We Loved The Ring Of Bells!,,,,,
,29,The Atmosphere Of The Oak Bar Was Wonderful.  The Food In Both Venues Was Sublime  We Eat At Many Fine Dining Restaurants And Were Very Impressed With Everything.  The Different Styles Of The Venues Was Perfect  We Had A Relaxing Lunch In The Bistro And An Elegant Dinner In The Grill.  We Loved The Decor Throughout Especially The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,32,Compulsory Service Charge Bit Excessive Just For A Pub Type Lunch Or Sandwich In The Bistro,,,,,
,33,The Service In The Bistro Was A Little Slow And Inattentive  Not Nearly As Efficient As The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,34,We Would Like To Thank The Lady Who Talk To Us About The Local Sharpham Wine She Was Very Helpful And Informative.,,,,,
,36,Yes We Planned On Dressing Up For Dinner And Eating In The Restaurant Not Bistro But The Food Choice Was Poor And We Ended Up Going To A Local Restaurant Where The Food Was Excellent And More Of The Type Of Quality Dining We Had Expected From A 5* Hotel.  We Were Therefore Disappointed We Didn't Get The Opportunity To Dine In At The Hotel  Dress Up And One Of Us Not Have To Drive!,,,,,
,39,In The Edwardian Grill  The Waiting Staff Were Slow To Deliver Drinks To The Table And Had Taken One Of Our Drinks To The Wrong Table And Thereafter We Were Presented With Someone Else's Drinks..!,,,,,
,44,Staff Super. Friendly But Not Over The Top. Food Fab  Well Priced  Wine List Good   Good Experience All Round,,,,,
,45,Excellent Friendly Service  We Very Much Enjoyed Our Meal.,,,,,
,46,We Were Unable To Eat In The Bistro As There Was A Private Function There. We Only Wanted A Small Meal And So The Grill Did Not Appeal To Us. I Was Disappointed That We Had Not Been Informed Of This Earlier And That We Would Have To Eat From Low Tables In The Lounge.  However I Was Impressed That The Staff Were Able To Put Us At The Table In The Library Which Was A Lovely Experience. Had This Not Been Available I Am Unsure Whether I Would Have Such Kind Words To Say.,,,,,
,48,Thoroughly Enjoyed Both Meals In Each Of The Restaurants And The Service Was Excellent.  My Only Comment Was That In The Bistro My Husband And I Both Ordered The Prawn And Crayfish Salad.  Wehen Asked By The Waiter Once We Had Finnished If Everything Was Ok  I Replied Yes  And Just Made A Passing Comment That In Fact There Were No Prawns.  He Just Softly Laughed And That Was The End Of It.  To Be Honest It Did Not Really Matter  The Crayfish Were Lovely But Would Have Been Nice If Someone Had Told Us That You Were Out Of Prawns.  This Is Not A Complaint But Just Merely Mentioning It For The Purpose Of Your Questionnaire.,,,,,
,56,Service A Little Slow In Bistro And Would Be Good If Menu Changed More Often. Nice Ambience Tho And Good O Have Rhe Option For Kids. Food In Grill Was Good And Far Better Then In Most High End Hotels Although For Prices Charged  I Would Expect Food To Be Outstanding.,,,,,
,57,The Food Standards Were On The Whole Not As Good As On Previous Visits  Particularly Breakfast.,,,,,
,58,The Main Course Of Steak Was Not Up To The Standard That I Would Expect From A Fine Dining Restaurant.  This Was Dealt With By Amy At The Time.,,,,,
,59,Only One Down Point To Our Meal Were The Two Screaming Children Running Riot In The Restaurant. Maybe A Child Free Zone..?,,,,,
,61,Fantastic Service.,,,,,
,64,We Felt A Little Pestered By The Staff Offering To Fill Up Our Glasses A Little Too Frequently And Interrupting Our Conversation - But We Realise That This Is A Difficult Line For Staff To Judge  Overall We Felt Looked After And Valued,,,,,
,67,Loved The Private Rooms Provided For Our Party   Also Enjoyed The Piano Playing During Our Meal,,,,,
,68,There Were A Few Issues With The Edwardian For Breakfast.  One Morning No-One Came To Take Our A La Carte Order So We Went To The Buffet Instead.  A Drink Order Was Misunderstood Three Times. The Edwardian For The Evening: Food Was Excellent And Ambience Lovely.  Service Was Generally Very Good.  Felt That The High Standards Of Keeping Wine/Water Poured Instead Of By Us Did Slipped As The Restaurant Filled With Guests. Bistro For Dinner: I Personally Didn't Like The Television Being On In There But That Is Just My Personal Preference.  Food Was Very Good And Staff Very Good For The Ambience. Oak Bar: Atmosphere Very Relaxing And Staff Very Warm  Efficient And Friendly.  There Was A Mix Up One Day When We Had To Cancel Our High Tea Order Because We Had Clay Shooting To Go To And It Had Taken 45 Minutes Due To A Printer Error Between The Bar And Kitchen.,,,,,
,69,The Beef In Edwardian Grill Was Excellent. The Beef In The Sunday Lunch Was Brilliant  The Bistro Menu Was Disappointing,,,,,
,70,Nice Relax Family Dining Area,,,,,
,75,We Only Ate As Part Of A Group In Private Dining Room So Not Sure What It Would Be Like In Edwardian Grill Or Brasserie For Dinner.  Would Be Good If Menu In Grill Room Changed Daily.  Sirloin Main Course As Part Of Birthday Dinner Was Very Tough - We Had To Request Steak Knives As We Couldn't Cut It.  But Service Was Fantastic.  We Loved The Group Afternoon Tea Served At 1Pm / Lunchtime - Would Be Great To Offer It At This Time If Staying As A Normal Guest.  If You Have It After 3Pm You Are Too Full To Enjoy Dinner.,,,,,
,77,I Think You Could Improve The Service In The Castle Bistro And Make It More Slicker And More Efficient.  We Had To Ask For Lots Of Things That Really We Shouldnt Have To  Often Basic Things And The Staff Were Not As Professional As In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,78,Service Was Friendly But Slow.,,,,,
,79,The Breakfast Wasnt The Best  Enough Choice   But Hot Food On Cold Plates  No,,,,,
,81,We Just Had Room Service... We Tried To Order Late-Nite  As The Binder In The Room Said You Offered A Late-Nite Menu. But We Were Told It Was Actually Not Correct. The Night Porters Attempted To Put Something Together For Us  But It Was Really Not Good. Breakfast Also Came 1Hour After We Ordered It  The Toast Was Cold  And It Just Wasn't Brilliant.,,,,,
,85,Oak Bar Staff Disappointing. On One Evening  My Birthday  When Wishing To Order Some Champagne We Left After 10 Mins Having Been Given The Wine List But No One Taking Our Order.  Awareness Of Guests Was Lacking.,,,,,
,87,Adding Some Choices To The Bistro Might Be A Good Idea Although We Were Very Happy With The Food We Had,,,,,
,89,You Need A Complete Re-Think On Your Dining . Stop Trying To Be Something Your Not And Get Back To Good Basics. A Range Of Normal Sandwiches Presented Properly Would Be A Good Start. Small Fry's With Skins On. Utterly Daft.  They Just Look Overdone And Pretentious. This Is Not Fine Dining So Stop Trying To Impress. As For The Service Charge Every Time You Cough ?  Lets Not Go There. Wine Etc Was Good Selection And Normal Price So Ok There. But How About A Draft Beer To Complete That Picture?,,,,,
,92,Would Appreciate Some Lighter Options In The Bistro Menu. Limited Options For Light Bites.,,,,,
,94,Think The Dining And Lounge Area Dress Code  Needs To Be Upheld A Lot Of People In Jeans,,,,,
,96,Wider Selection Of Vegetarian,,,,,
,100,No,,,,,
,103,I Would Of Expected At Least A Drink To Be Served With Our Dinner Free Of Charge Considering The Cost To Stay Here.,,,,,
,104,We Really Enjoyed The Meal In The Edwardian Grill. The Dishes Were Delicious And Very Well Presented And The Staff Were Very Knowledgeable And Helpful.,,,,,
,106,The Ladies In The Bistro Were Friendly And Provided Excellent Service.  The Food In The Edwardian  Grill In Was Poor In The Morning  The Service Was Slow And We Didn't Receive Tea Or Coffee Until After Our We Had Finished Eating  The Staff Looked Miserable And Weren't Particularly Helpful.  The Evening Meal Was Slightly Better But Not Much.,,,,,
,107,None.,,,,,
,108,The Restaurant Was Badly Managed  The Staff Had No Leadership And All Appeared To Be Trying Not To Have To Take Any Responsibility. Our Order Was A Long Time Being Taken And An Even Longer Time Before It Was Served. Even Then The Steak Was Of Such Poor Quality It Was Uneatable. The Whole Experience Of The Restaurant Spoiled The Stay. The Hotel Is Excellent But The Standard Of Service In The Restaurant Lets It Down And The Quality And Imagination Of The Food Even More So.,,,,,
,110,We Felt That There Could Have Been More Choice Of Main Course On The Menu  E.G. There Was No Lamb Option.,,,,,
,111,Was Not Wildly Impressed With The Menue Or The Dinner & Thought The Wine List Very Exspensive. In Comparison With Say Gidleigh Or Other Similair Level Hotels Dinner Was Poor,,,,,
,112,Breakfast Options Were Not Well Explained Therefore Appeared To Be More Limited Than Is Probably The Case,,,,,
,118,Had Booked To Dine In The Bistro  However As We Would Have Been The Only Party In There  The Staff Set Us With A Table In The Library For A More Intimate Experience.,,,,,
,119,The Castle Bistro Staff Were Unorganised And Did Not Have Good Knowledge Of The Menu !,,,,,
,120,The Bistro Staff Need To Wake Up Twenty Minutes Pasted  I Had To Go And Ask For The Menus  They Then Forgot Our Dinks Order And Then I Had To Go Inside To Ask For The Bill After Nobody Appeared After 30 Minutes Of Finishing The Meal,,,,,
,121,We Did Find That The Service Was A Little Slow  Twice It Took Over 20 Mins Before Our Order Was Taken. This Was Both In The Main Restaurant And The Bistro.  We Were Also A Little Disappointed That It Was The Same Menu On Both The Saturday & Sunday Evening In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,122,The Food Was Excellent  But The Service Was Quite Slow & We Had To Ask For Our Water To Be Topped Up A Couple Of Times  But This Didn't Really Matter. Just Observation.,,,,,
,123,The Food Was Very Average.,,,,,
,124,L Had The Fish In The Castle Bistro Which Had To Much Oil Or Butter On It As Were The Vegtables L Did Struggle  With It . But My Husband Thoroughly Enjoyed His Pizza The Lady In Charge Of The Bistro Was Extremely Pleasent.,,,,,
,130,It's Soulless  Poor Service And Not Good Value.  The Bright Service Of Most Reception Staff Was Lacking In The Restaurant Staff.,,,,,
,131,We Had Sunday Lunch In The Edwardian Grill.  The Starters Were Very Good.  The Main Course Was Served With Under Cooked Vegetables.  They Were Hard And Were More Raw Than Cooked And Spoilt The Experience.  When We Asked For Them To Be Taken Away And Cooked  Al Dente Would Have Been Fine  They Were Changed For Some That Were Exactly The Same.  We Were Advised That The Head Chef Had Said That Was They Way They Should Be Served.  With All Due Respect To The Head Chef If A Customer Says He Would Like Something Cooked Differently Then That It What Should Be Done.  So All In All The Main Course Was Not As Good As It Could Have Been  Although The Beef Was Very Good.  Both Desserts Were Excellent.  The Restuarant Manager Offered Complimentary Coffees To Help Overcome Our Disappointment.    It Was Noticeable That The Lights In The Oak Bar Needed Cleaning As Dust And What Looked Like Dead Insects Could Be Seen Through The Shades.  A Small Detail But The Devil Is In The Detail.    The Staff Were Generally Very Pleasant  Helpful And Attentive.    ,,,,,
,132,Breakfast Service Could Have Been A Lot Better. We Had To Wait A Long Time For Service And Food To Arrive When Ordered From The Kitchen,,,,,
,133,Chips Were Not Good Only Two Sweets To Chose From,,,,,
,140,The Chips In The Bistro Were Very Soggy And Not Very Pleasant. The Eggs Were Hard And The Breakfast Was Cold - For The Eggs Benedict On The First Breakfast.,,,,,
,142,Very Impressed.,,,,,
,153,The Food Was Lovely But The Service In The Castle Bistro Was A Tad Slow - No Disrespect To The Staff Though As There Was Only Two Of Them Waitressing - The Girl Being Particularly Productive,,,,,
,157,We Had To Come And Look For A Waiter At Lunchtime To Place An Order :-(,,,,,
,160,As A Dining Venue Bovey Castle Came Highly Recommended.  However Our Experience Was Not To Be Highly Recommended. The Dining Rooms Were Decorated To A High Standard And Were Very Pleasing To Be In.  However  The Standard Of The Waiting Staff Throughout Was Less Than Satisfactory.  There Was Not A Happy Atmosphere  Staff Appeared Miserable And Grumpy  There Were Plenty Of Them On Duty So They Were Not Over Worked But A Smile Was Not Generally Forthcoming  We Were Seated Promptly But The Menus And Then The Food And Drinks Took A Long Time To Arrive.  The Male Waiting Staff Seemed 'Pompous' And 'Cocky' And Quite False.  Not Comfortable In Their Roles And The Whole Atmosphere Of The Place Took The Enjoyment Out Of Our Dining Experience.  What A Shame.  So Much Energy And Effort Has Gone Into The Quality Of The Decor And Getting That Right.  More Energy And Effort Needs To Go Into Recruiting The Right Waiting Staff To Compliment The Building.  Only 1 Girl In The Edwardian Grill And 1 Girl In The Castle Bistro Were Worthy Of Note And Made Us Feel As Though We Were Not A Nuisance.  Again  What A Shame.  ,,,,,
,162,Bistro Food Had A Tendency To Too Salty,,,,,
,163,The Menu Should Change From Day To Day If You Want To Encourage People To Dine More Regularly In The Edwardian.,,,,,
,164,Since The Dining Room Was Not Busy We Felt That All Diners Could Have Been Seated More Closely,,,,,
,165,The Table We Reserved Was Given To Someone Else.  Three Meals Were Very Good.  My Steak Was Overdone.  At Breakfast  Our Travelling Companions Had To Ask For The Used Dishes To Be Cleared.,,,,,
,168,Service And Food Preparation At Bit Slow At Times  Even When They Were Very Few Guests About,,,,,
,170,Excellent Service At The Grill And Bistro And I Would Commend The Waitress At The Bistro Who Volunteered To Take Our Order Early As We Needed To Feed Our 18 Month Old As Early As We Could On The Day We Left.,,,,,
,172,The Service Was Chaotic Albeit In A Friendly Way. The Pre-Dinner Bar Service Was Desperately Slow; Service In The Edwardian Grill Was Average With Too Many Different Staff Attending Our Table In An Unco-Ordinated Manner. Post Dinner Coffee And Liqueurs In The Lounge Were So Slow Arriving That One Of Our Party Gave Up Waiting And Retired For The Night And One Drink Ordered From The Menu Was Not Available. The Food In The Edwardian Grill Was Average (I Ordered A Fillet Steak Which Was Overcooked And Tough) And Overpriced.,,,,,
,173,Disappointed At The State Of Dress Of Some Guests When Dining In Such A Beautiful Restaurant  Guests Arrived In Jeans And Tshirts (This Was Men And Women). I Don't Think It Shows Respect For The High Standard Of The Venue,,,,,
,179,Breakfast Could Have Been Better With More Fresh Fruit  Selection Of Juice  Pastries Were Heavy And Burnt.,,,,,
,180,Your Survey Should Include 'Very Good' -- 'Excellent' Is Too Lofty And 'Good' Isn't Quite Lofty Enough. Your Wine List Was Overly Costly In Our Opinion.  (We Spend Most Of Our Time In Belgium And France And Find High Quality Wine Lists At Much More Affordable Prices  Even At 'Fine Dining' Establishments.) The Servers Should Come Around More Than Once With The Bread Basket. Your Castle Bistro Should Have A More Varied Menu And Include Some (Nice  Not Simple) Sandwiches.,,,,,
,181,The Service In The Bistro Was Very Poor And The Food In Both Venues Was Only Average And Not Up To 5 Star Quality.,,,,,
,182,The Main Dining Room Had Been Taken Over By A Large Party And We Were Therefore In A Smaller Room. It Was Fine But Perhaps Lacked The Atmosphere Of The Normal Larger Room. Also We Were Very Aware Of Two Guests Sitting On A Table Next To Us Whose Meal Was Very Delayed And They Were Clearly Not Happy!!!,,,,,
,185,Bistro Waiting Staff Friendly But Lacked Polish Expected Of Your Venue.,,,,,
,186,The Castle Bistro At Night Is Such A Contrast To The Rest Of The Property.   A Modern Approach Is A Really Good Idea But Unfortunately The Overall Impression Is Of A High-Street  Fast Food Outlet.    The Edwardian Grill Presents Well But A Far Greater Effort Could Be Made With The Presentation Of The Breakfast Buffet.   The Basic Commodities Of Your Red Meat And Fish Were Excellent.   However A Greater Choice  Perhaps To Include Chicken  Lamb Or Venison  Would Give A Better Variety.   After 3 Nights The Same Menu Begins To Paul With No Exciting Anticipation Of The Food To Come.,,,,,
,187,Due To The Low Light Levels In The Restaraunt Neither My Wife Or I Could Read The Menu And Eventually Had To Be Moved To A Table Were A Standard Lamp Could Be Plugged In. I Think This Caused Some Confusion As We Had To Wait Longer Than I Would Have Expected For Our Meals. However The Breakfast Was Excelent.,,,,,
,188,The Rump Steak Was Dreadful - Tough And No Flavour.,,,,,
,193,More Effort Could Be Made For Children's Meals Ie Smaller Portion Sizes And More Variety Eg Finger Sandwiches  Full Fat Yoghurts  Fresh Fruit.,,,,,
,195,The Buffet Style Breakfast On Sunday Was Disappointing Compared To The Excellent Individually Prepared Breakfast The Previous Day.,,,,,
,197,The Above Scores Applicable To The Edwardian Grill Which Was Exceptional. For Castle Bistro We Would Rate The Quality Of Food As 2  Service At 2 (It Was Busy & There Was Rather A Long Wait) And Overall Experience As 2.,,,,,
,198,2 Staff Asked For The Same Drinks Order  2 Staff Asked For The Dessert Order And The Dessert Choice Was Very Limited.,,,,,
,200,It Was A Shame That The Brasserie Was Not Open For Our Visit As We Would Have Eaten There On One Of The Evenings.,,,,,
,201,Always A Pleasure To Catch Up With Mr Rata!,,,,,
,205,The Edwardian Grill Was A Bit Quiet For The Two Nights That We Were There It Felt A Little Devoid Of Atmostphere?? Maybe Some Quiet Background Music Would Help?? The Food Was Excelent Although Not Totally To Our Taste Esp The Starters On The Evening Menu All Of The Staff Were Attentive Helpful And Knowledgeable. The Cheff Very Kindly Decorated My Partners Chocolate Desert With Happy Birthday Which We Were Both Very Touched By! The Full Breakfast Was Faultless And Good Value For Money With Lots Of Choice And Good Quality Ingreidents Again A Bit Quiet Tho? We Would Probably Have Eaten Our Evening Meal In The Bistro If It Hadnt Already Been Paid For But We Did Enjoy The Experience.,,,,,
,208,Would Try Edwardian Grill In Future,,,,,
,214,The Menu Was The Same On Both Evenings  Which Was A Bit Disappointing.,,,,,
,215,Good To Have The Relaxed Dining Option Of The Bistro,,,,,
,218,Excellent And Suprisingly Different Takes On Traditional Food,,,,,
,219,Your Staff Were Very Attentive The Only Annoying Thing Was We Left A Â£40 Tip  Then Later Noticed On My Bill There Was A Â£40 Service Charge,,,,,
,222,Although The Food Was Very Good  We Felt That There Was A Real Lack Of Choice Due To The New 'Nose To Tail' Menu That Has Now Been Introduced. The Menu Did Not Include Poultry  Game Or Lamb For The Main Course  So If You Did Not Like Beef  Or You Had To Avoid Beef Products Then There Were Very Few Options. We Felt This Was A Significant Weakness In What Had Previously Been An Outstanding Menu. We Talked Briefly To The Chef After The Meal  Who Explained The New Menu And Said That If Any Other Options Were Requested  Then They Could Be Catered For  But This Was Not Made Clear On The Menu Or By Staff.  ,,,,,
,227,There Were Only 5 Tables Dining So The Atmosphere Was Lacking  Candles On Each Table Was Lovely Touch.,,,,,
,232,We Have Dined In All Three Restaurants  Please See My Comments Re Bistro And Oak Bar Previously.Also I Think The Strawberry Preserve Served In The Oak Bar With Afternoon Tea Is Much Much Nicer Than The One Served In The Edwardian Grill With Breakfast.,,,,,
,235,Initially The Service Was Quite Slow  Over Half And Hour For Starter To Arrive Despite Order Being Taken In Bar. Once Starter Arrived All Excellent And Staff Very Attentive,,,,,
,239,We Were Surprised To Find That The Bistro Menu Did Not Change From Lunch To Dinner And The Specials Were The Same At Each Sitting. As We Ate There Twice Per Day Our Choices Seemed Limited.  The Menu In The Edwardian Grill Was Limited For Children Especially When One Of Ours Is A Vegetarian,,,,,
,241,Liked The Fact That Other Families Had Kids In The Posh Restaurant And Felt Comfortable To Have Them In There. Wonderfull Food,,,,,
,242,Beautiful Food And Very Friendly Staff  But Felt A Little Disorganized With Many Staff But Not Working Together Or To Their Best Abilities - All Very Friendly Though.,,,,,
,244,Liver From Menu Was Not Available After Being Ordered  Nor Vanilla Icecream To Go With Chocolate Brownie  Nor Brown Sauce To Go With Cooked Breakfast. Afternoon Tea Was Ordered In The Morning But When We Came To Have The Tea  The Order Had Not Been Written Down And Consequently Could Not Enjoy Our Chosen Venue.,,,,,
,245,Lovely,,,,,
,246,The Atmosphere At Breakfast Could Be Improved By Playing Music,,,,,
,255,Delicious Food  Beautifully Presented. The Waiting Staff Were Amazing...Thank You.,,,,,
,257,Breakfast Was Exceptionally Slow And The Food Was Average At Best.  We Would Expect A Much Higher Standard For This Hotel.  I Waited Over 20 Mins For Soya Milk Only To Ask Twice Again And Our Latte's Were Quite Possibly From An Automatic Dispenser.,,,,,
,259,The New Year Package Food Was Excellent - Plates Were Hot And Food Just The Right Portions And Exceedingly Tasty (Duck And Venison Were Wonderful Dishes And Loved The Flavour Of The Red Cabbage).  The Only Thing That Let The Restaurant Done Was The People In The Oak Bar - Are You Ready To Order Was Often Asked But 20 Minutes Later No One Returned.  We Just Went Straight To The Restaurant And Service Was Much Better.  For Dinner Service Special Mention Must Go To Rachel And Lucio Who Looked After Us With Great Style And Attention To Detail.  For Breakfast - Maybe A Few More Staff Would Have Helped As Cooked Breakfast Service Was Slow With Most Orders Being Chased After 15 Minutes To Receive An Apology And Resubmission.    On Arrival Though - Everything Was Very Hot And Tasty.,,,,,
,262,Bistro Is Consistently Delicious!,,,,,
,263,Sometimes You Are Left For Ages  With No Follow On Service..... I.E.: Between Main Meal And Dessert.  When You Are Attended To However  It Is Always Pleasant.  Its Just That You Can Get Forgotten.,,,,,
,264,Exceptional!,,,,,
,265,Very Relaxing In Wonderful Surroundings,,,,,
,266,Everything Was Delicious But Some Of The Food Was Over Seasoned (A Little Too Salty) For My Taste.  Still Very Scrummy But A Little Too Salty.,,,,,
,270,We Had To Ask For The Wine  It Was Not On The Table,,,,,
,273,No But Very Expensive!,,,,,
,274,The Lunch Was Excellent And The Dinner Was Good And Service For Both Was Excellent.  However The Breakfast Was Certainly Not 5 Star Quality.  The Cooked Breakfast Was Barley Warm  The Bacon And Sausage Were Unappetising  Pale And Anaemic  The Fresh Fruit Salad Was Awful   I Was Pleased When Warm Milk Was Bought For The Coffee As I Like My Coffee Hot But Unfortunately The Milk Was Warmer Than The Coffee.  Overall The Breakfast Was A Disappointing Experience And Far Short Of 5 Star Quality.,,,,,
,278,I Think The Bistro Would Benefit From A Wider Choice. The Food In The Restaurant Was Very Good.,,,,,
,279,Service In The Bistro Slow Which Meant I Had To Leave Lunch To Make Spa Appt On Time But They Did Deliver It To My Room Later,,,,,
,280,Also Ate In The Edwardian Grill Which Was Better Than The Bistro In All Areas But Still Not Up To The Standard I Would Expect For The Price.,,,,,
,281,Amazing Cheese Board,,,,,
,289,Afternoon Tea Was Delicious,,,,,
,294,Felt That The Edwardian Grill Was In Need Of A Re-Vamp  In Order To Produce A More Intimate And Cosy Dining Experience.,,,,,
,295,At Breakfast The Next Moring There Were Strong Winds. The Staff Managed The Repeated Power Cuts Very Efficiently And Calmly.,,,,,
,300,For Our Gala Dinner  Some Elements Were Not Ready On Time  For Example The Lighting Of The Candles. And Some Of The Staff Were Not As Helpful As Others In Getting All Elements Ready For Our Event On Time. We Were Late For Both Evenings Due To This.,,,,,
,301,It Is Good Having The Choice Of The Edwardian Grill And The Castle Bistro Especially When In A Family Group,,,,,
,303,One Waiter Serving Afternoon Tea Had A Poor Grasp Of English; Crumbs From Afternoon Tea Diners Were Left Uncleared. Most Staff Were Very Helpful  Willing And Efficient  And Some Were Charming And Pleasant Too. The Sommelier Was Very Knowledgeable And Friendly.,,,,,
,304,Unfortunately We'd Booked Looking Forward To Our Meal In The Edwardian Room  But It Was Being Used For A Function And We Were In A Room Off The Main Dining Room And Not Informed Until We Went Down To Dinner. We Were Called Through From The Bar  Approx. 3/4 Hr Before The Starters Arrived. When They Arrived  My Husbands Started Duck Egg And Asparagus  The Duck Egg Was Stone Cold So Had To Go Back To The Kitchen  And He Eat His Starter Alone  Some 15 Mins Later. All Of Us Ordered Beef Wellington  Admittedly I Order Medium To Well Done  But It Came Up Completely Overdone  And Quiet Tasteless.,,,,,
,306,No ' Small ' Bottles Of Water Available Only Large Ones.  No Service Regarding The Refilling Of Our Wine Glasses.,,,,,
,307,Service At Breakfast Was Very Slow  Both Mornings. On Saturday Breakfast I Asked For A Second Cappucino Coffee But After 15 Minutes Waiting I Gave Up And Left The Resturant  We Couldn't Get An Extra Round Of Toast Either  The Staff Didn't Seem To Know What To Do For The Guests.,,,,,
,308,Excellent Quality Food Imaginatively Presented And Friendly  Attentive  Professional Service. Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,309,I Like The Changes To The Main Restaurant  Still Well Presented Food And Helpful Staff Regarding The Wine Choices,,,,,
,310,We Stayed For Four Days And Had Planned To Dine In The Main Dining Room Each Evening. The Menu Was Somewhat Limited For That.,,,,,
,311,Service Was Lacking A Little Bit  Had To Ask For Things Twice Etc.. However The Food And Everything Else Completely Made Up For It. Also- Would Have Recommended Another Waitor Being In The Breakfast Room Constantly- Not Just To Show People To Tables Etc But To Help With Getting Tea And Coffee. Seemed A Bit Short Staffed- But Not Overly- Just A Little Observation.  Also- There Were Quite A Few Of Us Eating One Night In The Grill (I Think?)- Bovey Would Have Profitted From Someone Being There To Pour Drinks. Not Much Wine Was Drunk But If It Had Been Constantly Topped Up- I Know There Would Have Been A Lot More Drunk,,,,,
,315,Quite A Few Of Our Party Had Venison As Our Main Course And All Agreed It Was Over Cooked And Tough Which Was A Real Shame As The Starter And Dessert Were Excellent.,,,,,
,317,The Food In The Bistro Was Not Quite The Standard Of Our Previous Visit. The Oil And Balsamic Dip Had Too Much Oil And The Vegetarian Risotto Was A Little Stodgy ... My Childrens Meals Were Great And Overall It Was An Enjoyable Experience   The Ice Cream And Cheesecake Were Very Nice.,,,,,
,319,We Ordered Food From The Castle Bistro To Be Delivered To Our Lodge And Although Most Of The Food Was Very Good There Was An Exception When We Ordered Treacle Tarts For Four People And They Were So Hard They Were Virtually Inedible.  We Also Had Afternoon Tea In The Hotel And Thought The Scones Were Stale And Not Very Fresh.  We Realise That Perhaps We Should Have Mentioned This At The Time But Did Not Want To Make A Fuss About It Because Everything Else During Our Holiday Was Excellent.,,,,,
,320,We Had Food Delivered From The Bistro To Our Lodge On A Couple Of Occasions And Thought The Food Overall Was Very Good However We Ordered Treacle Tarts For Four People For Dessert One Evening And They Were Inedible.  Also Another Day We Had Afternoon Tea And The Scones Were Stale And Quite Hard - We Probably  Should Have Mentioned It At The Time But Did Not Want To Make A Fuss As Overall The Food Was Good.,,,,,
,323,Unusual Menu In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,324,Personal Preferance   Do Away With The Foam!,,,,,
,327,We Were Happy To Sit And Discuss Wine Choices With The Sommelier In An Informal Manor- This Was A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,332,We Could Not Have Cocktails As No One Knew How To Make Them As Cocktail Waiter Was Off ! I Ordered A Pre Dinner Drink Then Was Shown To Our Table... The Drink Did Not Arrive Until I Had To Ask Twice Then Came After Our Wine !,,,,,
,333,The Food Was Nice But Not Exceptional  The Starters Were Waiting Around And My Main Course Was Over Cooked  The Staff Were Very Good And The Service All Great But The Chef Who Was On View Looked A Bit Dis-Organised.,,,,,
,334,No Lager On Tap In The Oak Bar Is A Negative. Not Enough Bar Staff On Duty For The Number Of Guests - Everyone Was Waiting Too Long To Be Served,,,,,
,336,We Had To Ask For The Set Menu That Was Included In The Package We Had Paid For  And It Wasn't Explained Very Clearly What Had Been Included On The Dbb Basis - We Could Easily Have Ordered Off The A La Carte Menu And Had To Pay More Than We Were Expecting  If We Hadn't Bothered To Check. It Was The Only Niggle In A Fantastic Stay - The Charges For Extra Dinner And Breakfast Items Should Be Clearer  As They Were Far From Transparent  Almost As If You Were Trying To Get Us To Pay More Than We Had Intended (Which I'm Sure Isn't Really The Case  And Is Probably Down To Communication Failures).,,,,,
,340,Thought The Prices Were Slightly Steep  And Could Deter Some People From Dining Every Night With You. As Indeed We Did And Found Alternative Arrangements,,,,,
,343,Please See Previous Comment In Relation To Dinner Experience.,,,,,
,345,We Found The Edwardian Grill Excellent In Every Way  The Food  The Staff And The Ambience  The Bistro However We Found That The Food Wasn't As Good  The Chips Were Rock Hard. In-Edible In Fact And The Mussels Were Very Gritty And Our Table Wasn't Cleared After Our Main Course So After About 10 Mins We Just Got Up And Left,,,,,
,346,Excellent,,,,,
,347,Service In Castle Bistro On Saturday Was Excellent.  The Chef Was Brilliant With My Kids Showing Them How To Make Pizza.  On Sunday We Got Less Good Service  There Was A Big Family Table And The Waiting Staff Didn't Keep A Check We Were Ok And Needed Anything  We Had To Get Up And Approach Them Twice.,,,,,
,350,Lovely Atmosphere And Very Friendly Staff.,,,,,
,351,Slow Service And Had To Return Meal On The 2Nd Evening. Both Evenings The Dessert Had Run Out With Only Ice Cream  That Was Also Limited. Staff Were Friendly.,,,,,
,352,I Think The Emphasis On Beef Is A Mistake. I Don't Eat Beef Or Lamb ( I Produce Both So Too Close To Home!) The Tasting Menu Is There For Out....And I Felt A Little Limited For Choice For The Main Menu.,,,,,
,355,We Had Planned To Eat In The Edwardian Grill But Found The Menu Off- Putting ( One Of Our Party Can Only Eat Small Quantities And Was Put Off By Prices And The Starters And Menu Generally Were Not Very Teenager Friendly). A Fixed Price Menu At Around Â£25 For 2 Courses Would Make The Grill More Attractive. I Overheard Others Discussing Going Out To Neighbouring Pubs To Eat Which I Suspect Reflects Sense That The Grill Is Just Not Affordable. We Had A Very Enjoyable Meal In The Bistro But You Obviously Don't Get Quite The Same Experience,,,,,
,356,Considering The High Standard Of The Food/Menu The Experience Would Have Been Even Better If This High Standard Had Been Maintained By Serving Canapes With Pre-Dinner Drinks In The Oak Bar Instead Of The Bread Sticks  Jar Of Olives And Nuts.,,,,,
,358,The Dining Room Was Quiet So Lacked Atmosphere,,,,,
,359,Very Nice Relaxed Meal But One Waiter Couldnt Understand What We Wanted And Told The Table Behind Us Lamb Was In The Game Stew When Asked By The Couple So They Had To Ask Another Waiter.,,,,,
,361,The Bar Menu Is Limited And The Presentation Of The Sandwiches Was Uninspiring.,,,,,
,362,The Breakfast Was Very Good  But I Requested Decaff Coffee And Was Brought One Cup Which Was Ok But I Would Have Expected To Have Been Offered A Top Up.  After We Had Checked Out Been For A Walk We Had Coffee And Biscuits In The Lounge Again We Were Not Offered A Refill.,,,,,
,367,We Had A Meal In The Bistro Which Was Of A Good Standard And The Waiter Was Very Attentive.  There Appeared To Be Problems With The Card Terminal As It Took Around 5 Minutes To Process The Bill  With The Waiter Having To Take Away My Card With The Terminal For Some Of This Time.  It Transpired That This Was A Common Problem.,,,,,
,369,We Booked Our Dinner For 9Pm But Due To The Busy Restaurant Did Not Get Our Main Course Til After 10.30. It Was Then Too Late For Me To Even Finish My Meal And I Felt It Didn't Offer Value For Money Which Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,371,Whilst The Food Was Very Good And Plentiful  The Staff Could Not Speak A Word Of English And We Held Back On A Couple Of Requests Because It Was More Trouble Than It Was Worth. I Had To Mime What 'Salt' Was  And After That It Just Went Downhill Further. I Know They Have To Learn On The Job  But I Don't Think People With Such A Poor Command Of The Language Should Be Allowed 'Front Of House' So Early On In A Reputable Establishment.,,,,,
,372,Castle Bistro Was Slow - Grill Was Excellent,,,,,
,374,We Were Particularly Impressed With The Sommelier Who Was Very Helpful When We Dined At The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,375,The Portions Have Reduced In Size Since We Were Last There!,,,,,
,377,The Bistro Can Feel Rather Uninviting And Stark Compared To The Rest Of The Comfortable Surroundings - It Would Be Nice To Have The Option To Maybe Enjoy The Bistro Menu But Take Your Meal In An Other Area?,,,,,
,378,We Was Promised A Lovely Table But Was Put Near The Door  We Was Given Menu's 3 Times  There Was Clearly An Atmosphere Between The New Restaurant Manager And Staff Which Was Not Pleasing To See  Our Drinks Were Ordered But Forgotten,,,,,
,379,The Staff Were Lovely But The Service Was Very Hit And Miss - Some Things Didn't Arrive At All  Some Took A Lot Longer  But We Weren't In A Hurry So It Didnt Really Matter Too Much To Us.,,,,,
,381,Staff Could Do With A Little More Training. Did Not Realise We Had To Book In Advance For Afternoon Tea,,,,,
,383,The Food At The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent However The Food At The Castle Bistro Was Average At The Most.,,,,,
,385,It's So Lovely To Eat Somewhere With High Quality Food And Excellent Service That Still Manages To Be Family Friendly!,,,,,
,386,Food Was Presented Well But Wasn't As Good As We Would Of Expected For The Price.,,,,,
,387,The Service Was Appalling. We Waited 25 Mn To Get Menus. We Got Up And Got Them Ourselves. We Had To Ask For The Bread Several Times. Even Though We Ordered For The Children Before The Adults Their Food Came After Our Starters! The Youngest Who Is 4 Was Always Served 10Mn After Everyone Else Even For His Ice Cream... None Of Our Requests Were Taken Seriously By The Staff . Apart From Maxime The Servers Were Idle Most Of The Time And Unhelpful. When We Requested Menus  Bread  Champagne Or Anything Else We Had To Ask Several Times And Had To Get The Manager To Take Our Order.,,,,,
,389,We Dined In The Brasserie Part  Which After The Rest Of The Venue Seemed A Little Lower Grade - Mainly Because The Bar Is Set So High Elsewhere!,,,,,
,390,We Ordered Drinks At 19.00 From Room Service To Enjoy While We Got Ready For Dinner And By 19.30 They Had Not Arrived So We Phoned Again. We Were Still Waiting At 19.45 So We Cancelled Our Drinks Order. This Was Very Disappointing!,,,,,
,395,Castle Bistro Service And Food Quality Was Not Good Enough For Us To Eat In There More Than Once.  It's Not Really Up To The Standard Of The Rest Of The Hotel.  Our Second Night In The Grill Was Very Good And The Service And Food Quality Were An Appropriate Standard.  Afternoon Tea Lived Up To Its Reputation.,,,,,
,396,The Staff In The Bistro Were Extremely Friendly And Helpful Both Nights (And One Lunchtime) We Dined There.  The Food Was Delicious And Beautifully Present.  We All Give It A Really Big Thumbs Up!,,,,,
,397,Food In Bistro Was Excellent However The Service Let The Overall Experience Down. Having To Ask For Cutlery  Napkins  High Chairs Was Annoying  More So As It Was After The Meal Arrived. Haphazard Would Discribe The Experience. Any Atmosphere In The Bistro Was Non Existant  It May Be The Stacked Chairs  Dark Corners  Or The General Lay Out  However Again The Food Was Fantastic,,,,,
,400,The Bistro Was Very Disappointing.  The Food Was Not Good / What We Would Have Expected.  The Service Was Not Good Either.  We Ended Up Avoiding The Bistro And Didn't Have Enough Confidence To Dine In The Edwardian Room So Cancelled Those Reservations And Went To A Local Pub.   The Lounge Menu Was Uninspiring.,,,,,
,401,During Both Breakfast's The Service Could Have Been More Attentive (Plates Took A Long Time To Be Cleared  Cruets And Buttter Missing).  Coffee Served At The Wedding Reception Was Not Very Hot.,,,,,
,403,Oak Bar Lunch And Castle Bistro Were Great  But I Thought That The Food In The Edwardian Grill Was Good But Not Inspiring. The Bistro Was Good Value For Money  The Edwardian Grill Wasn't.,,,,,
,404,On Previous Occasions A Pianist Played Outside The Edwardian Grill And This Gave A Lovely Accompaniment To The Meal.  I Had Hoped That It Would Be The Same At Sunday Lunch.  But That Is Just A Small Comment.  The Overall Experience Was Very Good. Thank You.,,,,,
,405,We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Cream Tea - Delicious. The Food Served In The Edwardian Grill Was A Little Unusual For Our Preferred Taste,,,,,
,406,Please See Previous Comments Regarding The Bistro - It Really Lets The Hotel Down And Had This Been Our Only Experience Of Dining At The Hotel My Rating Above For Food And Experience Would Have Been Very Poor.,,,,,
,408,In The Past I Have Used Edwardian And The Service There Is Top Rate. I Have Used The Bistro This And Last Visit And Generally The Service Is Not Up To The Standard It Needs To Be - Always Seems To Be 1 Staff Member Below What Is Needed. The Staff Were Absolutely Fine  Just Not The Time To Service Us As Needed  Not Terrible Service But A Bit On The Slow Side And The Appearance Of Not Being Attentive Due To Time Pressure's.,,,,,
,409,Edwardian Grill Would Benefit A Tasteful Redecoration And New Lighting In The Grand Style Of The Hotel,,,,,
,414,The Service In The Bistro Was Extremely Slow And The Quality Of The Sandwiches For Lunch On The Terrace Was Very Ordinary. The Edwardian Grill  However  Was Very Good But We Were There All Week So It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Change Of Menu Or At Least A Special.,,,,,
,415,Full Afternoon Tea Was Excellent In The Big Hall - Oak Room ? Dinner In Bistro Was Poor And Poor Value. These Type Of Casual Dining Options Never Seem To Work In All The Upmarket Hotels I Have Been To. Room Service Is Usually A Simpler And Better Bet. As It Was Here .,,,,,
,416,Need To Change Water In Flower Vases More Regularly. Chef Needs To Time Eggs Better!,,,,,
,417,Service For The Children Was Occasionally A Little Slow,,,,,
,418,Dinner In Th Edwardian -Excellent Bistro Lacking In Choice And Really Should Have Many Of The Options That Are On Thre Room Service Menu As Was Lacking For Quick Snack /Lighter Lunch After Golf. Perusla Of Room Service Had Good Selection Aof Thing S That Shud Have Been Available Eg Club Sandwich Also Service Was Was Slow As Was Undersatffed - The Bistro Seenmde To Have An Identity Crisis In That Didnt Know Whether It Was A Formal Restaurant Or Informal Cafe/Bar - It Should Be The Latter,,,,,
,419,Although The Food And Service In The 'Main Restaurant' Was Good. We Went To The Bistro On Our First Night Which Was Less Good.  Food Was Average (Appreciate That This Also Caters For Children) And Although The Staff Were Helpful They Could Probably Do With Some 'Guidance' From Those Working In The Main Restaurant.  Would Have Thought This Would Have Been Much Closer To The Restaurant In Terms Of Menu And Quality Of Offering,,,,,
,420,Bistro Food Quality  Atmosphere And Service Mediocre (Terrible Rib Eye Steak) Edwardian Food Quality And Service Good  Although Rather Empty  With Restricted Menu. Not Everyone Wants To Eat Beef And Certainly Not Every Night! Breakfast Good - Nicely Presented - Could Have More Varied Cold Choices,,,,,
,422,Very Friendly Staff,,,,,
,423,Not Sure That The 'Non Resident' Is Welcome  For Dinner/Luncheon/Afternoon Tea  Even Having Visited The Castle As A Guest,,,,,
,424,We Had A Pizza Which Reminded Us Of The Way They Are Presented In Italy - Praise Indeed. They Were Delicious  Please Don't Change The Way They Are Cooked Or Presented.,,,,,
,428,The Bistro Experience Was Absolutely Dreadful&Gt; From The Inexperienced Staff  The Lack Of Staff  The Painfully Slowness Of The Chef ( 4O Mins For Our Main Courses?) The Very Casualness Of The One Member Of Staff (Who Appeared To Be The One In Charge ) Was Unacceptably Familiar (More Like A Waitress In Macdonalds)  The Rotten Food (My Husband And I Were Shocked That After Having Eaten Some Of His Steak Burger  He Found It To Be Red  Raw And Uncooked In The Middle! The Portion Sizes Were Miserable. The Prices Charged Were Stupidly High For What Was Offered. One Big Shake Up Is Needed Here In This Bistro!! And The Chef Didn't Even Come Out To Apologise Or Give Anything Off The Bill (Which Was Over 100),,,,,
,431,Waited Three Quarter Or Am Hour For A Drink,,,,,
,434,The Timing For Dining Was Handled Poorly - We Were Told By Reception On Both Evenings That We Could Only Dine At Very Restricted Times. In Actual Fact The Edwardian Grill Restaurant Was Quiet And We Could Have Dined At Our Leisure.,,,,,
,436,At Breakfast On Two Occasions Staf Were A Little Slow Replenishing The Breakfast Buffet Table,,,,,
,437,Just Outstanding. First Class Compliments To Sultan For Taking Personal Care Of Us For The Whole Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,439,I Asked For A Medium Fillet Steak Which Was Rather Overdone And Charred On The Outside. But Apart From That The Food Was Lovely.,,,,,
,440,The Restaurant Manager (Romanian?) Was Truely Excellent,,,,,
,442,The Restaurant Was Beautiful. Tableware Excellent. The Most Splendid Location For A Wedding. Unfortunately We Did Not Eat In The Castle Bistro On Our First Night As We Had Arranged To Meet Family For Dinner In North Bovey. All Of The People Who Stayed Who Ate In The Bistro Enjoyed Their Meal There. Compliments From Various Guests Regarding The Wedding Breakfast. One Point To Note A Few People With Children Would Have Liked Them To Have Received Their Main Course At The Same Time As The Adult First Course Because Of The Quite Long Gap Between Courses. Breakfast Was Very Good.,,,,,
,443,The Plates  On Which Hot Food Were Served  Were Generally Warm&Gt;Hot  But Not Universally So  And Certainly Not So At Breakfast Service. Fresh Grapefruit Seemed Absent At Breakfast  As Did Grapefruit Juice. (Thanks To The Manager Who Remedied This On Our Departure Day).,,,,,
,445,We Had Lunch In The Bistro And Had Hoped To Eat In The Bistro In The Evening As We Preferred The Bistro Menu. Unfortunately The Wedding Party Needed The Bistro So We Dined In The Evening In The Mulberry Room.We Were Well Looked After And For Most Of Dinner Had The Room To Ourselves. It May Have Helped If The Bistro Menu Was Available In The Edwardian Restaurant.,,,,,
,449,I Pre-Booked Dinner Reservations And Was Given 19.45  Rather Than The 20.00 Requested.  This Seems A Little Pedantic As The Table Wasn't 'Re-Used' As Far As I Could Determine.  We Ate The 4 Nights And Of The Dinner Menu I Can Say We Were Only Disappointed With One Main Course  This Was On The Easter Monday When The Dining Room Was Very Quite So This May Have Been A Contributing Factor.,,,,,
,454,The Experience In The Bistro Was Good All Round  But The Edwardian Grill Was Extremely Disappoining. The Quality Of The Food Was Poor ( In Particular The Beef )  The Portions Were Unimpressive And Expensive.  The Wine We Chose Was Not Available And The Offered Replacement Was The Same As That Served In The Bistro But At Â£ 6 More !  Sorry But The Service Was Slow And Not Up To Expectations,,,,,
,455,The Staff Were Very Flexible And Accommodating. The Castle Bistro Is An Excellent Venue With A Lovely Relaxed Atmosphere And Very Pleasant Surroundings.,,,,,
,456,Unfortunately  The Chair My Wife Was Sitting On At Breakfast Collapsed. She Was Shocked But Not Seriously Hurt.,,,,,
,460,Breakfast Service Was Very Slow On Two Days. Seemed Unable To Cope With Cooking,,,,,
,463,On Two Visits To The Edwardian Dining Room We Received Unclean Cutlery Which Was Duly Changed.We Ordered Coffee And Petit Fours To Be Served After The Dessert But They Were Brought To Our Table Once Before The Dessert Was Served And Again Before We Had Finished The Dessert.,,,,,
,465,I Found The Children's Meals Very Salty And They Were Very Thirsty After Their Meal. The Chips Seemed To Be Heavily Pre-Salted And The Sausages Were Also High In Salt. They Also Didn't Seem To Be Very Good Quality Meat.,,,,,
,467,Food Was The Best Part Of The Whole Experience. Castle Bistro Was Our Favourite- The Edwardian Grill Lacks Atmosphere But The Food Was Beautiful All Round.,,,,,
,469,On Our Day Of Arrival We Eat At 'The Bistro' I Had The Gammon  Chips And A Fried Egg. The Gammon I Found Tough And Overdone  Chips Were Burnt And The Yolk Of The Egg Wasn't Runny. I Was Disappointed With This Course  It Was Not A Meal I Would Expect From A 5 Star Restaurant. I Did Complain To A Member Of Staff.,,,,,
,472,The Private Dinning Was Amazing ... I Was Particularly Impressed That Following Our Pre Order You Had Created Place Names With Our Choices - A Brilliant Touch!,,,,,
,476,Very Good Food And Service Was Good. The Menu Is A Little Limited But Was Fine For A Weekend.,,,,,
,478,I Think Vegetables Could Have Been Provided With Our Main Course (Beyond The Spinach  Which The Beef Was Served On).,,,,,
,481,The Bistro Doesnt Quite Know What It Wants To Be. Call It A Cafe Or Pizzeria And You Know What To Expect. A Bistro Sets A Different Expectation Which It Did Not Live Up To.,,,,,
,484,The Food In The Edwardian Grill Was Delicious And Beautifully Presented. The Staff Were A Little Slow To Bring Over Our Drinks Orders Which Wasn't Ideal As We Had A Young Child Asking For Hers! The Food In The Bistro Tasted Great. However  I Got A Nasty Bout Of Food Poisoning After Eating The Mussels In The Bistro On My Second Night And Was Very Ill. I Reported This To The Reception The Next Morning  But Heard Nothing Further When I Was Checking Out. It's A Shame As It Put A Dampener On What Would Otherwise Have Been A Very Enjoyable Dining Experience.,,,,,
,485,The Edwardian Grill And Castel Bistro Were Amazing However We Also Booked In For Afternoon Tea Which Though The Food Was Lovely  The Service Was Awful. We Had To Go In Search Of Someone So We Could Get Our Tea And Noone Asked Us If Everything Was Ok Or If We Needed Anymore Tea Or Any Extras So Having To Pay The Service Charge Was Not Worth It.,,,,,
,486,We Very Much Enjoyed The Bistro But Found The Steak In The Grill To Be Rather Dry And Not Very Tender. Breakfast Was Great But Rather Slow When Ordering Off The Menu. There Are A Great Number Of Exposed Leads And Wires Under The Table With The Till On Top Which Lets Down Such A Grand Looking Room.,,,,,
,488,I Was Unable To Dine In The Restraint As You Were Hosting A Group.  This Was Extremely Disappointing.  I Was Offered A Very Dark  Small Additional Room That I Could Dine In.  However  The Group Were Obviously Your Priority And The Staff Were Continually Tied Up With The Group.  As Such  I Gave Up And Went And Had Dinner In The Bistro.,,,,,
,489,Outrageously Expensive For Our Experience. Staff Didn't Know Wine List Eg Didn't Know If You Had Pinot Grigio And Were Ride To My Guest Regarding Ognac,,,,,
,491,The Food Was Immaculate  The Sommelier Was Fantastic  However The Serving Staff Lacked Experience/Finesse. For Example; Bread Was Served Going Across The Table  When Asked During The Tea What Was Served The Waiter Was Not Able To Convey The Menu And We Had To Pour Our Own Wine Once During Dinner.,,,,,
,495,Service Was Very Slow In The Bistro Restaurant But It Was Very Busy.  A Number Of Staff Apologised About The Delay.,,,,,
,496,The Service At Breakfast Was Extremely Slow And The Quality Of The Sausages Were Disappointing!,,,,,
,498,The Food Whilst Fine Did Not Really Live Up To The Surroundings  I Didn't Leave With The Wow Factor On The Food That I Was Perhaps Expecting,,,,,
,500,While Having Afternoon Tea On Two Occasions  We Had To Remind Staff Of Order And / Or Forgotten Drinks.,,,,,
,502,Dinner At The Edwardian Grill Sat Evening Was Sensational. Excellent Meal And Service. Felt Very Special.  Castle Bistro On Friday Night Was Poor. Had The Risotto Which Was Overcooked And Service Was Very Patchy - One Excellent Server But We Didnt Start With Him And Had To Wait A Long Time.  Felt That Breakfasts Could Have Been Better - Service Was Slow.  Sunday Lunch Excellent But Again A Lot Of Waiting For Service,,,,,
,505,The Bistro Was Nice And We Had A Very Enjoyable Meal  But It Was A Touch Too Expensive.,,,,,
,506,I Thought That The Menu In The Bistro Lacked Imagination  And When We Ordered Shortly After 7.30Pm There Were Quite A Few Things That Were Unavailable.  The Portion Of Risotto Was Too Large.  It Was Unfortunate That Where I Sat I Had To Sit Watching The Rather Off-Putting Eating Habits Of Two Small Children.  It Would Be Nice If Perhaps There Was A Separate Area Of The Restaurant For People Dining With No Children.,,,,,
,507,Had To Send The Fish Cakes Back As They Were In Edible Due To Strong Salty Taste. Service Was Very Slow.,,,,,
,509,The Choice In The Bistro Was Very Limited And Inflexible! There Was Little Choice For Vegetarians. Overall The Gulf Between The Bistro And Grill Is Significant  And Whilst The Bistro Is A Good Lunch Option It's Not For Dinner.  Staff Were Inconsistent With Regards To Efficiency And Friendliness,,,,,
,515,Unfortunately You Got The Steaks The Wrong Way Around And Therefore Not Only Did We Get The Wrong Cut They Were Also Over And Undercooked Respectively. We Were Also Given The Wrong Bill. We Did Highlight The Steak Issue At The End Of The Course - We Couldn't Get The Staffs Attention During The Food. The Steaks Were Very Good But For 5 Stars You Expect Better Or At Least Some Sort Of Gesture To Make It Up.,,,,,
,516,Afternoon Tea Was The Best In Terms Of Food Quality That I've Ever Had (Vs The Ritz  The Dorchester!!),,,,,
,517,Wonderful Food But Very Expensive!,,,,,
,520,The Service Was Not As Good As I Would Expect. We Had A Long Wait For Ordered Drinks And Had To Ask For These Again On Two Occasions.   The Very Efficient Lady That Showed Us Around Said There Would Be Complimentary Canapã©S Which We Never Received Either.,,,,,
,521,The Service In The Restaurant Was Very Good  The Service In The Bar Was Not As Good Unfortunately. One Of The Bat Staff Spilled A Lot Of Champagne We'd Bought When Pouring And Didn't Offer To Refund  This  Also There Was A Staff Dispute Which I'd Rather Not Listen To On My Weekend Off. Overall Staff Standard Noticeably Dropped From Previous Visits.,,,,,
,529,Service For Drinks Was Very Slow.,,,,,
,530,The Food Was Excellent. Wedding Breakfast Was Superb. Fudge On Bed Was A Nice Touch Too.,,,,,
,534,Breakfast Was A Little Unorganised As We Were Offered Meals On Several Occasions After Finishing Our Breakfast.,,,,,
,538,Service During Breakfast Wasn't As Efficient - It Took A Long Time Before Anyone Asked If I'd Like Coffee/Tea Or Toast. Attention To Detail Such As Noticing The Lack Of Cutlery And Cups On The Table Could Have Been Better.,,,,,
,541,The Food Was Absolutely Delicious  Especially The Beef Which Was Cooked To Perfection And Delivered On Flavour Spectacularly. Thanks To The Chefs!,,,,,
,544,The Food At The Edwardian Grill Was Outstanding. I Think Your Service Staff Could Have Been More Friendly.  Castle Bistro Service Was Slow  But The Food Was Good.,,,,,
,545,Our Evening Was Slightly Marred By A Family With Very Noisy Children Right Next To Our Table. Not The Fault Of The Hotel Although I Wonder If It Would Be Possible To Segregate Adults And Children So That A Group Of Adults Could Enjoy An 'Adult Only' Zone?,,,,,
,549,See Previous Comment On Castle Bistro.  Our Experience In Castle Bistro Was Very Poor Indeed And We Shall Not Be Returning There.  The Staff Were Generally Rude  Too Busy To Serve Us  Did Not Know The Menus  Unhelpful  Needed To Be Asked To Be Served Rather Than Waited Upon.  Breakfast In The Edwardian Grill Was Ok  But Again Staff Were Generally Running Around  Very Busy With Little Time To Serve Us.  We Had To Ask More Than Once For Things.,,,,,
,553,The Staff In The Bistro Seemed Very Disorganised And Not Very Attentive.  Each Visit To Our Table Seemed To Be A Different Person And A Couple Of Times We Had To Go And Find A Member Of Staff To Order Drinks,,,,,
,554,Breakfast Was Adequate Only,,,,,
,555,Afternoon Tea Was A Delight  Particularly After We Could Move Away From Some Other Guests  The Evening Meal Food Wise Was Slightly Less Of A Standard Than We Had Been Expecting From The Menu ... I Had Fish And Chips  And Found The Former Was Lovely  But The Rest Of The Dish Was A Deep Disappointment  And Slightly Chilly  Which Was Surprising Given The Under Half Capacity.,,,,,
,558,Nne,,,,,
,559,When I Made The Booking I Was Asked If I Would Like To Reserve A Table In One Of The Restaurants.  Unfortunately As We Were Due To Attend A Family Party  I Was Unaware Of Timings. When We Arrived We Were Unable To Book Into The Edwardian Restaurant Although Booked In The Bistro. My Food Was Ok  Mushrooms On Tost Folloed By Pizza. First Time I Have Eaten Mushrooms On Toast Or Pizza In A 5 Star Hotel! I Thought Prices Were Reasonable. My Partner Did Not Enjoy His Food At All. He Had Salmon Followed By Fish And Chips  He Said That The Salmon Was Ok But His Main Was Oily And Tge Chips Were So Crispy That They Cut His Gum. Overall Not A Great Meal For Him.,,,,,
,561,We Had To Get 50% Off Of The Food Bill As We Had To Wait 3Hrs To Be Served - Although Half Of Our Table Were Served An Hour Previous To Us. My Grandfather Had To Go To Bed Without Eating As It Had Become Too Late For Him To Eat By 10 - We We Had Sat Down At 7. The Bill Even With 50% Off Still Came To Â£50 A Couple Which Was Shocking!,,,,,
,565,Breakfast Service Wasn't Good  We Were Asked To Sit On A Table Laid For 8 When There Were 4 Of Us  You Don't Expect This In A 5 Star Hotel. A Table Four 4 Guests Should Have Already Been Laid.,,,,,
,566,We Ordered Room Service From The Edwardian Grill  Which Disappointingly Took An Hour To Arrive. The Steak Was Not Cooked As Requested And I Was Unable To Finish My Meal. The Other Main Was Fine.,,,,,
,585,Bistro Kitchen Should Be Cleaner. The Choice At The Edwardian Restaurant Was Very Limited.,,,,,
,592,The Service Was Normally Of A High Standard Apart From Our Last Night But The Manager Was Aware Of This And Apologised  Which We Welcomed.,,,,,
,593,Bistro Food And Service Was Excellent. Edwardian Restaurant Food Was Excellent  But Service Was Very Poor - My Wife And I Waited Literally 25 Minutes Before Our Drinks Order Or Starter Order Was Taken  Then Waited A Long Time For Main Course  Where Our Side Order Of Vegetables Were Not Served  We Then Were Forgotten About For A Dessert Order. Neighbouring Tables Seemed To Take Preference. A Great Shame !,,,,,
,594,I Was Surprised By How Good The Food Was: I Had Been Expecting More Old Fashioned Fare  And Found The A La Carte Meals To Be Well Presented And Quite Modern.  Staff Were Wonderful: They Could Not Have Been More Accommodating Or Professional.  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,595,Service In Bistro Was A Bit Slow And Disorganized,,,,,
,596,Bistro Very Good. Grill Was Not As Good As Expected Mainly Due To Waiter Staff,,,,,
,597,Our Evening Meal Was Not Good And We Were Not Charged. The Following Days Lunch Was Lovely.The Chef Was Very Accommodating And Friendly And Our Order Was Wrong On Both Occasions But We Felt This Was Due To The Waiter Rather Than The Kitchen.,,,,,
,599,When We Had Our First Lunch It Took A Good 15Minutes For Anyone To Ask Us If We Wanted A Drink And Then Our Pizza Order Was In Correct So They Had To Make It Again. This Is Not So Much A Complaint As The Waitress Offered Us Some Free Chips And She Was Amazing And Friendly Just Really An Observation,,,,,
,600,Bistro Steak Was Truly Excellent,,,,,
,601,Normally Very Good Though We Had One Evening Meal Where Both Main Courses Were Very Salty  The Staff Dealt With It Well So No Further,,,,,
,603,At The Time We Did Mention It To The Manager On Duty  But We Were Called In Very Late To Our Table And Had To Wait A Long Time For Our Food  By Which Time  Most Of Us Were Too Tired To Eat.,,,,,
,606,I Was Part Of The Peugeot Group. We Were Impressed With The Way The Kitchen Staff / Chefs Were Able To Get The Food Out For A Wedding And Then Us Without Stopping. It Must Have Been A Long Hard Day For Them With Two Sittings Non Stop! Please Pass On My Compliments To All The Kitchen Staff Who Worked On Saturday 28Th.,,,,,
,608,We Had Dinner In The Edwardian Grill.  Both My Husband And I Had The Red Mullet  Which Was So Overcooked That It Was Inedible. We Mentioned This To The Waiter Who Said He Would Speak To The Kitchen. He Came Back And Offered Us Another Meal (By Which Time Our Friends Had Finished Eating). We Didn't Want Another Meal But It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had The Two Inedible Dishes Removed From Our Bill  Which They Weren't. I Wasn't Impressed With This For Customer Service.,,,,,
,609,Edwardian Had A Limited Menu (Beef Dishes Not On Offer When We Stayed  Which Was Part Of The Attraction In Booking Dinner There).  Service Generally In The Food Outlets Was Slow  And Largely Indifferent.  Some Of The Staff Were Friendly  Knowlegable And Helpful- Others Were Less So.  During The Later Part Of Breakfast Service Food And Drinks Became Scarce And Had To Ask For Scrambled Eggs  Bacon And Bottled Water  As None Were In Evidence And Took Some Time To Be Replenished.  Breakfast Meals Cooked To Order Were Ok But Overpriced  And Portion Sizes Generally In All Food Venues Were Modest.  Room Service Food Was Inconsistent- Ordered The Ceasar Salad And Had Cob Lettuce  Chicken Tenderloins And No Anchovies On One Occasion; Mixed Leaves  Anchovies And Sliced Chicken Breast On Another (Taste Was Good  But Disappointed To Have Enjoyed It The First Time And Gotten Something Altogether Different The Next).,,,,,
,610,Again Lacked Anything Special.  We Were Asked On Saturday Evening To Choose Our Table  As We Had Booked Sunday Lunch In The Edwardian Grill  Which We Did.  When We Went To The Restaurant On The Sunday All Of The Tables Had Been Removed.  We Asked What Was Going On And Were Told 'Oh Our Staff Xmas Party Is In There Tomorrow So You'll Have To Eat In The Small Room Over There'.  We Felt Let Down As This Was Supposed To Be A Special Birthday Celebration For Which My Parents Had Travelled To Join Us For.  No Apology!  Also Were Offered No Condiments To Go With Our Sunday Roast  But The Only Other Table In The Restaurant Were Offered These (Approx 8 Lunching Ladies).,,,,,
,611,Service In Edwardian Room Was Extremely Poor.  It Was Never Clear Which Server Was Helping Our Table.  Very Inattentive Overall.  And On Check-Out  Had A Number Of Items Billed To Us In Error From Edwardian -- Well Over Â£200 Of Incorrect Charges  Which Is Absolutely Not Acceptable.  Food Quality Was Better Than I Had Expected  However.,,,,,
,615,Castle Bistro Was Good For Casual Dining  And The High Tea An Excellent Experience With Family,,,,,
,618,Rated The Edwardian At Q12. The Blond Tall Lady Understood Her Job  But Better To Have One Person Attending Your Table Instead Of A Lot. Timing Was Bad  So Influenced Our Experience Negative. Even Once I Barely Finished And Our Plates Were Taking Away. Please Give Your People Extra Lessons In How To Attend Your Guests.  The Bistro Was A Disaster: Quality: Poor (To Salt  Overcooked Veg & Meat)  Presentation: Poor  Atmosphere: Fair-Poor  Overall: Very Poor. There Was Attending A Man That Obviously Wasn't Experienced And That Still Needed Guidance How To Host A Table. A Bistro Can Be The Hotspot If Run Properly. The Quality Of The Food Was Not Good. The Hotel And The Spa Where Lovely But We Would Not Recommend To Dine Here; Such A Shame! Hope You Will Make An Effort To Improve This  Because It Is Such A Lovely Hotel And Area. Good Luck!,,,,,
,619,Edwardian Grill Has Little Atmosphere; Appreciate Difficult In A Room With So Much Tradition  But Is Achievable In Some Places.  The Castle Bistro Menu Was Difficult To Choose From And Quite Standard - Fine For Most Bistros. However  I Feel That A Restaurant Within A Hotel With A Spa Should Offer More Healthy Alternatives. Food For Children Was Ok. I Thought The Idea Of A Film At Dinner Time Was A Good One. Thought Kitchen Staff In The Bistro Were Good; John Was Particularly Helpful.,,,,,
,620,The Staff In The Grill Were Excellent. Staff In The Bistro Very Mixed.,,,,,
,624,Cafe Bistro Was Slow And The Menu Limites,,,,,
,625,The Waiters Were Very Helpful Regarding My Husbands Gluten Free Diet. A Suggestion Would Be To Mark The Menu As To What Is/Can Be Made Gluten Free. In The Bistro  The Chef Put Gluten Free Bread In The Same Basket As Normal Bread  Which Will Cross-Contaminate It. It Is Important This Does Not Happen For Those With Coeliac Disease.,,,,,
,626,Lovely Food,,,,,
,627,Breakfast In The Edwardian Grill Was Amazing  Delicious And A Huge Choice. Sadly  Dinner In The Bistro Was Revolting. A Risotto Advertised As Made With Sundried Tomatoes And A Balsamic Glaze Was Cold When It Came Out  And Tasted Like Rapidly Boiled Pudding Rice Mixed With Packet Tomato Soup. No Evidence That Either Of The Aforementioned Ingredients Had Been Anywhere  Near The Dish. As We Didn't Want To Spoil What Was Otherwise A Lovely Stay We Didn't Send It Back  But We Would Not Eat Here Again.,,,,,
,629,Bistro Menu Was A Little Limiting And Would Have Liked To Have Seen Som Specials Offered To Add Variety To Our Dining Experience,,,,,
,631,Waiting Service A Little Slow When It Got Very Busy  But I Think They Were Doing Their Best  Just Not Enough Staff,,,,,
,632,The Restaurant Carpet Needed A Good Hoovering  There Were Crumbs All Over The Place.  In General It Felt A Bit Shabby And In Need Of Redecoration.  Unfortunately The Staff Were Really Bad.  There Was One Young Girl Who Poured Our Wine Who Knew Absolutely Nothing About Serving In General  It Was Almost As If She Hadn't Had Any Training At All - She Was Useless  I'm Sorry To Say.  I Did Feel Frustrated But I Didn't Let It Ruin The Evening.  I Had The Pasta On The Menu And It Was Horrible.  Again I Didn't Complain As Wanted The Whole Family To Enjoy The Evening.  Everyone Else Had The Steak And Fish And Seemed Quite Happy.  There Were 12 Of Us For Dinner And The Table Looked Really Lovely And Was In A Nice Area Of The Restaurant.,,,,,
,637,Loved It :),,,,,
,638,A Stunningly Beautiful Dining Room But Poor Waiting Staff - Miserable  Unattentive And Pretty Unhelpful On The Whole.,,,,,
,639,The Breakfast Was Slow As The Coffee Took A Long Time To Arrive And The Toast Was Cold,,,,,
,640,It Was All Lovely Apart From My Main Dish; Unfortunately My Dish Of Pork  Prawn  Pink Grapefruit And Lentils Was Not A Successful Combination,,,,,
,641,As Before,,,,,
,642,Service During Breakfast Was Consistently Poor.,,,,,
,643,No,,,,,
,645,A Little More Choice In The Bistro  I Am A Veggi And Would Have Used It More Often If More Options.,,,,,
,648,Breakfast Was Disappointing   The Staff Were Not Attentive In The Slightest. Had To Ask For Coffee And Tea . The Service Was Very Slow. To Be Brutally Honest A Buffet Is Not 5 Star. We Have Had Better . The Evening Meals Were Good And The Staff Were Very Friendly. Although We Had Steak On The Saturday Night And Were Not Given Steak Knives?,,,,,
,650,On The Friday Night Bistro Was Good  Young Lad Brown Excellent Service  As Conveyed To Franco.  On Saturday Night The Service In The Formal Restaurant Very Poor As Conveyed To Franco. Was Given Free Lunch In Bistro Sunday As Recompense. We Sat Down At 2.25Pm Ordered Straight Away A Hamburger And A Pizza. We Did Not Receive Food Until 3.15Pm!!! The Pregnant Lady Manager Apologized And Said The Ched Dropped The Pizza So Had To Start Again!! When It Did Finally Arrive Had No Olives On Which Is Why We Ordered. The Lady Manager Offered A Free Desert As Recompense !!! Not Knowing That Franco Had Given The Lunch Free As Recompense For Poor Saturday Service  Which I Will List Here:-  - Maitre D' Did Not Bring Wine Menu When We Ordered Food. I.E Said He Would Bring It So We Could Order Then Did Not - No Bread Rolls Offered Even Though Plate For Bread Rolls On Table - Blonde Hair Polisg Young Gent Did Not Bring Glass Of Water When Asked - We Reserved The Previous Day For 8.30Pm  Arrived At 8.30Pm  And Had To Wait On Sofa Until 8.45Pm      ,,,,,
,652,Breakfast - It Was Good To Have Freshly Cooked Hot Food (Rather Than Self Service Off Warmers) But The Continental Breakfast Was Very Limited Compared To Our Previous Visits.  For Example There Were No Raisins Or Similar Toppings  The Croissants Had Run Out One Morning  No Fruit Yoghurts On 2 Of The Mornings And Very Limited Amounts Of Fresh Cut Fruit Often With Only A Few Pieces Of Melon & Pineapple Put Out.  Also No Salmon And Limited Cheese  Although When I Asked  Some Lovely Blue Cheese Was Found  Thank You.  Also On A Couple Of Mornings There Were No Newspapers At Breakfast.  We Enjoyed What We Had But Found It Quite Limited Compared To Some Other Hotels We Have Stayed At Eg Wyndhams Chelsea Harbour.  We Had A Dinner In The Bistro Which Was Fine But Not Exceptional.  Its A Shame You've Changed The Ice Cream Supplier But We Were Very Pleased To See Fish And Chips Back On The Menu - Thank You.   As In The Rest Of The Hotel  The Staff We Met Were All Very Helpful.,,,,,
,653,I Dined In The Castle Bisto Which Was Good Although Quite Slow (I Guess You Were Quite Busy).  This Is A Great Place To Dine  Nice And Laid Back And I Never Tire Of The View From The Terrace.  I Had Breakfast Both Mornings In The Edwardian Grill.  The Choice Was More Expansive Than When I Last Stayed  But The Food Was Disappointing: - There Were No Fresh Berries (Strawberries  Raspberries  Blueberries) With The Fruit - The Bacon From The Hot Plate Was So Hard It Was Virtually Inedible  I Guess It Had Been There Some Time - The Orange Juice Didn't Taste Very Fresh - On The First Morning I Had Cereal  Hot Food & Pastries And None Of My Plates Were Cleared Until The End - No Toast Offered On The First Morning - Eggs Benedict On The 2Nd Morning Contained A Piece Of Foil,,,,,
,658,The Service Takes Too Long.,,,,,
,659,Good Choice Of Venues And Very Accommodating For Children (In The Bistro Particularly).,,,,,
,660,Wait Staff Are Adequate But Not Great.  The Restaurant Was Not Busy  Yet We Had Difficulty Attracting The Attention Of Our Waiter.  I Think Your Decision To Have Shared Tips Removes The Motivation For Service Excellence In The Wait Staff And It Showed.,,,,,
,665,The Bistro Doesn't Quite Capture The Elegance And Feel Of The Rest Of The Hotel. It Feels Like Many Other Diners And Bitros.,,,,,
,666,Unfortnately  The Food Was Not Good. The Pasta And The Leek Were Undercooked And The Risotto Was Overcooked.  We Have Booked A Nice Table In The Restaurant. Unfortnately  We Were Placed Next To The Kitchen Although The Edwardian Grill Was Almost Empty. The Staff Are Unconerned About That.,,,,,
,672,The Vegetarian Option Was Very Small Portioned For A Main Meal,,,,,
,673,The Meat Was Cooked As Ordered But Was Not Good,,,,,
,683,1)We Had An Excellent Meal Prepared For Us And Served In The Library.  2)The Presentation Of The Food At The Edwardian Featured A Bit Too Much 'Foam' On The Dishes  Perhaps A Bit Less ? 3) Great Pizza At The Bistro ! 4) We All Loved The Scones Served For High Tea At The Oak Bar.,,,,,
,684,We Had A Great Meal Which I Would Grade As Excellent From The Bbq In Castle Bistro. For Our Private Dining And Also For The Lunch Time Catering During Our Conference I Received Mixed Reviews And Improvements Could Have Been Made.,,,,,
,685,Bistro Staff Helpful And Accommodating.,,,,,
,686,Breakfast Service In Dining Room Was Incredibly Slow,,,,,
,687,In Conference Drink Breaks  There Were Not Enough Staff Serving.  We Would Have Been Happy To Pour Coffee Ourselves But Did Not Have Access To Coffee Pots Etc.,,,,,
,694,I Choose Beef As My Main Course  It Was Extremely Tough And Chewy.  I Requested A Steak Knife Which Really Didn't Help.  A Lot Of My Colleagues Sitting Nearby Had Also Chosen The Beef And Most Of Us Left At Least Half Of It!  Very Disapointing!,,,,,
,700,Cost Of One Gin & Tonic Was Â£12.80 Which Seemed Very High!!!,,,,,
,702,Very Good.  On The Sunday We Ate In The Bistro.  Due To The Wedding Fair They Were A Bit Overwhelmed And The Service Slowed But The Staff Were Friendly And Explained The Issues.,,,,,
,703,Perhaps A Wine Waiter Would Be A Good Idea  We Had Problems Ordering A Glass Of Rose Which Was Sweet.  The Chap Who Served Us Was Extremely Polite And Helpful And Did Bring Some Samples To My Wife For Her To Try After The Glass She Ordered Turned Out To Be Anything But Sweet  We Were Unable To Find A Suitable One In The End.  I Was A Bit Surprised To See We Had Still Been Charged For The Glass After The Waiter Offered To Take To Away For Us After Only A Sip To Taste Had Been Taken And When All Said And Done We Asked For A Sweet Rose When We Ordered And What We Received Was Not That.  Then Again I Do Recall Federico Giving Us Some Complimentary Glasses Of Champagne On Arrival As It Was Our Wedding Anniversary So Once Again He More Than Made Up For The Missunderstanding Re The Wine.,,,,,
,704,Edwardian Room And Oak Bar Were Excellent Experiences.  Service In The Bistro Was Poor The Night We Dined There.  I Still Rate The Overall Dining As Excellent As I View The Bistro Experience As An Anomaly.  However  If You Are Looking To Improve Something  I Would Focus On Upgrading The Service At The Bistro.,,,,,
,705,I Thought The Grill Could Have Done Betetr Based On The Prices. Was Disappointed With The Sommalier.  Bistro Service Was Slow And I Thought The Space Lacked Atmosphere And Charm,,,,,
,706,George The Sommelier Was Excellent And Chose A Great Wine For Us Based On Our Description Of What We Liked. Well Done!,,,,,
,711,First Meal (When Very Quiet) In Bistro Great. Second Time Round (Same Meal - Fish) Was Terrible. Staff Helpful And Replaced But Still Awful - Not Good Enough For A Hotel Like This. Afternoon Tea Was Good - Except Our Booking (Made Face To Face At Reception And Watched Them Phyiscally Made Note Of It) Mysteriously Disappeared - Staff Accomodated Us - But Not Warmly And Not In Great Position In Room.,,,,,
,712,Service A Bit Slow In The Bistro But Excellent Food And Friendly Staff.,,,,,
,713,We Were Advised On Arrival We Could Not Move Our Dining Reservation From 7:30Pm To 8Pm As You Were Busy But The Main Dining Room Never Filled Up More Than 60% To 70% Full. It Didn't Matter. The Food Was Good And The Sommelier Very Pleasant In Particular. We Did Have To Fill Our Wine Glasses Once Or Twice But I Have Even Had To Do That At Le Gavroche. We Retired To The Oak Room Where The Fire Was Not Lite As The Wood Was Apparently Too Wet But It Dried Out Enough To Be Lite The Following Lunchtime And Also In The Library As Well. On Our Day Of Departure We Were Advised We Could Have Something From 11Am In The Oak Room But Even Though It Was Empty We Were Advised Lots Of People Would Turn Up So Had To Eat In The Alcove By Reception. Not The Best Location But It Was Fine Although We Did Notice That By The Time We Left Bovey Only Four Chairs In Total Had Been Occupied In The Oak Room And None In The Library.,,,,,
,715,The Service In Both Restaurants Was Not Great. We Were Made To Wait For Quite A Long Time In Both And This Was Particularly Bad At Breakfast - On Both Days Of Our Stay. We Had To Wait For About 15-20 Minutes For A Table  Even Though Half The Restaurant Appeared To Be Empty. Once We Were Seated  It Also Took A Long Time To Just Get Our Hot Drinks And We Had To Keep Asking For Things That Seemed To Be Forgotten.,,,,,
,718,Breakfast Service Is Fine But Our Experience At The Bistro Was Terrible.  Limited Menu And Poor (Slow) Service.  Not A Big Deal If Only Staying A Day Or Two But If You Stay For The Week  It Becomes A Problem Given The Menu Never Changes.,,,,,
,720,Service In Both Restaurants Was Extremely Poor.,,,,,
,723,Would Be Nice To Have Lunchtime Sandwiches Available  Other Than In Bistro. This May Be Available But Wasn't Aware Of It.,,,,,
,727,The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent. I Would Have Liked More Choice In The Bistro Grill. A Choice Of A Few Salads (With For Example Roasted Vegetables) Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,
,730,Felt A Bit Haphazared In Terms Of Layout During Lunch.,,,,,
,731,Excellent Serving Staff,,,,,
,732,The Staff In The Castle Bistro Were Very Friendly And Helpful  As Opposed To The Edwardian Grill  Who Were Very Starchy And Unfriendly,,,,,
,733,Slightly Disappointe Din The Quality Of The Food. I Guess I Just Expect Ed More.  The Pavlova With Blueberry Compote Was Particularly Disappointing.,,,,,
,735,The Tv Was Too Loud And The Food Was A Bit Too Expensive Compared To How It Tasted...,,,,,
,740,The Staff Were Very Efficient And Friendly.,,,,,
,741,Lovely Lunch But Too Many Visits To The Table,,,,,
,744,My Mum Had Booked For A Birthday Cake And Cheese Board To Be Ready In Our Lodge On Our Arrival Which Was A Lovely Surprise And Both Were Absolutely Delicious And Beautifully Presented  Thank You.  The Cheeseboard Had A Large Selection And It Was Great To Be Able To Try Some Of The More Unusual Ones.,,,,,
,745,Excellent Food But There Didn't Appear To Be Sufficient Staff In The Restaurant To Ensure A Reasonable Speed Of Service.,,,,,
,746,The Choice Was A Little Limited In The Edwardian Grill. We Did Not Eat At The Castle Bistro As It Was Not Very Inviting?,,,,,
,748,Amazing Food. Great Service And Was Made To Feel Very Special. Superb All Round.,,,,,
,756,Great Main Course  Lovely Drinks In Relaxed Bar Before Hand  Great Canapã©S All Superb  Pre Mean Service Was Outstanding.  Deserts Not So Good...Al Around Us Diners Had The Sorbet (Boring) We Had The Pumpkin Pie  Soggy Pastry And Chocolate Ice Cream Didn't Really Go - Such A Shame After An Awesomes Starter And Main.,,,,,
,758,Waiter Smelt And Knowledge Of The Menu Not Good,,,,,
,759,Menu Very Limited. All Meat (Beef) Fish  And Vegetarian. No Duck Or Chicken  Salmon Or Goat's Cheese Or Decent Pates. Menu Did Not State If Veg Included. No Veg With Main Course Selected. Menu Rather Old Fashioned English Cuisine. Lack Of Meditteranean Dishes. No Soup Stated On Menu. Carrot Cake Was A One Inch Diameter Muffin. The Chocolate Dessert Was Far Too Rich. Dessert Menu Not Very Exciting.,,,,,
,760,Vegetarian Menu Overpriced And Main Courses Lacking In Texture. Cooked Breakfast Was Not As High Quality As I Expected.,,,,,
,763,We Were Very Impressed.,,,,,
,774,Very 'Average' Food,,,,,
,775,Shame Bistro Not Open Weekday Evenings,,,,,
,778,Katarina Our Sommelier Was Excellent. Very Efficient And Extremely Friendly With Us And Our 3 Children .The Cheesebord On The Night We Dined Was Quite Poor(Lots Of Choice But Fairly Old) The Waiter Who Served Was Not Knowledgeable At All. We Did Find It Slightly Amusing To See A Cheese Delivery Van Coming To The Castle The Next Day. That Said One Really Doesnt Expect Cheese Of That Quality To Be Served In An Establishment Like Yours .,,,,,
,784,The Hotel Is A Special Place But The Food Doesnt Quite Match Up To Expectations. The Sunday Lunch Was Very Average And Slow Service Ment We Did Not Get Offered The Desert Menu Or Asked If We Wanted More To Drink -  Both Cases We Would Have Said Yes.   We Ate Mainly In The Bistro Due To The Kids And There Seemed To Be Some Serious  Problems Getting The Food Out  - We Waited Over An Hour On Two Of The 3 Nights And Could See Other Diners Were Also Complaining.,,,,,
,792,We Adore Your Scones.,,,,,
,793,Explained Previously - Bistro Is Looking Shabby And No Atmosphere  Also Music Too Loud For Me. Menu Choice Very Limited - Dessert Option Very Restricted,,,,,
,795,The Bistro Food Was Terrible With The Exception Of The Pizza. The Bistro Atmosphere Is Also Awful. It Needs A Re-Think And Redesign. We Went Out To The Local Pub One Night And Enjoyed It Much More! The Bistro Feels Like A Fast Food Joint  Especially With The Screaming Kids!,,,,,
,796,The Table We Had Was Placed Over Some Moving Floorboards  Every Time Someone Walked Past Our Table My Husband Was Swaying From Side To Side!  Informed The Staff That In Future Not To Place The Table In That Position Again   Husband Received A Complementary Port And Cheese.,,,,,
,797,The Evening Started Off Very Well With Drinks In The Bar And Someone Coming To Take Our Order For Dinner. This Was About 7.45Pm. An Hour Later We Decided To Go Down To The Restaurant Ourselves. We Were Welcomed In The Restaurant But With A Note Of Suprise. When The Starters Arrived One Was Not The Starter That Had Been Ordered. So Then We Had A Long Wait While The Correct Starter Was Prepared. The Table Had Been Booked For 8.15Pm But All Of The Above Meant That We Ended Up Eating Really Late And The Evening Was Not As Enjoyable As We Had Hoped It Would Be.,,,,,
,800,The Food Was Not Very Hot However I Appreciate There Was A Large Party To Cater For,,,,,
,802,The Night We Were Meant To Dine In The Edwardian Grill The Staff Brought Our Menus To The Lounge.  The Kids Were Wishing Out Loud That We Could Eat Our Dinner In That Room.  They Asked The Staff And They Very Kindly Obliged Us.  The Children Were Thrilled And I Was Very Impressed!,,,,,
,803,Menu During Our Stay Became A Bit Monotonous As Generally The Same Items Were On Offer Each Evening  With Minimal Changes To The Main Courses. Choice Of A Beef Dish Would Have Been A Good Idea. No A La Carte Menue Available  Only A Fixed Price Offering  So A Bit Disappointing. Portions Sometimes Small And Food Didn't Always Hit The Mark.,,,,,
,807,Castle Bistro Was Excellent And Good Value For Money. The Edwardian Grill And My Steak Dinner Was Not As Good As I Was Expecting  It Was Ok But I Had Been To A Number Of Places Where It Was Better ,,,,,
,810,The Service At The Bar Was Not Good. No 'Good Evening'  No Looking If Guests Have Arrived.  The Young Female Bartender  Though  Was Very Friendly.  Although We Had Half Board We Did Not Get Any Olives Etc. The Day We Dined At The Bistro. Always The Same Music.,,,,,
,811,During Breakfast On Both Mornings The Staff Appeared Disorganised,,,,,
,812,Bistro Staff Were Very Helpful   Polite And Inviting Grill  Staff Were Verging On Rude  Definitely Unhelpful  And Made Both Dinner And Breakfast Less Enjoyable Than It Should Have Been. A Great Pity  Because I Would Happily Return To And Recommend Bovey  If It Wasn't For The Grill Experience !,,,,,
,816,Steak Was Delicious  Salads Poorly Dressed With Cheese That Clearly Hadn't Been Freshly Grated. Pizza Good  But Shortage Of Boards So Poorly Presented & Hard To Cut. Service Unreliable.  We Would Have Liked To Eat In The Eg But Found The Menu Over Elaborate. With The Lack Of Ambiance & Unchanging Menu In The Bistro We Very Much Felt There Was No Acceptable Middle Ground. Breakfast Was Disappointing. Sunday Buffet Scrambled Eggs Over Cooked & Inedible. Oj Delicious. Service Slow And Unreliable.,,,,,
,818,Please Bring Back The Wagu Beef - Sadly Missed! :-(  We Drove A Long Way To Try It Only To Find It Was Not On The Menu  Even Though Your Website Said It Was!,,,,,
,819,The Food Was Good - Disappointing Tha The Grill Menu Did Not Change Over The Two Nights  And Was Identical On Each Night,,,,,
,820,We Were Told That There Were No Tables Available For Sunday Lunch And Had To Refer To The Hotel Manager- Actually The Restaurant Had Plenty Of Availability.,,,,,
,824,Shambolic!!!!  However Wedding Breakfast Was Good!,,,,,
,825,The Bistro Was Appalling Service.  The Wedding Meal Was Exceptional Except It Appeared That Quite A Few Were Not Served Tea Or Coffee Although Cups And Saucers Were Placed On The Tables.,,,,,
,829,Edwardian Grill Was Over Priced For Quality Of The Food. The Bistro Food We Found Disappointing. Fish Was Over Cooked And Gammon Dry. Bread With Oil /Dip Arrived With Main Meals. Service Seemed Disorganised Or New? Oak Bar Very Nice But Again Disappointed With Cheese And Ham Sandwich At Â£10.00 ..Very Dry And  Needed Some Pickle?,,,,,
,830,We Enjoyed The Experience However The Food Was Expensive Compared To Some Great Restaurants In London   When You Arrived And Were Sat For Breakfast You Were Offered Tea / Coffee And Also The Toast Came At The Same Time Before You Had Even Chosen What You Were Going To Have For Breakfast. My Major Point Would Be 12.5% Service Charge Added To Your Bill. Â£10 For A Gin And Tonic Is Expensive In Any Venue And I Travel Worldwide Every Week Of The Year Just About  What Is The Service Charge For  You Have To Put The Drink In The Glass In Order To Serve It Which Negates The Service Charge.,,,,,
,832,The Above Marks Are For Our Experience In The Edwardian Grill. The Marks For Our Experience In The Castle Bistro Would Have Been 'Good' '2' For All Three Categories.,,,,,
,833,Could Have Been A Different Menu Lunchtime & Evening In The Bistro. Got A Bit Boring So We Chose To Eat Out At Lunchtime.  Staff Were Fantastic Though.  Sometimes Things Were Not Available Which Is Disappointing When You Are Looking Forward To It!,,,,,
,835,The Bistro Service And Food Were A Little Below Par For Such An Establishment. We Had To Find A Waitress  Who Took 10 Mins To Bring Wine To Table Despite Having No Other Guests To Serve. My Mussels Had The Appearance And Taste Of Items Left Waiting Under The Hot Lamp For A While. You Having A Charming Young  Team And At 1500Hr In The Afternoon I Can Understand They Might Be Flagging A Bit After Lunch Time Rush  But A Little More Training On Attention To Detail And Focused Customer Service Would Lift Them To True 5 Star Quality,,,,,
,836,Edwardian Grill - Beef Wellington Was Fantastic. Sweet (Rhubarb Disappointing - Had To Use A Knife To Cut The Rhubarb 'Sticks') Castle Bistro - Saturday - Fish & Chips (Fish Very Over-Cooked - Batter Dark / Fish Dry) Breakfast Menu - Excellent,,,,,
,837,It Was Nice But A Bit Bland And Predictable,,,,,
,839,The Comments Above Relate To The Edwardian Grill. The Bistro Was Good In Every Aspect.,,,,,
,840,I Think Some Meals Were Overpriced And The Additional Service Charge Is Quite High As More Use To 10%,,,,,
,841,Have Commented On Dinner In The Edwardian Grill  Which Was Excellent. We Also Had Dinner In The Castle Bistro  The Food Quality Was Excellent  Unfortunately Let Down By The Service. A Spanish Waiter Had Poor Appearance  Could Not Answer Simple Questions  And Got The Order Wrong. We Thought He Was New But We Were Told He Had Been There 9 Months. The Female Waitress Thankfully Rescued The Situation.,,,,,
,842,Those Comments Were More For The Edwardian Restaurant. The Bistro Service Was Poor And Food Cld Be Improved.,,,,,
,846,High Quality Food,,,,,
,849,Pricey,,,,,
,850,I Was Not Sure About The Service Charge For Both Resteraunt And Bar On The Bill.  Also  At Breakfast It Wasn't Clear Whether All That Was Offered On The Menu Was Part Of The B & B Package Paid For Or If The Additional Menu Attracted The Additional Cost.,,,,,
,852,Bistro Was Not Very Good - Slow And Indifferent Service And Food Not Special.  Edwardian Was Quite Good  But Due To A Wedding  We Could Not Use It As Much As We Wanted.,,,,,
,853,The Food Was Excellent And The Service Attentive. It Was However Slightly Disappointing In Two Aspects.  It Was Distressing To Find Green Mould On One Of Ther Loaves Of Bread At Breakfast On The Morning Of July 26Th. Although The Staff Were Most Apologetic When We Told Them (And Removed The Item Immediately)  I Cannot Understand How This Was Allowed To Happen. The Explanation Given Was That The Bread Was Baked Locally And The Offending Item Being From 'Yesterday'. That's Not Really Good Enough.  We Were Very Much Looking Forward To The Cheese Trolley Which You (Rightly) Are Proud Of. It Would Have Been Much Enhanced Had The Waiter Had More Than A Basic Knowledge Of The Cheeses On Offer. Although Able To Tell Us What They Were  He Did Not Have The Level Of Knowledge To Make Recommendations. I Don't Know What The Equivalent Of A Somellier Is For Cheese  But We Have Stayed At Other Hotels (E G  Ockenden Manor) Where This Has Been The Case - It Enhances The Overall Experience.,,,,,
,854,Overpriced  3.80 For A Glass Of Coke Or 1.90 For An Ice Cream Cone?,,,,,
,857,The Above Rating Only Relates To The Edwardian. The Bistro Was Poor In Terms Of Atmosphere  Design And Food Quality.  The Wine List At The Edwardian Is Not Phenomenal. Maybe The Restaurant Should Emply A Sommelier (Or  If There Is One  We Never Got To See Him/Her),,,,,
,858,We Were Surprised Only Once Did The Matre D Top Up Our Wine  We Had To Do It Ourselves  This Was Not Good Enough In A Fine Dining Restaurant  Its Fair To Say The Service Was A Disappointment.,,,,,
,859,No,,,,,
,860,The Fish Dishes Were First Class. Really Enjoyed The Food.,,,,,
,863,When The Piano Music Stopped  The Dining Room Was Uncomfortably Quiet. Some Soft Background Music Would Have Made A Lot Of Difference.,,,,,
,864,Maybe The Service Was Slighty A Bit Slower Than We Would Have Liked But Only Just And Not A Particular Issue,,,,,
,865,The Level Of Service At The Bistro Is Very Different To The Bar / Dining Room - Quite Slow At Bistro,,,,,
,866,Federico Was Very Kind To Give Me A Cutting Board. Very Much Appreciated His Gesture And Kindness,,,,,
,869,Ate At The Bistro Twice. The Service Was Patchy And Slow. A Big Issue  Although Contraversial  Is The Waiters Did Not Understand The Conversations. We Tried To Explain No Dairy In Our Dishes. A Long Story But One Adult And 2 Small Children Ended Up With 5 Large Pizzas. The Chef Came Out And Sorted It. The Food Was Then Good. The Staff Need A Large Slice Of Motivation And Need To Be Able To Communicate,,,,,
,875,Aiming For A Michelin Star?,,,,,
,884,The Edwardian Grill Was Being Used For The Corporate Event Therefore We Ate In The Small Dining Room  The Ambience Was Perfect For A Small Number Of Diners And The Food Was Excellent!,,,,,
,885,The Room Service Menu Was A Little Limited.,,,,,
,886,Felt That Food In The Edwardian Grill Was Over Priced,,,,,
,887,Lack Of Information Given. We Ordered Scones And Tea In The Oak Bar On Arrival. The Tea Was Delivered But  Five Minutes Later I Had To Go To Find The Waiter To Enquire Where The Scones Were.,,,,,
,890,Overall Excellent.  Would Have Enjoyed Nuts/Olives/Etc To Go With Drinks Whilst Waiting To Order Etc.  Also 'Chocolate' Or Sweet With Coffee Would Have Been Lovely Too!,,,,,
,891,Whilst The Waiting Staff Were Attentive  We Did Experience Lengthy Delays To Our Meals In The Edwardian Grill.  There Are Clearly Issues As To How Meals Are Produced In The Kitchen.  In The Castle Bistro  The Waiting Staff Were Again Very Attentive And Friendly But I Found The Menu Rather Limiting.  Whilst I Applaud The Choice Of Main Courses On Offer For The Children  The Only Vegetables On Offer Were Peas Or Mushy Peas  And Ice Cream The Only Option For Pudding Which Our 2 Year Old Doesn't Like.  Perhaps The Yoghurts Available At Breakfast Could Be Made Available  Or Even Fresh Fruit Like Bananas Or Pears  Or Strawberries.,,,,,
,892,The Evening Meal Was In The Bar And I Had A Starter As A Main  It Was Ok  The Atmosphere Was And The Staff 'Chat' A Little Over Bearing. Breakfast Buffet Fruit Salad Was Beyond It's Best By 8.00Am. I Dined Alone In The Edwardian Restaurant  Again No Atmosphere. I Do Appreciate That Occupancy Will Have Been Low During My Visit Which Does Not Help. Consider Moving Breakfast To Another Smaller Part Of The Hotel During Low Occupancy And Re-Consider Buffet Products To Ensure They Remain Fresh.,,,,,
,893,If I Had Any Criticism At All It Was The Music On The Thursday Night That Was Played In The Bar - It Was Not To Our Taste And Was Played Rather Loudly.  The Piano Music In The Restaurant Was Fantastic And Perfect For The Venue.,,,,,
,894,The Filet Steak Was Very 'Rubbery' And Not Very Flavourful.  Although It Had Grill Marks It Almost Tasted Like It Had Been Baked And Not Broiled/Grilled.  Not Worth The Money At All.  However  The Beef Wellington Was Excellent.  Also  Try Adding A Top Napa Valley Wine To Your Menu.  Staff Was Excellent In Restaurant And In The Bar Next Door.,,,,,
,895,The Service Was Poor  Only One French Guy Had A Good Education. The Young People Are Not Very Good Trained,,,,,
,896,The Edwardian Grill Was Very Good. Especially When You Can Hear The Piano Player. When He Stops You Need Piped Music As The Atmosphere Drops Considerably. Everybody Feels They Have To Talk Very Quietly.,,,,,
,899,The Secret Escapes Offer Was Slightly Misleading. I Booked On The Basis Of Dinner In Either Of The Restaurants Each Night But Once I Had Booked/Paid The Booking Then Made Clear The Limitations Ie Limited For The Bistro And Supplement For The Edwardian.  The 'Small Print' Had Not Been Clear.  Also The Bistro Was A Bit Empty On The Sat Night So We Felt A Bit On Our Own!,,,,,
,902,Service Is A Little Slow. The Was Plenty Of Staff But We Seemed To Get Different People All The Time. For An Improvement I Would Suggest Better Eye Contact. Some Of Us Do Not Like Having To Wave A Lot. But Then Again We Were Getting Away From It All.,,,,,
,904,Enjoyed Both Dinners  Although Was A Bit Put Off By The Bistro Menu  Which Was Rather Carb-Heavy  And Would Have Benefitted From Some Lighter Choices  Especially Salads And Fish (Not Fish And Chips!),,,,,
,906,Bistro Was Excellent Although Could Update Menu Every 2-3 Days. Edwardian Grill Very Very Slow And Sat Next To A Radiator So Not Comfortable (Just Told To Open The Window !). Cancelled Subsequent Bookings. Room Service Menu In Room Needs Updating.,,,,,
,908,The Edwardian Grill Evening Meal On First Night The Food And Service Was Excellent. Unfortunately The Same Could Not Be Said For The Bistro On Second Evening. Pastries Were Burnt On Second Breakfast,,,,,
,910,The Restaurant Manager Was Verging On The Rude.  The Portions In The Edwardian Grill Were Small And We Waited An Hour For Our Main Course Despite There Being Only 12 Other Guests.  The Decor In The Bistro Was Unwelcoming (Not Even Place Mats On The Tables - Like Being In A Staff Canteen!).  The Bistro Stank Of Chips And The Food Was Of Poor Quality With Cheap Ingredients.,,,,,
,912,The Evening We Ate In The Edwardian Grill Is Was Rather Empty So Lacked Ambience.,,,,,
,914,I Thought The Food At Dinner Was Quite Good But Not Fantastic (Eg Halibut And Sea-Bass A Little Over-Cooked  Risotto With Sea-Bass A Bit Unsubtle  Beef Loin Disappointing).  I Thought It Was Very Disappointing That The Menus At Both Restaurants Did Not Change At All During Our 6 Night Stay - Teh Only Variable Being The Soup Of The Day In The Bistro.  I Don't Know Whether Breakfast Is Covered In A Later Question But I Thought That (I) The Cost Of Breakfast Ought To Be Included  Given The Very High Cost Of The Rooms And (Ii) The Quality Wasn't Great.  The Pastries  Particularly The Pain Au Raisins  Were Stodgy And Heavy  The Fruit Unimaginative And The Hot Buffet Looked Pretty Unimaginative.  I Think Teh Breakfast Experience Coudl Be Hugely Improved,,,,,
,915,The Friday Evening Meal Put On For Succession Guests Was Awful,,,,,
,919,Edwardian Grill Lacked Atmosphere - Very Hushed - And Some Dishes Were Disappointing (Sea Bass Was Ruined By An Overpowering Sauce. Had A Long Wait For A Second Glass Of Wine During Dinner. Breakfast Buffet Was Bland And Limited Compared With Previous Stays In The Past.  Castle Bistro Had More Of A Buzz But The Service Was Erratic. French Waiter Had No Idea About The Wine Choices - Suspect It Was His First Day On The Job.,,,,,
,920,I Think The Bistro Food Is Poor For Such A 5 Star Venue And Has No Atmosphere - I Remember This From Last Time But We Thought We Would Eat There Again As We Were With 2 Boys Of 12 Years Old. It Was No Better This Time.  The Edwardian Grill Is Lovely - The Consomme I Had Was Lovely But I Have To Say My Haddock Was Pretty Indifferent.  The Boys Enjoyed Their . I Think Bovey Is Lovely But I Have To Say The Food Experience This Time Would Be The One Thing That Might Stop Us Coming Again.,,,,,
,921,The Food  Service And Experience Was Far Better In The Grill Than The Bistro,,,,,
,925,Generally The Food Was Of A Poor Standard.  Breakfast Was A Poor Experience  Cold Coffee  Soggy Toast And Additional Charge For Non Buffet Food.  A Bit Of A Rip Off To Be Honest And Not Very Organised,,,,,
,928,We Debated Your Restaurant Options At Length Prior To Our Visit And Chose The Castle Bistro As We Saw The Baked Cod Option On The Online Menu And This Seemed An Attractive Choice. On Arrival At The Bistro We Found This Was Not On The Menu And Ended Up With Pasta And Pizza Which Although Acceptable Did Not Provide The Expereince We Were Hoping For. I Understand That The Online Menus Are Only Provided As A Guide But In Hindsight If We Were To Return We Would Choose The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,931,I Was Disappointed With The Menu Of The Edwardian Grill.  Thought For Such A Beautiful Hotel The Menu Did Not Reflect.,,,,,
,933,I Think Action Is Already Being Taken To Bring The Standards Of Food And Service Up To The Level That Would Be Expected.  We Were Reluctant To Try The Edwardian Grill  Based On Our Experiences In The Castle Bistro.  The Morning Coffee Was V V Strong.,,,,,
,935,Potential To Change The Menu More Frequently And When I Asked If We Could Get Sandwiches We Were Told No. Reality Is  If We Had Known Or Been Informed Correctly  We Could Have Got Sandwiches In The Lounge.,,,,,
,936,Was Not Tempted To Visit Grill On This Occasion - Lacked Atmosphere  Very Few People Dining.,,,,,
,938,Menu At The Bistro Was Extremely Limited - No Salads For Example.  We Had Planned To Eat There A Second Evening But There Was Nothing We Would Want To Eat So We Went To Moretonhampstead Horse Pub And The White Hart On The Third Evening Which Were Both Great.,,,,,
,939,The Only Problem Was Lots Of Children Making A Noise And Walking Around Throughout The Meal.  Possibly Set Aside A Time For Family Dining And Others Dining At The Bistro.,,,,,
,941,Food And Wine Were Excellent.  Room Lacked Atmosphere Due To Lack Of Guests!,,,,,
,947,Athough The Food Was Good  It Was Far Too Expensive.  Tea And Coffee Arrived Cold.,,,,,
,948,The Service Was Excellent - Maybe A Little Overbearing With The Waitress Topping Up The Drinks With Every Sip We Took   Also The Pepper Mill Was Empty!,,,,,
,968,We Have Always Enjoyed Meals In The Edwardian Grill On Previous Visits But Were Disappointed On This Occasion.  The Menu Didn't Tempt And The Food Was Disappointing -  I Had To Return My Steak  Which Is A First For Me.  Cezar  The Restaurant Manager  Was Excellent  However.  His Manner And Attention To Detail Was First Class And He Attempted To Make Up For The Disappointment And Delay With My Meal.,,,,,
,969,Good Food And Service. Enjoyed Every Minute As Staff Very Attentive.,,,,,
,971,We Were Disappointed With The Length Of Service And The Waiting Time Between Courses.  We Asked For Our Daughters Dessert While We Were Still On Our Mains.  When We Had Finished My Wife Ordered Her Dessert And I Ordered A Coffee And Petit Fours.  I Received My Coffee Within 5 Minutes Another 10 Minutes Later My Wife's Dessert Arrived With Our Daughters Pudding.  35 Minute Wait For And I Quote A Ten Year Olds Words 'It's All Hard And Rubbery'.  Obviously The Sticky Toffee Pudding Was Microwaved  But Too Much.  It Was Far Too Long For Her To Wait  Not Impressed.,,,,,
,973,The Restaurant Was Very Busy - It Took A While For Our Wine Waiter To Return To Us And Pour Our Wine (After He Was Called Over).,,,,,
,976,Perhaps It Would Be A Good Idea To Heat The Plates When Sending Hot Food To Room Service.Your Water Needs Filtered As There Is A Strong Chlorine Taste From The Tea Which We Experienced From Different Areas Of Your Hotel.,,,,,
,978,Soup Wasn't Hot Enough At Lunchtime.  Evening Meal Was Average.,,,,,
,979,Food In The Dining Room Good But Over Priced. If You Are Going To Promote A Cheese Course With An Extensive Selection At Â£14 A Head Then You Should Deliver That - Not A Blind Choice From A Verbal List Provided By The Waiter!,,,,,
,983,Could Change Menu And Breakfast Was Just Ok,,,,,
,986,Got Offered The Worst Table In Front Of The Door Even Just Two People Were Sitting And I Made The Booking Month In Advance And At The End The Restaurant Was Not Even Fully Booked. Wine Came Even After Our Reminding Only After We Finished Dinner. Nevertheless  Most Of Waiters Were Very Friendly And Nice.,,,,,
,991,It Feels Institutional.  The Bistro Is Odd And The Dining Room Huge,,,,,
,993,Had To Ask For Wine Glass To Be Topped Up. Also Had To Chase A Cup Of Tea,,,,,
,997,One Thought How About Offering A Special Menu In Addition The Main.,,,,,
,998,The Gentleman Who Managed Your Breakfast Room Was Extremely Engaging And Friendly ..... Lovely.,,,,,
,999,We Didn't Have The Opportunity But I Am Sure The Main Restaurant Would Also Have Been Excellent.,,,,,
,1000,We Stayed 3 Nights And Were Very Disappointed To Find That The Edwardian Menu Never Changed. While What We Had Was Of Reasonable Quality   It Was Depressing To Find It Never Changed. At The Bistro We Felt Your Staff Were Under Trained   Poor In Their Grasp Of English And Not Well Managed  Service Was Very Slow And Sometimes Forgotten About. Although We Were Enjoying Exceptionally Good Weather We Felt It Astonishing That A Hotel Aspiring To Your Target Market Had No Sun Shades/Parasols Around The Outdoor Tables   Nor Were There Any Patio Heaters To Enjoy The Outdoor Areas When Evening Chill Set In,,,,,
,1001,We Had Eaten At A 2 Michelin Star Restaurant The Night Before And Bc Was On A Par.,,,,,
,1002,There Should Be Draft Beer In The Oak Room Not Just At The Bistro.,,,,,
,1003,Some Of The Dishes Were Fab  But Venison Sausage Cassoulet Was A Very Dried Out Affair  As If It Had Been Cooked Days Ago Then Put In The Oven And All Dried Out. Strawberry Mousse Also Looked Old With A Slight Skin. Other Food Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1004,We Had A Lovely Meal In The Edwardian Grill And Enjoyed Our Evening There. The Bistro Was Very Empty And That Meant It Had No Atmosphere.,,,,,
,1006,I Am Sorry But The Food Was All But Inedible And Incredibly Expensive.  Without Going Into Detail  The Dishes Were Unappetising To Look At And The 'Chef' Had No Idea About Complementing Ingredients.  My Sea Bass (Overcooked) Was Lying On A Mass Of Overpowerful  Revolting Looking Crab Risotto.  It Was An Insult To The Fish.  Worse Was The 'Ravioli'.  Overcooked  Thick  Dried Out Lasagne Pasta Surrounding Pureed Potato Concealing An Egg Yolk.  I Also Have To Tell You That The Afternoon Tea Was Equally Disappointing Not Only Due To The Poor Quality Of The Fare But The Staff Who Were Inefficient And Incredibly Slow To Serve.  We Were Not Asked Which Tea We Wanted But Simply Brought 'English Breakfast'!  For Afternoon Tea?  I Think You Need To Look Carefully At Staff Training And You Seriously Need To Look At What Is Being Served In The Restaurant.  I've Enjoyed Better Food In Any High Street Chain Restaurant.,,,,,
,1007,The Food Choices Were Not To My Taste And Since I Was With A Group I Wasn't At Liberty To Request Other Options.  I Think The Staff Did As Good A Job As Possible In Providing For Our Needs And They Truly Bent Over Backwards For All Our Varied Requests.  My Challenge Is I Just Don't Eat This Much  As These Hours And The Types Of Offerings  So I Was Always Picking At My Food.  I Am Uncomfortable Leaving So Much Food Uneaten And Wasted But Did Not See Any Way Around It Given The Confines Of The Situation.,,,,,
,1008,The Edwardian Grill Was A Wonderful Dining Experience And Rivaled Our Experiences In London. We Thought The Bistro Had A Very Limited Menu And Would Have Appreciated A Selection Of Sandwiches And/Or Salads Or Lighter Fare For Lunch And A Different Menu For Dinner. Wish We Had Had A Chance To Work In Tea.,,,,,
,1009,The Edwardian Grill Is In Need Of Updating To Provide A More Intimate Experience.The Castle Bistro For Evening Dining Appeared To Be Lacking In Atmosphere  Almost Akin To A Cafeteria.,,,,,
,1010,Expensive And Small Portions In The Edwardian Grill.  The Mains Were Very Good  But The Deserts Not Special Enough Flavour Wise.  As A Coeliac I Was Well Catered For.  We Don't Mind Paying The Money But Would Expect Better Experience In Terms Of Flavour.  Also As A Sunday Evening You Were Not Full And Yet Chose To Sit Us All Close Together Such That One Could Hear Conversations Even When 'Whispered'. We Preferred The Bistro The Next Day As A General Dining In The Sense That The Cost Matched The Experience.,,,,,
,1016,Slow Service !!!,,,,,
,1017,A Bit More Variety In The Bistro Would Be Nice  Especially Vegetarian.,,,,,
,1021,I Am A Real Foodie And Was Expecting Excellence!!  So Tough One.  I Have Already Made An Earlier Comment Re Front Of House.  The Food Was Good Although Lacked The Real Top Quality Flavours/Dimensions.  The Menu Was Nicely Balanced Although Prices Were Rather Expensive And Food Tended To Be A Bit On The Heavy Side.   There Were Only 6 People In The Restaurant And Think This Reflects The Excellent Bistro Option And Value.,,,,,
,1023,Husband's Breakfast Fish Seemed To Upset His Stomach.  Did Not Show Up Until Later On In The Day That We Left.  In Hindsight It Did Seem Underdone.  Our Dinner However Was Superb,,,,,
,1024,I Didn't Appreciate Having To Ask Four Different Members Of Staff For Our Coffee After The Evening Meal And Wait About 20 Minutes For It  I Was About To Get Up And Leave When It Did Eventually Arrive. Also We Had Lunch In The Bistro Before Leaving On Sunday  I Ordered Smoked Salmon With Rustic Bread And Also A Salad  After We Had Finished I Realised I Had Not Had The Rustic Bread And Told The Waiter Who Said He Would Adjust The Bill Which He Had Just Brought Us. He Deducted The Service Charge From The Bill But Surely He Should Have Deducted Money From The Food And Then Readded The Service Charge To The New Sub-Total As His Way Made It Look Like We Didn't Want To Pay A Service Charge.,,,,,
,1028,I Have Already Sent You An E Mail And Have Had No Acknowledgement Or Reply.,,,,,
,1029,Staff Needs Better Training  The Food Was Not Bad But Overpriced For The Quality. The Experience Was Between Fair And Poor But In The End Not That Poor. People Made An Effort And We Appreciate That.,,,,,
,1030,Breakfast Toast Was Far Too Undercooked But By Then I Was Past Wanting To Complain,,,,,
,1031,The Menu Was Restricted Because Of The Low Occupancy.  I Chose The Hotel Because The Website Promised A Wide Range Of Food.  My Husband Is Seriously Ill And Eating Is Very Difficult For Him.  We Found Ourselves Struggling With Inadequate Choices.  The Staff Did Their Best To Help  And I Thank Them For That  But I Really Could Have Done Without This Extra Stress.,,,,,
,1034,We Went For Pre Dinner Drinks In The Oak Bar And Felt That We Were Treated Differently With Almost A Two Tier System. Anyone Dining In The Al A Carte Restaurant Was Provided With Nibbles To Accompany Their Drinks. When I Asked Our Server For Some  He Referred To Another Member Of Staff And We Overheard Him Saying  No Not For Us As We Were Dining In The Bistro. I Was Very Annoyed With This Attitude And Insisted On Some Nibbles And Was Given A Few Nuts In A Bowl.  The Only Downside Of The Whole Visit And Not A Pleasant Start To The Evening Which Was A Celebration Birthday Meal.,,,,,
,1035,We Booked The Bistro But As This Was Closed We Were Told We Would Be Dining In The Grill But With The Bistro Menu. Pre- Dinner Drinks In The Bar Were Shambolic. We Were Not Offered Dinner Menus Before Being Asked To Choose Wine And Had To Get Them Ourselves. The Bar Staff Seemed Inexperienced And Gave A Dry Wine When Asked For A Fino Sherry. We Were Given Canapes Without Warning  Having Ordered Olives And Nibbles. The Person Taking Our Dinner Order Was Poorly Informed Regarding The Details Of Dishes And Went To Consult A Colleague But Did Not Reappear. Finally The Very Helpful Female Member Of Staff Took Our Order. In The Restaurant It Did Not Seem That Anyone Was In Charge And It Lacked Coordination And Clear Supervision And Attention To Detail.,,,,,
,1040,The Food And Service At Dinner Was Very Good. However  We Had To Wait Over 10 Minutes For A Table For Breakfast Whilst Tables Were Relaid (9.30Am).  Service Was Poor - No Butter Or Marmalade Arrived  So After About 10Minutes  We Got Up To Ask For Some.  It Was Not Made Clear That Only Scrambled Eggs Were Available On The Buffet  So My Breakfast Of Fried Eggs And Bacon Came Much Later.,,,,,
,1041,No,,,,,
,1042,The Food In The Dining Room Was Excellent The Service Was Dreadful. Waiting Staff Were Unqualified For The Job And The Wine Came With The Wrong Courses And The White Was Too Warm Andthe Red Was Too Cold. Service Was Slow And Generally No Seem To Know What They Were Doing. As We Looked Around The Dining Room We Could See Other Guests Were Getting Fed Up With Waiting For Service. Breakfast Service  Was Much Better. The Staff Actually Knew What They Were Doing.,,,,,
,1043,Certainly Not Silver Service. Plates/Glasses Were Not Cleared  Wine Was Not Poured Or Offered To Be Poured During Our Meal. There Was No Check-Back On Our Food - Made Worse As We Had Both Ordered Steak. There Were Plenty Of Staff But Little Attention To Guests' Needs. Very Disappointed At Both Dinner And Breakfast Which Was Even Worse.,,,,,
,1047,Fantastic Homemade Oatmeal At Breakfast,,,,,
,1049,Breakfast Was Dry And Looked As Though It Had Been Kept Warm For To Long  Meat At The Wedding Dinner Was Hard To Cut  Which Is Understandable As It Was Pork Fillet Which Is Very Difficult To Serve Tender When Served Whole  Also Very Dry As Very Little Sauce.,,,,,
,1051,It  Would Have Made A Better Impression If One Of The Waiters Hadn't Had A Frayed Waistcoat At The Back And Smelt Rather Badly Of Body Odour.  None Of The Waiters Seemed To Know Which Side To Place The Food Or Take The Plates Away.,,,,,
,1053,Saturday Lunch Service Was Very Poor. Had To Wait Over Half An Hour For A Burger And A Prawn Salad. We Had To Chase The Chef To Get Fed.,,,,,
,1054,We Were Disappointed In The Breakfast Buffet Style. The Food Was Not Hot  And Could Not Be Eaten.,,,,,
,1055,Having Sampled The Breakfast Dining  Barbaque  Pizza And Private Dining For Our Group  The Food Quality And Presentation With The Service We Recieved From Staff In All The Dining Areas Was Excellent  The Staff Are A Credit To The Facility.,,,,,
,1056,Vegetarian Option Excellent,,,,,
,1063,Support For Vegetarians Was Poor  The Food Undercooked And Not Imaginative,,,,,
,1064,Felt We Had Value For Money With Travelzoo Offer. We Thought Menu And Drinks Overpriced.....Â£15 For A Gt And Lime And Soda Seemed Excessive. Chateaubriand Was Ok Not Exceptional! Breakfast Service Very Slow On Saturday Morning A Little Better On Sunday. ,,,,,
,1068,Bistro Service Was Slow And Not As Attentive As The Edwardian Grill Which Was Excellent,,,,,
,1070,In All Things You Must Go Better,,,,,
,1071,In General  The Food And Service Were Good.   I Was Disappointed That The Restaurants Made Little Effort To Recognize My Birthday. The Bistro Did Decorate The Table On Request From My Wife. The Grill Did Virtually Nothing Apart From The Manager Wishing Me Happy Birthday When I Arrived. It Would Have Been Nice For The Hotel To Provide A Birthday Cake As Has Been My Experience At Several Other Hotels.,,,,,
,1072,Sunday We Dined At The Castle Brasserie  With The Music To Loud And The Room Seemed Cold Andwith The Appalling Weather Very Unforgiving,,,,,
,1073,A Little Overwhelmed On Christmas Day Lunch Meant Service Was Very Slow  But We Still Enjoyed It.,,,,,
,1076,We Previously Ate In Your Restaurant In February With The 5 Course Taster Menu Which Was Excellent.  It Was Because Of This Experience That We Decided To Come Back. As This Was Our Second Visit In A Short Time  We Decided To Eat In The Bistro Which We Found Very Disappointing. The Number Of Choices Was Very Restricted And The One Main Dish We Both Wanted - Spaghetti Vongole - Was Not Available. As A Result We Would Find It Difficult To Recommend The Bistro But Would Highly Recommend The Main Restaurant.,,,,,
,1083,Staff Very Helpful And Friendly.,,,,,
,1086,We Were Going To Go Into The Edwardian Grill But Thought It Seemed Quiet And Lacked A Bit Of Atmostphere So Opted For The Bistro,,,,,
,1089,Waiting Staff Slightly Vague And Started Clearing Plates Before All Our Party Had Finished  Although There Was An Apology,,,,,
,1091,I Expected The Food To Be Of Higher Quality And Presentation Than I Experienced. The 'Wow' Factor Was Missing From The Starter & Main Course  Is The Secret In The Sauces?  To Me Serving The Main Course In A Bowl Is More Gastro Pub Than Top Class Restaurant.  Desserts Were Delicious Though And Met With Approval From All - And A Stunning Looking Cheese Board.  Breakfast Service Was Slow And Confused And My Locally Produced Bacon Overcooked.,,,,,
,1092,I Was Suprised To Be Given Are Bottle Of Muscadet From A Glass Water Bottle.It Looked As If The Wine Had Been Drawn Off From A Larger Bottle. Very Poor Presentation. My Wife Had Torbay Sole Which I Believe Was Around Â£27. It Was Overcooked. I Expect That At The Prices Charged For Meals That They Would Be Absolutely Perfect. At Breakfast My Poached Eggs Were Served On A Very Wet Square Piece Of Bread.This Is Basic Stuff!,,,,,
,1093,The Meal Was Average And Definately Not Value For Money.,,,,,
,1094,Old Fashioned,,,,,
,1098,As We Were Unable To Enjoy Our Evening Meal Due To Having To Leave The Hotel Early For An Urgent Hospitalisation  We Can Only Comment On The Breakfast Provided Which Was Not The Usual Standard One Is Used To From A 5 Star Hotel.,,,,,
,1099,Quality And Variety Of Breads And Pastries Were Excellent. The Cheese Board Was An Absolute Delight. Breakfast Buffet Was Also Excellent. For Ourselves The Food Was Too Salty. The Cream Tea Was Out Of This World!,,,,,
,1100,We Attended A Wedding So The Afternoon Meal Was The Wedding Breakfast Service And Ambiance Was Excellelnt The Food Was Quite Imaginative   We Are Small Eaters But Did Find The Portion Sizes Extremely Small And The Lack Of Carbohydrate With The Main Meal Was Surprising And Just A Few Mini Greens With The Main Course Was Dissapointing  However We Did Love The Castle And Its Staff And Were Very Happy With All Other Areas Of Our Stay,,,,,
,1102,The Food Was Good But Not Outstanding. There Was A Distinct Lack Of Vegetables With The Main Course And When We Queried This At The End Of The Meal We Were Advised That Had We Asked Some Veg Would Have Been Brought. Since There Was No Indication Of This On The Menu The Thought Did Not Occur To Us. The Cheese Souffle Starter Was Poor But The Banana Dessert More Than Made Up For It And The Cheeseboard Was Excellent. The Staff Were At All Times Exemplary.,,,,,
,1103,I Am Gluten Free And There Was Gluten Somewhere In My Meal Which I Had A Bad Reaction To.,,,,,
,1105,No,,,,,
,1106,We Felt That Some Of The Waiting Staff Were Inexperienced Both At Dinner And Breakfast.,,,,,
,1107,We Ate In The Edwardian Grill  The Atmosphere Was Very 'Stiff' Chairs Are Uncomfortable As Seats Are Very Low For The Table. Waiter Was Very 'Stuffy' With An Attitude. Two Of The Steaks Filets  Were Excellent  Rib Eye Was Terrible  Worst Steak I Have Ever Eaten. Prices Were High  Salads Small  Not What I Would Call An Excellent Meal. We Ate In The Bistro A Few Times  Overall Fish And Chips Good  Steak Not So Good. Large Hair Ball In The Salad  Not Very Good At All.,,,,,
,1108,Service Was Very Slowat Times And Some Staff Were Unsure Of What We Had Ordered (On Two Occassions Our Food Was Not Presented Together As The Orders Were Wrong),,,,,
,1114,Just One Thing - An Observation Really - When We Came Down To Relax And Have A Drink Before Dinner  Several Coffee Tables - In Different Rooms - Were Still Covered In Used Afternoon Tea Things - Inconvenient And Not Attractive. The Cushions On The Sofas And Chairs Had Been 'Plumped Up' So Obviously A Member Of Staff Had Been In And Not Thought It Imperative To Clear Them Straight Away. I'd Rather Have A Cleared Room Than Perfect Cushions!,,,,,
,1115,The Dining Room Is A Lovely Setting And We Enjoyed Our Evening.,,,,,
,1119,The Food In The Main Restaurant Was Nothing Exceptional Considering The Price And Was Of An Ok Standard And We Wouldn't Eat There Again. The Selection At Breakfast Wasn't Great And The Presentation Was Uninviting And Not Of Good Quality. The Food In The Bistro Was Good.,,,,,
,1123,Please Inform Your Head Waiter  That He May Not Listen Into Nor Add To Private Conversations Of Your Diners  Even When He Has Only Two Tables On Which To Wait!,,,,,
,1126,Very Good Food But Poor Service In The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,1128,The Wine List Was A Bit Narrow For The Scale And Style Of The Hotel I Think  And Not Necessarily Nthe Best Value. So Not Bad But Not Excellent.,,,,,
,1131,The Staff In The Edwardian Grill Were Slow And Not Very Engaging Our First Evening. After Waiting A While For Service (We Were The Only Table At 7:00) We Called Over The Maitre'd And Asked Him To Take Our Drink Order Because The Only Waiter Began To Wait On Two Tables That Came In After Us. Rather Than Apologizing He Explained That The Other Tables That Came In After Us Were Coming From The Bar So They Were Already Waiting On Them - Really Couldn't Understand Why That Was Relevant. On The Other Hand The Food Was Quite Good For Dinner. Engagement With Staff Is A Critical Part Of Enjoying A Dining Experience And You May Want To Consider Some Additional Training In This Area. We Ate Two Or Three Times In The Bistro And Staff Were Friendlier And More Attentive.,,,,,
,1132,The Tea Which Was Served To Us At Breakfast Time Was Extremely Weak - Fortunately We Had Brought Our Own Teabags With Us.,,,,,
,1133,Looked After By Bobinsky Who  Along With The Rest Of The Dining Staff  Was Superb,,,,,
,1134,The Restaurant Was Cold At Dinner.,,,,,
,1136,Bistro And Room Service Lunch Were Poor Quality.Grill Was Excellent If Expensive.,,,,,
,1139,Poor Experience In The Bistro When Our Mussels Were Served Almost Cold And With No Sauce. The Dish Should Have Been Checked By The Waiter Before Serving. After A Wait We Eventually Were Served With A Decent Plate Of Mussels. It Would Have Been Nice If A Gesture Such As A Complimentary Glass Of Wine Were Given.,,,,,
,1145,Surprised By Restricted Menu Choice,,,,,
,1148,We Were Very Impressed With The Way The Wedding Party Was Catered For  With Optimum Use Made Of Your Function Areas  And The Speed With Which The Staff Re-Organised Each Room According The Need.,,,,,
,1152,Breakfast When Ordering Extras The Service Was Poor  For Instances Poach Eggs Were Coming Up Hard Boiled And Took A Long Time Arreving.,,,,,
,1153,Bistro Was Good For Informal Family Dining And Mulberry Room Excellent For The 8 Of Us But See Later Comments,,,,,
,1155,Very Good Meal....Starter Excellent  Main Course Spoilt By The Fact That The Very Good Lamb Was Encircled By  Something That Was Impossible To Cut With The Knife We Were Given  Your Staff Produced Steak Knives.Sweet Very Good. Would Have Ticked Excellent If It Had Not Been For The Main Course. Staff Were Very Pleasent And Looked After Us Very Well In A Very Easy And Nice Way.,,,,,
,1156,No. Everything Was Perfect.,,,,,
,1162,Bistro Menu Limited If You Wanted A Snack. Dining Room Lacked Ambiance.       Not Sure The Carpet Was Vacuumed During Our Whole Stay.    Particularly Noticeable Monday A.M. At Breakfast.,,,,,
,1164,A Long Wait In The Edwardian Grill  But The Food Was Fine.,,,,,
,1167,The G&T's Were Eye-Wateringly Expensive!,,,,,
,1169,As I Explained Above The Service Is Very Slow. One Waiter - New Perhaps And Not Adequately Trained - Consistently Made Mistakes With Our Orders.,,,,,
,1170,We Had A Snack When Arriving And We Were Made Very Welcome.  In The Evening We Returned To The Castle Bistro And Had An Excellent Dinner. The Waitress Was Very Pleasant.,,,,,
,1173,We Were Very Disappointed With The Bistro. It Is Difficult To Eat Elsewhere With Young Children But On Both Saturday And Sunday (6 Adults And 2 Children) The Food And Service Were Dreadful - Such A Shame After We Enjoyed It Last Year. We Ate Out Monday  Tuesday And Wednesday. Thursday We Tried Again And Both The Food And Service Were Good  Friday Was Terrible Again. The Staff Were Pleasant But There Were Not Enough Of Them. Frederico Was In The Bistro But  Unfortunately  He Didn't Approach Our Table And I Didn't Want To Make A Fuss And Spoil The Holiday For My Children And Grandchildren So I Did Not Complain But What A Shame ..,,,,,
,1175,Dining Staff Were Kind And Friendly  But  The Chef Let Them All Down By Producing An Unimaginative Menu And Uninteresting Food.  Breakfast Was Acceptable Though.,,,,,
,1180,We Were Grateful That Federico Arranged For Us To Dine At 6.30Pm,,,,,
,1182,Integrated Dinner/Dance - Golf,,,,,
,1183,We Would Have Liked To Have Tried The Afternoon Tea  But Unfortunately Did Not Have Time,,,,,
,1184,Just Ate Breakfast And Planned Group Meals There...The Staff Was Great  Just Seemed You Were Short Of Enough Staff To Make It Smoother Ate Once In The Bistro...That Was Very Nice And Friendly  Like The Choices. Had Tea In The Bar Which Was Very Cozy And A Quiet Place To Visit.,,,,,
,1185,Didn't Have The Wine I Ordered. House Wine Recommended Was Good However We Both Had The Same Fishy Starter - Tastless. The Waiter Was Advised That The Combination On The Plate Didn't Work   But He Didn't Appear Interested.  We Both Ordered Steaks. They Looked Good  But Had Little Flavour.  We Would Have Been So Disspointed If It Was A Special Occassion.    We Both Had Steaks - Looked Good  But Tasteless.,,,,,
,1189,You Seem To Have Changed The Chef Since Our Last Disastrous Dining Experience At Christmas Two Years Ago And The New Man Seems Excellent! Thanks,,,,,
,1191,The Menu Did Not Make My Mouth Water And Seemed A Little Over Fussy Apart From The Steaks.  A Few More Familiar Choices On The Menu Would Be Appreciated But Possibly I Am Not One Who Appreciates A 'Dining Experience' Rather Than An Excellent Meal.,,,,,
,1194,The Two Small Dining Rooms That I Had The Misfortune To Be Placed In Were Dreary In The Extreme With Their Dark Rust And Black Walls  The Carpets Were Covered In Stains  The Wallpaper Either Coming Off Or Knocked Off The Walls. Although The Staff  As People Were Polite And Obliging The Fact That I Booked A Table At 7.30 I Finally Was Served With My Main Course At 9.10 After Complaint Although The Starter Had Not Been Cooked In The That I Had Requested  This Did Not Happen The Second Evening As I Issued A Serious Warning. At Breakfast As Described By Another Of Your Guests The Staff Were Running Around Like Headless Chickens With Tea Arriving Half Way Through Breakfast And Cooked Dishes Arriving Before Serials Had Been Finished. The Table Joints Were So Loose That The Table Moved  6 Inches In Each Direction. The Majority Of Guests Including Myself Were Asking For Cushions To Sit On So That They Could Sit At The Correct Level For The Table. All Of These Observations I Pointed Out To Your Hotel Manager.  ,,,,,
,1195,The Staff Were Excellent But I Have Put Fair Overall Because I Strongly Dislike Have The Same Menu Presented Night After Night. I Would Certainly Not Want To Stay For More Than 3/4 Nights  Because You Would Run  Out Of Agreeable Options.   Also We Thought The Dessert Menu Was Too Strongly Weighted To Chocolate Items.,,,,,
,1196,Eating In The Library Was A Treat - We Loved It.,,,,,
,1201,The Bistro Dinner We Had On The First Night Was Not Particularly Good And The Overall Service Was Quite Poor. One Pudding Arriving 15 Minutes After The First And So On. Edwardian Grill Experience Was Very Good. Casual But Attentive Service And So On.,,,,,
,1203,We Found The Edwardian Grill Somewhat Disappointing.  Service Excellent  Selection Lacked Inspiration. The Castle Bistro Was Excellent.   Oak Bar Very Good.  Selection Superb  And Very Professional,,,,,
,1204,The Food Was Excellent,,,,,
,1205,Whilst The Waiters And Waitresses Were Good  The Speed Of Service Was Painfully Slow. 15 Minutes Between Starter And Main Courses. Also Whilst Very Friendly Service In Bar  Again The Speed Of Service Was Far To Slow,,,,,
,1206,The Bacon Although Quality Was Tough To Cut,,,,,
,1207,Not Convinced By Edwardian Grill - Food Good But Service Patchy For The Prices - Very Friendly But Not Really That Efficient - Waiting Over An Houir For Main Despite Son Being Served With His Meal  But Wehn We Mentioned It To Adam Was Then Ahndled Well By The Manager.  Rest Of Food Experieve Excellent,,,,,
,1209,The Service In Both The Edwardian And The Bistro Was Fantastic!  They Were All Incredibly Patient  Professional And Amazing!  Thank You!  People In Particular Who Were So Amazing In Their Service Were (In The Edwardian) Pawel  Hannah  Asha  And Emma. In The Bistro  The Team Was Fantastic With Becca  Caroline  Simon  Elizabeth And Sam Serving With A Smile And Incredible Professionalism. Thank You All!,,,,,
,1211,Service Was Very Slow In All Aspects Of The Dining Experience; Both Dinner And Breakfast.,,,,,
,1215,This Is Your Week Link The Floors Were Always Dirty Ans Coverd In Food Scraps. The Waiters Need Better Training And Need To Improve On Their English. There Is A Problem Between The Kitchen And The Waiters  The Food Seems To Be Plated Up Very Quickly And Then The Waiters Leave It Under The Lamp For 3 To 5 Mins. My Soup Had A Skin On It. The Tea And Coffee Was Always Luke Warm And The Toast Was Under Done Every Day Except Today. The Waiters In The Main Dinning Room Are Well Below Standard.,,,,,
,1219,Absolutely Impeccable Food  Service And Drinks Were All Amazing.,,,,,
,1226,Faantastic Food  Exceptional Quality.,,,,,
,1228,The Cheese Board Was Stunning!!!,,,,,
,1230,Our Breakfast Order Was Forgotten On The First Morning Of Our Stay  Leaving Us Late For Spa Appointment.,,,,,
,1231,Bistro Seemed To Struggle A Bit When Full  Service Slowed Down  Items Were Forgotten And Quality Struggled A Little.,,,,,
,1236,Again The Staff In The Edwardian Grill Were Attentive Without Being Intrusive.  Congrats To The Restaurant Manager And To The Sommelier Who Were Particularly Helpful.,,,,,
,1238,The 2 Restaurants Were Chalk And Cheese. The Edwardian Grill - Divine Atmosphere  Attentive Staff  Beautiful Food And Service. The Castle Bistro - Food On Carpet  No Serviettes Provided ( I Fetched My Own )  Non Attentive  Or Knowledgeable Staff ( Dijon Mustard Isn't Wholegrain....) With Attitude  ( Exception The Manager - Very Friendly And Driven )  Terrible Overcooked Food - Steak Red On One Side Brown On Other - Didn't Look Like A Prime Cut T-Bone But A Microwaved Bad Take Away. Sole Swimming In Butter - Inedible - So Asked For New Plate So I Could Taste The Fish. Prawn Cocktail Starter - Tasty Though. Wine From Edwardian Grill - Sent Down Earlier In Day ( Held Over From Previous Night) Took An Age To Find - Though Charlotte Had Organised This Earlier For Us.Sloppy Looking Cooks Going Into The Kitchen - Not Aware Of Anything.... Chalk Board Sloppy Writ Tine And Bad Spelling - Atmosphere - Terrible - Bad Airport Lounge.No Flowers  Soft Furnishings...I Could Go On And On.....Whole Experience Left A Complete Dampener On What Had  Until Then  Been A Very Pleasant Easter Day  ,,,,,
,1240,After The Sole Main Course My Wife Had To Go Back To The Room And Was Sick And Quite Poorly. She's Never Been Sick Before After Fish. This Was Reported To The Manager Who Was Very Helpful.,,,,,
,1241,The Staff  Yet Again  Were Incredibly Attentive And Very Professional. We Had A Really Wonderful Evening And Were Blown Away By The Quality Of The Food And Dining Experience.,,,,,
,1245,Brilliant!,,,,,
,1246,Could Not Fault Any Aspect Food And Service Was Exceptional,,,,,
,1247,I Wish It Would Stay Open Even A Little Later  But The Food Was Good As Was The Service.,,,,,
,1249,I Have Only Rated The Service In The Edwardian Grill  The Service In The Bistro Was Nothing Like As Good  Nor Was The Food  Although The Edwardian Grill Was Expensive It Was So Much Better Than Most Other Restaurants That I Would Not Only Rate It As Very Good  But Also Consider It Value For Money.  The Bistro Was  In Comparison  Very Disappointing  And Also Disappointing Compared With Other Similar Dining Venues - Certainly Not Better,,,,,
,1250,On Both Evenings  In The Edwardian Grill  All Our Meals Were Let Down By The Quality Of The Main Courses.  The Pizzas In The Bistro Were Excellent.,,,,,
,1251,The Bistro Was A Little Disappointing  Having To Wait 20 Minutes For A Glass Of Wine To Arrive When There Were Only Ourselves And A Table Of 3 In The Room,,,,,
,1253,Federico Kindly Allocated Us  Dining Rooms Which Worked Well For Us With A Nine Week Old Baby And Did Not Of Course Disturb Other Guests Dining Experiences Laurent Adopted The Family And Was Very Attentive And Sharp In Service  Good Dry Sense Of Humour The Sommelier Gave Us A Reccd Of A Lebanon Wine Whic Was Excellent Federico Kept A Quiet Eye On Things In A Very Discreet Way He Was Clearly Making Sure We Had A Very Special Stay,,,,,
,1254,The Edwardian Grill Could Be Of A Higher Standard For The 'Flagship' Restuarant.,,,,,
,1255,I'm Looking Forward To Trying The Edwardian Grill On My Next Stay,,,,,
,1256,I Think We Were The Only People Dinning The Night We Were In The Edwardian  So It Was A Little Quiet But The Staff Were Great And Provided Some Entertaining Conversation.  We Particularly Enjoyed The Oak Bar  Eating There On Our Second Night Was Particularly Enjoyable.,,,,,
,1258,In Complete Contrast Whilst In The Bistro The Service Was Very Good But The Food Left A Vast Amount To Be Desired. I Discussed These Concerns On The Night And Was Offered Other Food But The 2 Dishes Were So Poor I Refused. The Homemade Chutney Was Vile Too Much Cinnamon Which Overpowered Whole Dish Destroying The Delicate Meats Of The Antipasti. Fish Main (Cod) Was Missing Peas Which I Had To Request  The Fish Was Over Cooked And Hard But Most Importantly So Oily I Spent The Remainder Of The Night Vomiting. Reception Kindly Reimbursed The Cost Of The Meals. Shame As The Edwardian Grill Couldn't Be More Different. I Kindly Suggest The Kitchen Staff Undergo Some Serious Training And Evaluate What Standard Of Food They Are Willing To Serve. May I Finally Suggest Sourcing Chutneys From A Local Supplier Such As Joshua's Mediterranean Chutney.,,,,,
,1260,The Staff Is Not Perfect But The Food Is Delicious And When We Stay In Your Hotel Again We Will Definitely Dine There Every Day. Actually  The Staff In The Edwardian Grill Is Not Too Bad  Some Of Them Should Improve Their English  But The Staff In The Castle Bistro Are Not Able To Understand Common English Phrases (Some Of Them).,,,,,
,1265,Waiters Were Perfect And Attentive  The Food Also Perfect,,,,,
,1266,The Dining Room Decor Could Do With A Little Thought  Curtains Might Be Nice. The Staff Were All Superbly Efficient. Each Of Our Dining Experiences Was An Absolute Delight And We Look Forward To Dining In The Edwardian Grill Again Soon.,,,,,
,1267,Much Improved From Last Year,,,,,
,1270,Great Food And Informal Family Dinning,,,,,
,1272,The Champagne Afternoon Tea Was Lovely (My Partner Though Would Have Preferred Fewer Cakes And More Sandwiches!) But The Edwardian Grill Evening Meal Was Unsurpassed. I Have Never Had A Beef Wellington Or A Cheeseboard Like It!,,,,,
,1273,It's Simply Splendid,,,,,
,1274,The Cheese Selection Was Totes Amaze,,,,,
,1275,Service Not Quite As Fabulous As In The Rest Of The Hotel.  Had To Ask For Ordered Food  Cutlery And Overcharged By 2 Meals....  However  Accept That Mistakes Can Happen.,,,,,
,1276,Fantastic. Seasonal & Local Produce To A Very High Standard. Great Service.,,,,,
,1277,The Table Was Not Clean.,,,,,
,1278,My Ratings Are For The Grill And Bar.  I Thought The Food In The Bistro Was Not Of The Same High Standard Ad So Did Not Represent Value For Money,,,,,
,1280,We Were Planning To Eat In The Edwardian Grill  However We Had A Fabulous Champagne Cream Tea In The Afternoon And Felt A Lighter Dinner In The Bistro Suited Us Better. We Are Very Much Looking Forward To Dining In The Edwardian Grill On Our Next Visit.,,,,,
,1281,We Had Our Best Xmas Party Yet! I Had A Really Good Time. The Food Was Excellent And Your Staff Very Helpful. I Am Going To Recommend Your Xmas Parties To All My Friends.,,,,,
,1284,As First Time Guests  A More Thorough Explanation As To The Style Of Dining  Edwardian Or Bistro  Would Have Better Informed Us As To Which To Choose. We Would In Hindsight Have Chosen Edwardian With A More Thorough Description Of Menu  Dress Code Etc.,,,,,
,1285,A Small Thing Please Could You Supply Sugar Tongs With The Servings Of Tea And Coffee As The Cube Sugar Did Have A Tendency To Escape And A Superior Establishment Such As Yours  Prides Itself Of Service Therefore This Would Be A Smalll But Useful Addition,,,,,
,1286,Slow Service In Bistro,,,,,
,1288,The Only Reason I Gave The Food A 'Fair' Marking Is Due To The Fillet Steak I Ordered Being Burnt When I Asked For It Medium / Well. It Ws Very Over Cooked. We Also Found The Breakfast To Be Cold And The Breakfast We Ordered From The Menu Was A Little Underwhelming For The Price.,,,,,
,1289,Again  The Food Was Delicious And To A Very High Standard. This Is One Of The Main Areas I Have Been Telling People When Recommending Bovey Castle. Even Though There Were Quite A Lot Of Us The Food Was Excellent Quality.,,,,,
,1291,As Above,,,,,
,1292,Food Was Fantastic Overall  Although Breakfast Buffet Was Slightly Dissapointing In Comparison.,,,,,
,1293,Very Friendly Service  However The Food Was Slow  And Slightly Cold.,,,,,
,1294,The Menu In The Castle Bistro Was Not As Good As We Would Have Hoped (The Pub In North Bovey Had A Better Menu!) But The Food Was Cooked Very Well In All Restaraunts  And The Afternoon Tea Was Great. Also I Would Like To Thank The Chef Again For Such A Nice Birthday Cake!,,,,,
,1296,It Is Lovely To Have The Contrast Of The Two Very Different Dining Areas Within The Castle  Both Very High Quality Food And Service,,,,,
,1299,The Meal At The Wedding Was Of Excellent Quality And Beautifully Presented And Served.,,,,,
,1300,Starters Excellent. Chauteaubriand Was Slightly Overcooked And Not Enough Jus Given The Amount Of Meat. Pudding And Wine Lovely.  Cheese Board Excellent. A Jug Of Water Should Be Offered As Standard Along With Mineral Water. Breakfast Was Disappointing  Pot Of Tea Was Not Hot Enough  Egg Shell In Eggs Benedict And One Egg Was Not Cooked Enough So Watery Liquid Spurted All Over The Plate Of Food.  Scrambled Egg Was Bland And Overcooked. Drinks In The Bar Were Excellent.,,,,,
,1301,Portions A Little Small,,,,,
,1303,Service Was Very Slow On Several Occasions. We Had To Cancel Part Of Our Lunch Because Of This And No One Seemed To Care.,,,,,
,1304,Discussing With My Wife During The Meal  We Both Said The Quality Of Food And Service Was Excellent So Top Marks To The Chef And The Rest Of The Team  Considering The Executive Chef Wasn't Working On The Sunday Night  I Couldn't Really See How Much Better The Food Nor Service Would Have Been. 'Very Impressed'.,,,,,
,1307,The Menu In The Bistro Should Vary From Lunch To Evening With More Choice,,,,,
,1308,The Chef And The Manager Organised A Private Menu  Which Was Outstanding And We All Had A Fantastic Evening Of Celebration.,,,,,
,1310,The Pace Of Dinner Service In Particular Could Be Improved  Especially As Service Is Added To Your Bill.,,,,,
,1311,The Edwardian Grill Was Fabulous. The Castle Bistro Was Quite Noisy - Background Music Plus Children And Larger Groups Of People (And This Was A Tuesday Evening),,,,,
,1313,Best Beef Ever,,,,,
,1314,Excellent Fresh Food. The Children's Food Was Most Impressive. Our Young Daughter Polished Off Her Meals At Every Sitting.,,,,,
,1315,We Thought The Bistro Menu Was Quite Boring And I Think There Should Be A Greater Amount Of Choices Available.  We Were Staying For Five Nights And Went To A Local Pub For Supper On One Occasion.  We Would Also Have Gone To The Pub On The Last Night Had The Manager Not Asked Us For A Drink In The Oak Bar At 7 O'clock ~ Clever!  We Loved Sitting On The Bistro Terrace Though Well In To The Evenings.,,,,,
,1316,The Restaurant On Saturday Was Half Full But The Main Course Took For Ever To Arrive Once The Starters Had Been Cleared Away - We Did Have A Word With The Waiter And He Chased Up Our Meal As We Had A Baby Sitter Covering For Us,,,,,
,1320,Excellent In Almost All Respects. Chipped Glasses On The Table And One Or Two Other Minor Aspects Betrayed A Lack Of Attention To Detail On Some Levels.,,,,,
,1322,Dining At Bovey Castle Is Always A Fantastic Experience And We Loved Every Minute Of It,,,,,
,1323,Best Beef Ever!,,,,,
,1324,Excellent  We Are Used To The Local Chippie !!! Lol,,,,,
,1329,The Dinner Far Exceeded Our Expectations! We Stayed At Bovey As We Were Dining At Gidliegh Park The Following Day. If We Had Known How Amazing The Meal At Bovey Would Be  We Would Have Stayed Longer  Icing On The Cake Of A Wonderful Stay!,,,,,
,1331,Lovely There Were Not Many Guests So Dining Room Was Perhaps Some Heating And Some Music?,,,,,
,1333,We Ate In The Bistro Which Was A Lovely Atmosphere However The Food Was Only Average,,,,,
,1335,Guests Staying At Hotel Should Be Made Perhaps More Aware Of The Completely Different Nature/Formalities Of The Bistro And The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,1340,The Hot Breakfast Was Not Very Good But The Continental Was Nice,,,,,
,1341,My Husband And I Both Chose Steak As Our Main Course. My Husbands Rib Was Fine But My Sirloin Was Very Disappointing  Chewy & Tough. I Was Offered A Replacement But I Was Quite Full & My Husbands Meal Was Nearly Finished.,,,,,
,1342,The Food At Bovey Was Fantastic,,,,,
,1343,Service Was Good If A Bit Slow.  My Second Glass Of Wine Order Was Made Pre Dessert But Did Not Arrive Til Dessert Was Finished And I Had To Ask Its Whereabouts.  Apologies Were Made And I Was Told It Was Deducted From The Bill. It Was Not.  Breakfast I Enquired About Vegetarian Full Breakfast.  First Time I Was Told There Were No Vegetarian Sausages  Second Time I Was Told There Were Vegetarian Sausages Only For The Plate To Arrive Minus The Vegetarian Sausage. A Little Disappointing As I Did Not Want The Breakfast Without The Vegetarian Sausage And Had To Send The One On Second Morning Back And Make Replacement Order.,,,,,
,1346,We Didn't Feel The Quality Of Fine Dining Was Up To Gidleigh Park Standard  But There Was A Nice Atmosphere In The Candlelit Dining Room And Staff Were Very Friendly.  Service Between Courses Was A Bit Slow - Ok For Just The Two Of Us  But Would Have Been Too Slow If Our Young Son Had Been With Us,,,,,
,1348,Dress Code Should Be Kept A Eye On The American On Table Next To Us Had A Round Neck Jumper On We Did Feel Let Down With This .,,,,,
,1350,Wonderful Ambience In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,1351,The Service In The Edwardian Grill Was Slow On The Friday Night And At Breakfast. I Had To Ask If We Had Been Forgotten As Our Starter Was A Long Time Coming. I Had The Haddock For Breakfast And Again Was Slow To Arrive On The Saturday Morning. However The Staff Were Very Polite And The Food Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1353,It Was Perfect,,,,,
,1357,None  It Exceeded Our Expectations,,,,,
,1360,The Bistro Was Perfect For The Children And The Sunday Lunch In The Edwardian Grill Was Lovely & The Children Were Looked After And Made To Feel Welcome In There.,,,,,
,1361,Very Good Staff  Very Helpful And Attentive.,,,,,
,1362,Tables Are Nicely Spaced And The Food Delicious.  Excellent Wine.  Bread Was Superb With A Fantastic Choice.  Very Enjoyable Dining Experience.,,,,,
,1365,Overall Beautiful - Both Bar And Restaurant.  The Manager Gave Us A Glass Of Champagne (Our Break Did Not Start To Well With Us Breaking Down En Route) - Nice Touch Which Was Most Appreciated!,,,,,
,1366,Just Amazing!,,,,,
,1367,When We Arrived  Left Our Room And Went To The Cathedral Room To Enjoy A Coffee And The Ambience.  I Waited For 40 Minutes For Someone To Take Our Order  Then Another 35 Mins For A Baileys Coffee Which Was Cold And The Cream Had Sunk! Also They Forgot My Husbands Coffee  He Was Cross As He Wanted To Walk Around The Grounds Before It Had Gotten Dark As We Had Come A Long Way And Only Had One Night. It Was Our First Time To Be Away Without The Children In Years For Our Anniversary. In The Morning Our Breakfast Things Were Not Cleared Away After Our Fruit Courses And Hot Courses. I Do However Have To Say That Apart From That The Staff Were All V Friendly Accomodating And Keen For Us To Enjoy Ourselves Which Made Up For The Wait The Day Before And The Dish Clearing In The Morning. The Girl In The Breakfast Room Took Our Order But Seemed V Nervous! She Was Polite And When My Husband Asked To Have Some Pudding As There Was None On The Buffet She Obliged Very Efficiently!!,,,,,
,1369,The Service In The Oak Bar At Lunch Time Was Very Slow  With No Waiters To Be Found For Quite Long Periods Of Time. The Atmosphere In The Edwardian Grill Was A Little Lacking.  The Food Was Enjoyable But Not Amazing - The Burger Was Not Worth Â£30.00.  The Waither Had Little Knowledge Of The Cheese Selection.,,,,,
,1370,The Meat Was Not A High Enough Standard For The Cost.  The Fish  However  Was Very Good. Your Chef Needs To Make Some Improvements To Warrant The High Cost Of Eating In The Edwardian Grill. The Breakfast Was Not Good Enough Either.,,,,,
,1371,You Charged Â£47 For A Child's Meal.  Also You Served Me Almonds When I Informed You Prior To My Arrival I Have An Allergy Fortunate I Spoted It. Disapointed The Waiter Went And Checked That L Had Notified The Hotel Came Back And Said Sorry. I Was Charged For All The Meal And A Service Charge. Noted That The Hotel Manager Was Very Good In Checking Up On Me When Ever We Meet Which Was Well Received.,,,,,
,1372,It Would Be Good If You Advertised The 'No Denim' Dress Code For Some Of The Restaurants Clearly On The Website Or Confirmation  Then I Would Have Brought Appropriate Trousers,,,,,
,1374,The Service In The Edwardian Grill Was Superb: Correct  Attentive And An Appropriate Level Of Formality.  The Staff Were All Knowledgeable About Their Particular Areas.,,,,,
,1375,My Husband Said  It Was The Best Meal He Had Ever Had In The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,1376,Highly Recommended  Would Have Been Nice To See A Game Dish On Menu. Even If Farmed Animals Used. Just My Passion  But I'm Sure It Would Go Down Well With Many Visitors.,,,,,
,1378,Excellent,,,,,
,1379,The Hotel Dining Room Was Very Quiet - So Not Much Atmosphere. The Food (Steak & Chips) Was Only Of Good Pub Quality  Not Fine Dining & Certainly Did Not Justify The High Price. The Menu Was Strange - Steak Or Fish  But No Chicken  Pork Or Lamb. On The Second Night We Ate Outside The Hotel.,,,,,
,1381,The Choice Of Food And Quality Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1384,Fantastic Dining Every Time,,,,,
,1388,Excellent. Can't Wait To Dine There Again.,,,,,
,1389,It's Really Beautiful And I Loved The Pianist  He Played Beautifully  It Really Set The Scene. Amazing!!,,,,,
,1390,Castle Bistro Service Was Poor  Quality Of Food Also Poor. Edwardian Grill Food & Service Was Excellent  However 2Nd Night We Had To Dine In A Side Room As The Main Restaurant Had Been Booked Out.  Would Have Liked To Have Known This In Advance.  Staff In Oak Bar Excellent,,,,,
,1391,Just A Small Comment  Would Have Preferred Offers Of More Coffee At The End Of The Meal. Felt That My Request To Have My Coffee Cup Filled To Top As Only Have Black  Was A Problem  The Waiter Seemed A Little Irritated  But Not A Big Problem,,,,,
,1392,Food Not Up To Scratch !,,,,,
,1393,Restaurant A Little Well Worn  But Staff Excellent - Friendly & Efficient But Not Over Gushing Or Pushy! Bistro Unexpectedly Refreshing Offering A Completely Modern Twist! Even Though On The 3 Occasions We Requested Specific Times We Were Offered Alternatives Even Though You Were No Where Near Fully Booked - Just A Bit Of A Niggle!!,,,,,
,1405,Overall  The Service Was Very Slow.  On The First Night We Dined At The Edwardian Grill  Except We Were Actually In A Small Room To The Side As There Was A Large Function On In The Grill Room.  The Service Was So Slow That Although We Had Booked A Table For 8Pm We Did Not Get Our Main Course Until 10.45. The Steak And Sauce Were Cold So We Asked For Some More Sauce Which Arrived Cold Aswell  Although They Were In Little Saucepans.  We Did Complain And Received Desserts On The House Which Was Really Nice But By Then It Was Too Late At Night For Us To Enjoy Any Further Food.  I Am Not Sure Either Whether It Is Policy For Us To Pour Our Own Wine Which We Did For Every Bottle That We Had  After The First Glass. We Ate At The Bistro The Following Night And It Was Very Much Better.  Hot Food And Fast Service Although Again  We Poured Our Own Wine.,,,,,
,1406,We Also Ate In The Castle Bistro. Although The Food Was Good Quality  The Service Level Was Not As Good As The Rest Of The Hotel. Slow To Order And We Were Not Offered The Drink Or Desert That Formed Part Of The Children's Menu.,,,,,
,1408,Dinner Was Great But I Was Very Disappoint With The Duck Egg And Truffle For Breakfast As I Got One Egg On A Plate And No Truffle Shavings.,,,,,
,1410,As Usual A Relaxing And Warm Atmosphere With Impeccable Service.,,,,,
,1412,Staff Were You Pro And Lets Not For Get Mr Lego Man1,,,,,
,1413,The Bistro Was Not Relaxing Felt More Like A Motorway Restauent,,,,,
,1414,The Edwardian Grill - Breakfast Via Self-Service : Some ' Cooked ' Items Only Moderately Warm !                                Dinner Service - Food Excellent  Slight Delay Between Starter & Main Castle Bistro           - Disappointment In Menu Non-Availability # Addressed Personally By Federico,,,,,
,1415,Slightly Bigger Portions Would Be Nice  More Ambience Needed In The Dining Room,,,,,
,1418,The Whole Experience Was Fabulous. Speaking Swahili With Samual Was An Added Bonus. ( Wish It Could Have Been Longer ),,,,,
,1420,The Quality Of The Food And The Restaurant Is Not The Same Level As The Hotel.,,,,,
,1423,We Brought Family Down Who Were Also Very Well Catered For.  Just An Amazing Experience,,,,,
,1426,The Food Was Amazing And Was One Of The Highlights Of Our Stay.  Our Only Comment Would Be That The Menu Did Not Change At All During Our Three Night Stay And If We Had Of Stayed Longer It Would Have Been Hard To Have Chosen Anything Different If You Don't Like Fish Or Goats Cheese For Example.  Maybe  Having One Or Two Specials Might Be A Great Addition.  We Did Hear Other Guests Also Commentating And They Found It Difficult As They Didn't Like Beef.,,,,,
,1427,The Torbay Sole Was To Die For!,,,,,
,1428,Food And Service Excellent Both Dining Rooms Were Very Comfortable  But We Enjoyed The Grill The Most.,,,,,
,1429,The Lodge Service Dining Was Amazing...The Best Need We Have Ever Tasted,,,,,
,1432,Would Have Liked To See More Variety On Edwardian Grill Menu. Also Felt It Was Overpriced.,,,,,
,1433,We Really Enjoyed Dining At The Edwardian Grill. The Staff Were Excellent And The Food Was Fabulous. We Particularly Liked The Sea Salt And Rosemary Bread Rolls.,,,,,
,1435,Bistro - I Would Rate Food 'Fair' & Service 'Good'. Menu Was Very Limited. Prices High For The Quality Of The Food And Whats Available Locally Edwardian Grill - Service 'Very Poor'. Food 'Good'. Prices 'Fair' Oak Bar - Service Was 'Good' & Prices 'Fair' For This Type Of Hotel,,,,,
,1436,Excellent Food And Service,,,,,
,1440,4Th Time Eating Here & The Last! I Love Bovey Castle But You Need To Get A Better Chef! It Wasn't The Supplier If Meat Fed:  He'd Over Cooked It! Real Shame - We Will Be Back But Lessons Learnt Not To Eat Here. Everything Else Is Perfect - Service  Location  The Staff Attitude Etc So Thank You For That.,,,,,
,1443,Amazing Menu In The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,1444,Muddled Orders  Service Etc - This Area Has Slipped Since Our Last Visits. In The Evening  Shame That Noisiness And Presence Of Young Families Can Disrupt A Romantic Meal.  Absolutely Didn't Like Being Chased At Break Fast For The 'Cooked' Or  'Continental' Tick Box Waitress - This Needs To Be Addressed In A More Professional Way. We Are Paying Over Â£ 200 A Night And Felt Bit Chef & Brewer Mentality. For The Buffet Breakfast  Felt Disappointed That Was Charged Service For Very Mediocre Standards - I Crossed Them Off The Bill To Reflect This But They Still Appeared On The Final Bill.,,,,,
,1447,As Previously Noted.,,,,,
,1448,Some Waiters Are Very Skilled  Some Others Are Not.,,,,,
,1449,Staff Very Attentive And Welcoming. The Bistro And Oak Bar Staff Were Very Accommodating To Our Young Son.,,,,,
,1450,Didnt Keep In Theme With The Rest Of The Castle.  Disappointed With The Service- Inattentive Waiters  Everything Was Generally Very Slow  Staff Needed A Lot Of Prompting,,,,,
,1451,I Feel This Is The Area That We Were Most Disappointed With. The Presentation Was Nice But For Us The Taste Was Lacking In The Mains That We Had. I Think I Had The Potatoe And Truffle Pasta With Leeks - This Was Not Great! However The Pea Soup Was Lovely And The Dark Chocolate Pudding Was Nice. I Think You Need To Personally Try All Your Dishes Before Serving To The Public - For A 5 Star Quality Venue You Expect The Finest Food. Also On Our First Night We Were Served By One Of Your Waiters And He Had A Severe Body Odor Problem And It Was Very Off Putting When He Was Serving Our Food. It Smelt Of Underarm Sweat Very Bad!!,,,,,
,1452,The Service Was Excellent And You Did Not Have To Want For Anything.,,,,,
,1455,Yes We Booked Into The Bistro To Begin With   But We Found The Menu Very Limited   It Was Aimed Directly For Families With Children (Yet There Were No Children In There ). We Were Booked In For 7 O Clock But Changed This In The Day To 8 O Clock . This Was Not Passed Onto The Bistro And When We Arrived At 8 We Were Told By The Member Of Staff That We Were An Hour Late   Wasn't Too Impressed By Her . We Changed To The Edwardian Grill And Service And Food Were Beyond Perfect.,,,,,
,1457,Food Very Good But Service Extremely Patchy - Friendly But Not Very Efficient.  Edwardian Grill - Decor Could Be Improved  In Particular  The Sofas At The Entrance Look Very Odd - Aunty's Living Room Meets Cheap Hotel Foyer.  Food In Edwardian Grill Was Very Nice But Over Priced.  Breakfast Mediocre,,,,,
,1460,When Offering Champagne Don't Then Add The Gesture To The Bill. This Was Removed However When Queried And With A Smile.,,,,,
,1462,Lovely Food  Waiter Got Our Main Course Order Wrong But We Enjoyed All The Same So Felt No Need To Complain,,,,,
,1464,The Food Was Wonderful And The Service Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1465,Sadly We Don't Know His Name But The Cheese Waiter (Possibly German?) Was Fantastic - He Really Made Our Meal Experience Something That We Will Remember Forever! Other Than That The Food Was Fantastic  Service Was Great  Good Winelist And Vintage Port By The Glass Is A Brilliant Touch.,,,,,
,1468,Superb,,,,,
,1471,Pizzas Were A Bit Soggy & Too Much Topping,,,,,
,1472,We Used Room Service To Order From The Castle Bistro - The Ladies Who Brought The Food Were Very Good  Cheerful And Friendly  But The Chips And Pizza Were Definitely Burnt And The Burgers Were Rather Move Rare Than Is Usual. We Didn't Complain But It Did Discourage Us From Ordering Again.,,,,,
,1473,We Have To Say That We Preferred The Bistro! We Dined In Each Venue And Found That The Edwardian Grill Had A Rather Limited And Slightly Pretentious Menu  We Were Also Disappointed With The Breakfast Buffet  Pale Unappetising Sausages And Soggy Bacon! The Waitress Also Lost Our Egg Order And We Waited For Nearly Half An Hour For A Poached And A Fried Egg!! Though 'John' Was Charm Itself And Would Have Smoothed The Ruffles Of The Most Agitated Customer!! He Is A Good Find For The Hotel.,,,,,
,1477,Lovely Meal With Excellent Service,,,,,
,1478,Food Needs Variationfor Children.,,,,,
,1479,The Castle Bistro  Would Have Benefited From Having A Greater Variety Of Foods For Both Adults And Children.,,,,,
,1482,Great Quality Of Food And Service Reflected Fairly In The Price.,,,,,
,1485,The Edwardian Restaurant Was Way Overpriced.  We've Eaten In Michellin Star Restaurants That Charge Less.  Also For A Fine Dining Restaurant Charging Premium Prices I Would Expect Small Intermediate Courses Courtesy Of The Chef Such As Sorbets For Example.  This Is The Norm For Fine Dining.,,,,,
,1486,I Think You Should Buy The Ring O Bells Pub. Most People From The Hotel Dined There. This Would Suggest A Disconnect Between The Edwardian And The Bistro Restaurant. I Find The Edwardian Very Beautiful  But The Chairs And Decor Are Dated . I Also Feel The Fine Dining Isn't What You Want Eveynight  Whilst The Bistro Lacks Evening Atmosphere..Perhaps The 5.30 Children's Menu Could Run Until 7.30. This Gives You A Chance To Eat Later- Especially As I Didn't See 'Toddlers'  But Rising 6 Children And Young Adults.,,,,,
,1488,Dinner Was 5 Star  Food Amazing  Staff Faultless  Perfect In Everyway!!!!!,,,,,
,1490,We Just Found The Service Very Slow And The Food Was Not To The Standard We Would Have Expected With All The Other Perfection Of Bovey Castle And The Delicious Breakfasts We Enjoyed Each Day At The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,1491,The Service In The Bistro Could Do With More Staff It Takes To Long For Meals To Arrive Very Slow Service Even When The Restaurant Is Quiet.The Meals Sit On Side When Ready Waiting To Be Sent To The Tables.We Were A Party Of Six And From The First Meal Arriving It Was Nearly 10 Mins Before All Food Ordered Arrived.,,,,,
,1492,We Only Had Breakfast In The Edwardian Grill. We Had Dinner For 3 Nights In The Castle Bistro And Sandwiches In The Bar.  The Service For Breakfast Was Very Slow And We Had To Remind The Waiter For Our Coffee Each Day. Service In Castle Bistro Was Very Friendly And Efficient. Nice Touches Were The Ice Cream And Chocolates.,,,,,
,1493,Not All Staff Are Good Enough/Trained - Lots Of Occasions With Dishes Not Remembered  Or Where We Need To Ask For Things Again Or For More Things.   Not All Staff Are As Friendly. Note  The Manager Is Very Good.,,,,,
,1495,Service Was A Little Slow But Friendly,,,,,
,1496,I Had The Pate To Start Unfortunately Some Of The Cling Film Was Still Present  Didnt Moan These Things Do Happen. This Dish Was A Bit Disappointing Considering The Cost. However The Cheese Board Was The Best. Personally I Had The Chocholate Desert Just Because I Liked The Sound Of The Ice Cream  Which Was Ok  The Chocholate Was Too Rich For Me  My Fault For Choosing  Should Of Just Had The Ice Cream.,,,,,
,1498,Somewhat Surprised At The Number Of Children In The Edwardian Grill On A Saturday Eveneing But Generally Well Behaved,,,,,
,1501,The Staff In Both Venues Were Exceptional. I Particularly Enjoyed The Music Provided By The Pianist As We Dined In The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,1503,Some Bistro Staff Struggled With Language,,,,,
,1504,The Service In The Bistro On The First Night Was Very Slow  But Was Remedied When Frederico Got Involved  We Had Problems With Accuracy Of Orders In The Main Restaurant With The Foreign Waiters And Felt They Needed More Training In Getting It Right First Time  And A Better Understanding Of Our Language  They Tried Hard And Were Very Courteous,,,,,
,1505,The Service And Quality Of Food Was Of A High Standard.,,,,,
,1507,First Night Excellent Stream Less Dining Experience From Pre Dinner Drinks To Taking The Order Then Been Shown Through To The Dining Room. Second Night  The Process Seamed Disjointed  A Little Slow And Confused.  Tension Should Also Have Been Paid To Refilling/ Topping Up Champagne Glasses  We Had To Do It Ourselves Throughout Pre Drinks. Not Acceptable When Paying Said Price.,,,,,
,1510,The Service Was Often Slow - It Appeared That The Staff Were Stretched.,,,,,
,1514,The Edwardian Dining Experience Was Perfect But The Bistro Was Very Disappointing. We Waited About An Hour To Get Our Food. My Pizza Was Then Undercooked. We Were Told The Restaurant Was Short Staffed. It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Selection Of Sandwiches On The Menu. I Tried To Book Afternoon Tea But Was Told I Couldn't Because They Were Again Short Staffed. But There Were A Lot Of Tables Available In The Lounges. Very Disappointing As The Tea Looked Lovely.,,,,,
,1517,Our Only Niggle Was Children Running Round The Restaurant At Breakfast Time (Perhaps The Bistro Could Open For Children's Breakfast?),,,,,
,1518,The Chef Came Out To Speak To Our Friends Who Were Vegans   He Was Helpful ( And More Patient Than I Would Have Been ! ) And The Staff Couldn't Have Been More Helpful,,,,,
,1519,Great Choice And Anything Goes .......!,,,,,
,1521,Fantastic In Both Venues. Extensive Menus And Was Spoilt For Choice!! All Plates Appealing In  Presentation And Taste. We All Commented On The Pleasant Experience At Each Meal.,,,,,
,1522,Pre Dinner Drinks Service Was Haphazard.On First Night I Had To Remind Staff Of Our Order On 3 Occasions Which Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,1523,Breakfast Was Excellent On Both Mornings. Delighted That They Presented Me With A Glass Of Champs To Celebrate My Birthday On The 21St. Our Dining Was Superb. Very Impressed With Your Cheese Selection And Presentation Wow!!,,,,,
,1524,Atmosphere Is Lacking In The Bistro,,,,,
,1525,The Bistro Is Not Well Run - The Staff Are Very Haphazard In Their Attention To The Customer. There Are A Few Individuals Who Are Very Good - A Rather Large Girl With Dark Hair Was Very Good. (Sorry I Don't Know Her Name) She Stood Out Because The Others Were So Sloppy By Comparison.,,,,,
,1526,I Truly Like To Thank The Staff Who Were Serving Our Msia Group For Their Patience And Due Diligence. It Was Sometimes Chaotic Because We Were A Large Group And Not Many Remembered Their Dinner Choices. My Sense Is That There Were Not Enough Staff To Serve The Group That Large. However  I Could Be Wrong. I Am Grateful For Those Who Served Us With So Much Gusto. Thank You Very Very Much!!,,,,,
,1527,Edwardian Grill  Boken Wine Glass Found On Table Taken Away No Apologies. Staff Need To Know Which Table They Are Taking Dishes To Not Going Back To Or 3 Times Until They Get Lucky. Need To Know About Menue As Questions Asked Would Have To Reffer. Very Long Delays Between Each Course  Couple On Next Table Waited Nearly 1 Hour Before Receiving Anything. On Signing The Bill An Extra Â£45 Had Been Added Again Without Appologies. Attention To Detail Disapointing Compeared To Previous Stays.  Castle Bisto  Having Been Given Main Dish And Asked If Anything Else Wanted And Asking For Ketchup And Salt Pepper After Waiting Over 5 Mins Went And Collected Myself From Bar Area. Having To Ask For Drinks Twicw Be For Receiving And Bringing Defferent Desert Than Ordered. Staff Need To Finish Dealing With Order After Asking Before Moving On To Others And Forgeting,,,,,
,1530,Very Impressed With The Quiet Professionalism Of The Edwardian Grill Staff - Made The Dining Experience A Pleasure.,,,,,
,1533,The Food Was Of Good Quality Although Could Have Done With Larger Portions. The Atmosphere Was Lacking Due The Lack Of Background Music From A Pianist Or Even Just A Cd Playing. Felt Like Everybody Was Whispering The Whole Time.  I Must Say George The Sommelier Was Extremely Helpful And Had The Perfect Approach.,,,,,
,1534,The Service At The Bistro Wasn't Anywhere As Good As The Grill.,,,,,
,1535,Maybe Have More Selection For Bistro Cause I Ordered Same Dishes Each Day Would Have Been Great To Have A Change. Also Can We Stock Snacks In Room For Charging As I Didn't Want To Call Room Service As Often And Would Have Eaten The Snacks.,,,,,
,1536,More Choice Would Be Nice,,,,,
,1537,Just Had A Quick Fish And Chip Meal With Our Children Before We Left But It Was Fine. We Aldo Had Afternoon Tea With Non Resident Friends On Saturday Afternoon Which Was Lovely. We Asked For A Fireside Table But As There Were Nine Of Us This Wasn't Possible In One Of The Lounges. We Were Given A Private Room Which I Was Initially Not Sure About But It Was Lovely And Meant That The Children Could Be Themselves A Bit More And We Could All Relax.,,,,,
,1538,In The Bistro  We Asked The Waiter If The Hamburger Was Pure Beef With No Fillers Or Anything Added To Ti. He Said No.  The Burger Had Onions And Other Spices In It.  We Switched Plates Because We Did Not Have Time To Wait For Another Burger.  Make Sure The Waiters Know What They Are Talking About.,,,,,
,1539,Last Year We Ate At The Edwardian Grill And Had A Taster Menu Which Was Delicious. We Would Have Eaten There This Year If There Had Been Something Similar Available. We Thought The Menu This Year Was A Bit Plain For The Prices.,,,,,
,1541,Restricted Vegetation Options,,,,,
,1542,We Were Originally Booked Into Bistro But Moved To Edwardian Grill As Bistro Atmosphere Was V Disappointing. When We Were Given Pre-Dinner Nibbles My Partner Ate What I Think Was Quails Egg And Was Very Unwell In The Night. We Didn't Mention It On Checking Out As Lots If Other Guests Around And We Had V Enjoyable Stay Apart From This But Bring It To Your Attention Ax It Did Distract From Our Stay. Also  Milk In Room Was Slightly Off With Bits In It And Although Staff Were Excellent And Immediately Changed It  It's Not Ideal.,,,,,
,1547,We Just Had Afternoon Tea Outside Which Was Very Nice  But We Were Surprised Not To Be Offered A Fresh Pot Of Tea.,,,,,
,1550,I Have Ticked 'Excellent' As These Comments Pertain To The Edwardian Grill.  The Bistro Was Also Excellent On Our First Night  With Attentive Staff  Good Atmosphere Etc And We Felt 'Special'.  However On Our Last Evening The Service Was Positively Abysmal.  The Staff Were Not Very Professional And Should Take A Leaf From Their Peers Who Run A Faultless Service In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,1551,The Only Reason The Mark For Service Was Dropped Was Due To The Long Wait We Had In The Oak Bar Waiting To Be Served. We Where Asked To Take A Seat And Someone Will Be With You In A Moment. About 15 Minutes Later We Stopped Someone And Asked To Have Our Order Taken. Staff Where Very Friendly And Very Good  But It Seemed Very Slow At This Time (Late Lunch),,,,,
,1552,We Ordered Nibbles To Start.  Bread With Balsamic/Oil And Nuts And Olives.  I Had To Complain About The Nuts As They Were All Broken Up And Damaged  Very Poor Quality.  We Did Get Them Complimentary With An Apology.  My Wife Had A Starter From The Specials Board.  Tomato  Mozzarella Side Salad And Fioccia Bread.  The Tomatoes Were Ordinary Toms And So Had Little Flavour And She Did Not Receive The Bread.  As The Check Back Was Not Made Till She Finished The Staff Member Just Dismissed The Fact She Did Not Receive It.  When My Wifes Main Of Moules Arrived I Mentioned The Fioccia Again And As The Moules Came With Bread She Just Said It's On It's Wasy.  We Never Received The Fioccia!!!.  We Asked If There Was A Kids Pack  Colouring Or Something.  We Received 2 Sheets Of Paper And Some Wax Crayons  Adequate But Not Anything To Get Excited About.  Overall The Service Was Quick And Food At The Correct Temperatures And Tasted Good.,,,,,
,1553,Excellent Cuisine And Service.,,,,,
,1557,There Was A Good Selection Of Food On The Menu  All Reasonably Priced.  The Food Was Delicious  And The Chocolate Brownies Were Heavenly.  Becca Our Waitress Was Fantastic Both With Us And The Other Diners  Attending To Us Sensitively And Responsively  Professionally And Amiably ,,,,,
,1560,Lovely Food But Limited Wine Selection That's Mainly French And Expensive For The Venue,,,,,
,1562,It Was Our Wedding Anniversary On The Monday And The Meal Made It All The More Spcial,,,,,
,1563,Dinner Was Lovely With A Varied And Interesting Menu. Soufflã© Was Delicious. Afternoon Tea Was Equally Good. However The Tea Was Brewed With Cold Tea Which Was A First In My Dining Experience. Quite Odd.,,,,,
,1564,In Particular Your Service Immaculate The Food Perfect As I You Know  For Me  Sunday Lunch Was A Disaster Never Have Sunday Lunch At Â£25.99 I Should Have Known I Know You Have To Open Your Doors To All For Afternoon Tea  Delicious If I Owned Your Hotel I Would Never Spoil The Reputation Of  What In My Opinion The Perfect Retreat  I Have Been To Most!!! Can't Wait For My Return Visit. Roland Hebeler,,,,,
,1565,Excellent Food And Service. Wine Could've Been Brought To The Table Quicker - We Probably Would Have Had Another Bottle! A Full Cup Of Coffee Would Be Appreicated  As A Black Coffee Drinker This Is A Perennial Problem! Very Impressive Cheese Board.,,,,,
,1566,We Had Lunch In Private Room And Then Dinner In Main Dining Area - The Comments Above Are Relative To The Lunch In Private Room The Dinner Menu Was Exceptional,,,,,
,1567,Just Lovely,,,,,
,1569,Breakfast On Our First Morning Was Really Poor. The Staff Were All Very Accommodating But All The Warm Breakfast Items Were Cold And Poorly Cooked (The Sausages Were Rock Hard As Though They Had Been Cooked Quite A While Earlier; The Bacon  Mushrooms  Beans & Eggs Were All Cold And Not Very Nice). I Mentioned This To The Waiter Who Took My Breakfast & Everything Else Back To The Kitchen And After Some Scratching Around Re-Filled The Breakfast Containers And Invited Me To Refill My Plate. Sadly  Whilst There Was A Few New Pieces Of Bacon  The Sausages Were Clearly The Same & Mushrooms Etc Were Still Cold And Simply Not The Standard I Expected. However  We Dined In The Edwardian Grill That Evening And Breakfasted The Following Morning  Both Experiences Were An Absolute Triumph!!,,,,,
,1570,We All Thought The Quality Of The Food And It's Presentation Was Very Good Indeed And Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Meal. It Isn't Michelin Cooking And Is Quite Expensive But Every Dish Was Cooked Extremely Well And The Ingredients Were Of Very Good Quality  A Delightful Meal.,,,,,
,1574,Perfect Friendly Staff!,,,,,
,1575,Although Nice  I Felt The Bistro Atmosphere And Decor Wasn't Quite Up To Bovey Castles High Standard  But That Is Probably More Personal Choice.  Though The Food And Staff  Were Excellent As Usual.,,,,,
,1577,We Had A Table Reserved But When We Came Down  A Table Had Not Been Saved For Us. The Restaurant Manager Was Not Particularly Helpful. He Told Us It Was Reception's Fault And They Had Taken Too Many Reservations And On The Night The Tables Were Given Away On A First Come First Served Basis. We Had To Wait An Hour And A Half For A Table To Come Available. The Restaurant Manager Did Not Look After Us Very Well At All. In Fact We Sat For Quite A While Just Waiting To Order A Drink Since We Had Been Told Someone Would See To Us. In The End  I Had To Go Up To The Bar To Order. The Bar Was Not Particularly Busy At The Time. Generally The Staff Were Very Friendly And Professional However In The Restaurant And Bar.,,,,,
,1578,The Food Was - And Always Had Bee In My Experience - The Weakest Element Of The Hotel Offer. Sandwiches Were Uninspiring And The Meat - Lamb Steak? - Almost Impossible To Cut. Also Veg Was Over Salted. You Seriously Need To Address This Aspect Of Bovey.,,,,,
,1579,After A Long Journey Sandwiches Or Similar Would Be Appreciated. Perhaps The Offer Of Tea & Biscuits On Arrival ?,,,,,
,1580,No,,,,,
,1581,Impeccable In Every Way,,,,,
,1582,Everything Was Great  But Having Been To Nathan Outlaws Restaurant The Night Before There Was An Obvious Difference In The Level Of Service. It Was Really Good At Bovey  But Not Perfect. Most Annoying Was The Lack Of Up To Date Cocktail Menu. The Staff Were Happy To Make Drinks That Weren't On The Menu But It Meant That Each Staff Member Made Them In A Different Way. We Had Strawberry Daquiris  First Made With Fresh Strawberries  Which We Were Very Impressed By  But Later Made Without Any Strawberries At All  Not As Good!,,,,,
,1584,Everything Was Just Perfect !!! Well Done From Leah Webber And Julia (Serving Us),,,,,
,1585,Outstanding Food In All Areas,,,,,
,1586,See Back. Superb,,,,,
,1587,The Above Ratings Relate To The Edwardian Grill. We Also Dined In The Bistro With Our Young Children. Whilst The Adult Menu Was Good  We Felt The Children's Menu Was Basic With Only 3 Options. Most Children Also Prefer Penne Or Fusilli Rather Than Spagetti.,,,,,
,1590,The Staff At The Bistro Were Very Unorganised And Met The Rest Of The  Castle Team Down,,,,,
,1591,There Was Not Enough Seating. More Room Could Have Been Made By Moving Some Of The Other Furniture.,,,,,
,1592,The Private Dining (Company Function) Was Absolutely Superb  As Was The Breakfast.  The Bistro Meal Was Not Up To The Same Mark (Assortment Of Cold Meats Was Overly Dry  Suggesting They Had Not Been Freshly Cut And The Venison Was Also Slightly Dry).  The Wines Were Excellent.,,,,,
,1594,Frederico Invited Us For A Private Champagne Reception In The Library... Fabulous  He Made Us Feel Very Special.,,,,,
,1596,Only Criticism ( A Small One In An Otherwise Fantastic Experience) Was The Buffet Breakfast Was Largely Only Luke Warm And The Sausages Were Not Of A Good Quality,,,,,
,1597,Breakfast Could Be Much Better...Go To Gleneagles And See How Its Done,,,,,
,1603,No,,,,,
,1608,Again Looked After By Staff - Thet Were Marvellous - Nothing To Much Trouble,,,,,
,1609,A Real Pleasure To Have A Restaurant That Good In A Large Hotel.,,,,,
,1610,Amazing Views,,,,,
,1611,The Food Was Amazing  Could Not Fault It. The Decor Of The Restaurant We Felt Could Be Refreshed As It Didn't Feel Quite To The Same Standard As The Food. Service Was Outstanding.,,,,,
,1613,The Edwardian Grill Was A Real Disappointment. As Already Mentioned We Have Been To Bovey A Few Times And I Don't Think The Menu Had Changed Since We Stayed 18 Months Ago. A Real Shame As I Have Always Loved Dining There But Felt This Time It Lacked Good Food  Ambience And Even The Service Wasn't As Good As It Has Been On Previous Occassions. I Would Suggest Guests Would Like A Seasonal Menu With Local Products Which Allows A New Dining Experience. Not The Same Dishes For Such A Long Time.,,,,,
,1615,Food Was Excellent As Always  Excellent Service Too.,,,,,
,1616,The Cooked Breakfast Was The Only Disappointment Of The Whole Stay.  Really Quite Bad  Dry And Bland.,,,,,
,1617,The Lunch Menu In The Oak Bar Is Very Limited  A Choice Of Only Three Somewhat Expensive Sandwiches. We Ate An Organised  Pre-Ordered Dinner In The Bistro On Monday Evening And Broadly It Was Awful. My Battered Fish Had Obvioulsy Been Sitting Under The Heat Lamps For Ages And Was Cooked Dry. Other Meals In The Range Weren't Much Cop Either. This Has Now Been The Case On Our Last Two Organised Stays At Bovey And The Pre-Ordered Meal Each First Night. I Would Rather Eat Out.,,,,,
,1620,Choice In Bistro Poor. Service Variable. Wines Overpriced. Dull,,,,,
,1621,Excellent Staff. Love The Beef Menu.,,,,,
,1624,No Very Pleasant And Made To Feel At Home!,,,,,
,1625,Very Relaxing And Welcoming,,,,,
,1626,The Quality And Speed Of Service In The Bar And The The Edwardian Grill For Pre-Dinner Drinks And Morning Coffee And Dinner Was Very Good Indeed.  The Service For Afternoon Tea In The Great Hall Was Exceptional.  However The Speed Of Service In The Castle Bistro For Lunch Was Poor - Very Slow Indeed.  Also The Speed Of Service And Attentiveness Of Some Of The Staff For Breakfast Could Be Improved.,,,,,
,1628,We Dined In The Bovey Room Due To A Function Taking Place In The Castle Bistro So It Is Difficult To Judge.,,,,,
,1634,I Didn't Think That The Food (Especially Lunch) In The Bistro Reflected The Quality Present Throughout The Rest Of The Hotel. Could Not Fault The Service In There And The Staff Were Very Accommodating.,,,,,
,1638,The Staff Were Very Busy With Both Restaurants Full.  We Hadn't Made A Reservation So Both Reception And Bistro Staff Went Out Of Their Way To Make Sure We Were Accommodated And Looked After.  Again - Very Impressed.,,,,,
,1645,The Hotel Was Full With German Guests But We Were Given No Choice But To Eat In A Smaller Room With No Explanation. We Actually Felt Outcast And Heard Other Guests Comment On The Same. Also It Was Wrong For A Member Of Staff To Be Training A Giggling Junior Whilst Eating Dinner. Again This Was Not A 5 Star Experience.,,,,,
,1646,Not Impressed With The Bistro - Menu Choice Very Limited  Food Average Nothing Special And Wines Expensive. The Ring Of Bells Pub In The Village (Which We Went To For Dinner On Our Second Night) Was Much Better Menu/Food/Value For Money - If We Come Again We Will Eat There Not The Bistro.  Breakfast Was Good Though!,,,,,
,1648,Small Piece Of Crad Shell Found In Crab Mousse.  Goats Cheese Starter - Too Much Cheese And Leeks Very 'Al Dente'.,,,,,
,1652,The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent  And The Bistro Had A Friendly Atmosphere Both With Good Service,,,,,
,1653,I Sent An Email On October 16Th Regarding Our Dining Experiences  Please Refer. The Service In The Bistro Was Appalling And The Selection Of Food In The Grill Was Limited Especially When Staying For 4 Nights. Overall This Was The Most Disappointing Aspect Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,1654,I Think The Process Of Just Going For A Drink In The Bars Generally Could Be Quicker!!,,,,,
,1655,The Food Was Much Better Than Expected.  We Really Enjoyed The Edwardian Grill -- And Friends Who Had Been Previously Had Said That It Was Not That Great.  So -- Tell Your Chef!  We Will Be Recommending Food In The Castle!,,,,,
,1656,We Felt That We Had To Wait Too Long For Our Food To Be Served After Placing Our Order.,,,,,
,1658,No,,,,,
,1659,The Bacon At Breakfast Was A Bit Tough Otherwise The Food Was Excellent,,,,,
,1660,At Both Dinner And Breakfast There Appeared To Be Lots Of Staff But Service Was Not Particularly Good. We Had A 10 Minute Wait For Breakfast Table.,,,,,
,1661,Yes  Unfortunately I Was Very Disappointed With My Meal.  I Requested A Steak Medium To Well Done And When It Was Served It Was Very Well Done And Very Tough And Difficult To Cut.  The Waitress Apologised And Sent It Back To The Kitchen To Be Redone.  I Then Had To Waited For About 30 Mins But By This Time  My Wife Was Finished With Her Meal So I Just Requested Some Cheese And Biscuits.  I Was Quite Disappointed With This.  I Have Stayed At The Castle Before But On This Occasion I Was Treated By Way Of A Voucher By A Family Friend And She Purchased B & B  Evening Meal And Golf Package.  I Feel That We Didnt Avail Of The Full Package Due To The Dinner Experience And I Would Kindly Request That The Value Of My Main Course Be Refunded To Her On The Card She Used To Make The Booking.  If You Need To Confirm This  Please Call Jennifer On 01534 721179.,,,,,
,1663,The Food Was Very Good And It Was Nice To Have Different Options To Choose From,,,,,
,1664,The Wine Selection To Choose From Was Very Good But Only Had One Bottle Of Each Wine We Ordered Both Nights Which Was Disappointing. Not Sure If It's Possible To Ensure You Don't Run Out Of Wine (To Have Min Stock Of 12 Bottles Of Each Might Be A Good Plan During Quite Times) I'm Sure This Would Not Be The Case When The Hotel Is Busy During Summer Months.,,,,,
,1666,Breakfast Was Disappointing Compared To All The Other Meals Taken,,,,,
,1670,Generally Very Good  However  My Medium Rare Ribeye Steak Was A Little Tough And In The Morning  We Were Unsure As To Whether To Serve Ourselves A Cooked Breakfast From The Buffet Or Await A Fresh Plate Via The Waiting Staff. We Did / Got Both !,,,,,
,1671,The Bistro Was Very Nicely Appointed  But The Staff Were A Little Inexperienced.  I Asked For Redcurrant Sauce With My Lamb And The Waitress Looked Blank And Said She Didn't Think It Was Available But Would Ask In The Kitchen - She Never Came Back With An Answer.,,,,,
,1674,Superb Experience,,,,,
,1675,Bistro Was Fine  Service In Edwardian Very Disappointing. Dishes Were Consistently Presented To The Wrong Person. We Were Not Server Bread  Until After The Starter Due To Us Flagging Down A Waiter. We Waited An Hour Between The Starter And The Main Course. We Ordered Cheese  And Rather Than Being Server From The Cheese Board As Usual (And As Indicated By The Menu)  Our Â£14 Cheese Course Was 6 Small Pre-Selected Portions. We Were Not Alerted To This At Any Point  So Sent Them Back. The  Maitre D' Arranged For A Good (Though  Probably Not Full) Selection To Be Brought On The Trolley Subsequently.,,,,,
,1676,Waited 2 Hours For The Food (Booked For 8.45 Started Eating Approx 10.35) Our Vegetables And Side Orders Were Taken To Another Table Without Checking This Was The Correct Order For These Diners. When This Was Highlighted Then Waited A Further 10 - 15 Minutes For The Replacement Order Whilst The Main Meals Were Going Cold. We Still Did Not Get What Was Originally Ordered I Feel That The Front Of House And Service Was Of A Very Poor Standard And Ruined The Overall Dining Experience,,,,,
,1677,Staff Having Difficulty Paying Attention To Guests Not In Large Party,,,,,
,1680,The Bistro Food Was Very Good  The Service Was Faultless.  The Atmosphere Was Not Very 'Bistro'-Like.   Check Table Cloths Would Help - It Needs To Be Cosier And A Little Less Plastic.   I Was Served An Ordinary Coffee At The End Of The Meal And There Was 1/2 Coffee In The Cup - Less Than My Husband's Expresso!!!   The Waitress Gave Me Hot Water To Top It Up - I Found This Bizarre.,,,,,
,1683,The Value At The Castle Bistro Was Very Good  Although The Ambiance Was Too Contemporary For The Castle. The Edwardian Grill Was Too Expensive For The Price And We Left Our Meal Hungry.  The Chef Tried To Hard To Create Dishes That Looked Better Than They Tasted And The Amount Of Food Was Minimal  Too Much Flair For Presentation And Too Little For Substance.,,,,,
,1685,The Service And Food Was Excellent - Cake Too!,,,,,
,1689,The Meal That We Ate In The Brasserie Was Very Good  However I Felt That The Choice  Of Main Courses Particularly  Was Rather Limited And Had Expected A Greater Variety.,,,,,
,1690,Service Was Exemplary,,,,,
,1694,The Â£45 Per Person Allowance Should Have Been Made Known.,,,,,
,1697,Service At Breakfast On The Second Day Was A Little Slow.,,,,,
,1699,Excellent Relates To The Edwardian Grill  The Castle Bistro Had Nice Food  But The Setting Felt A Lot Like A Canteen.,,,,,
,1700,Brilliant All Round - The Sommelier And Dare I Say Cheese Sommelier Were Really Knowledgable Without Any Arrogance And They Were Super,,,,,
,1703,The Service And Food In The Edwardian Grill Were Excellent But The Castle Bistro Was Disappointing In The Choice Of Food And The Service Could Have Been Sharper. The Service In The Oak Bar Was Mediocre And While The Price Of The Drinks Were The Same For Whatever Dining Option  We Were Only Offered Bar Snacks When We Were Dining In The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,1705,The Wedding Service Was Exceptional  The Breakfast Service Was Fair At Best  Long Time To Clear Tables   Bring Out Special Orders  Teas  Coffees Etc,,,,,
,1706,A Few Comments That The Food Was Excellent  Although Not Quite Up To The Standard Of The Food When The Bride  Groom And Family Had Been Down Several Months Beforehand To Decide On The Menu,,,,,
,1708,Staff In Both The Grill And Bistro Were Helpful  Well Informed And Friendly - Just The Right Balance Of Informality & Attentiveness Without Being Intrusive.,,,,,
,1709,Couldn't Be More Pleased With Our Experience.,,,,,
,1710,I Thought The Service  Whilst Very Polite  Was Average. It Took About 90 Mins To Receive Our 1 Course Meal In The Bistro Where The Drinks Service Was Not Great. Our Celebration Meal In The Edwardian Grill Was Again Polite But One Order Was Forgotten  So One Of Us Had To Eat Their Meal After Everyone Else Had Finished. The Fact There Was No Offer Of A Drink/The Meal To Be Deducted Off The Bill Was In My View Very Poor. The Drinks Service Was Very Poor Also-At No Point Were We Asked For Drinks-Both Times We Had To Call Someone Over. The Surroundings Were Excellent  The Food Good  But The Service Did Distract From Our Enjoyment Of The Experience  Which Was A Shame.,,,,,
,1711,Compliments To The Staff In The Bistro  In Particular  The Young Dark Haired Man Who Was Very Helpful And Appeared To Take A Genuine Interest In What We Were Doing.,,,,,
,1712,Staff Were All Excellent,,,,,
,1713,Wedding Breakfast Exceedingly Good.  Eat In The Bistro Later On And Could Not Fault It.,,,,,
,1714,Excellent Service And Food. No Complaints At All.,,,,,
,1720,Excellent Food Included In The Dinner Bed And Breakfast Tariff (Apart From Club Sandwich In The Bar For Lunch Where Bacon Was Completely Underdone And Served With Layers Of Undercooked Rind - Yuk). Children's Menu Was Quite Unimaginative - E.G. Spg Bol / Chips Etc - I Had To Ask For Cheese On Toast Or Children's Veg Selection,,,,,
,1721,Over Promised Under Delivered,,,,,
,1722,I Felt The Food Was Of Good Quality Although My Personal View Was The Portions Were Rather Small ! I Also Felt You Have Too Many Staff So Everything Happen In Record Speed. Not So Relaxing.,,,,,
,1726,Very Professional Service In The Edwardian Grill And We Had An Excellent Experience. The Staff In The Castle Bistro Though Would Most Likely Benefit From A Course In Service And Attention To Details. The Wait For Ordering (Even Getting Two Menus) And The Food Was Very Long And In Addition The Staff Passed Litter On The Floor And Un-Cleared Tables Several Times Without Dealing With It. For Example; There Was A Pen Lying Around Under One Of The Radiators. You Might Want To Check If That Is Still There..,,,,,
,1727,Given The High Standard Of The Hotel I Think That The Bistro Food Could Have Been Of A Higher Quality . Although I Recognize That It Is Your Informal Offering It Would Have Been Good To Have Had A More Adventurous Menu That Required Greater Cookery Skills. My First Choice Was A Pizza With Anchovies But The Waiter Said That You Had Run Out Of These Which Seemed Odd And So I Chose The Fish Which Was Simply Cooked.I Suppose You Could Describe The Food As Being Akin To Pub Food Whereas I Thought It Might Be More Like A Brasserie Blanc.,,,,,
,1729,Food In The Bistro Was Not As Good As Might Have Been Expected  Quality Of Steak Was Average At Best  But Could Have Been A Poor Cut (Ribeye) Level Of Service In The Grill Was Excellent  Perhaps Even At Times A Little Too Attentive.,,,,,
,1730,The Above Marks Of Excellent Go To The Edwardian Grill For Dinner On The First Night. The Breakfast  Was Lacking In So Far As We Had To Wait Quiet A While To Be Seated On Second Morning  No Medium Plates For Having Some Cold Meats Etc  And On Second Morning Cheese Had Dried And Curled Up Fruit Platter Not Replaced And No Bread Out On Desplay. There Seemed To Be No One In Charge Of Breakfast  No Supervision Of Food Table Cleaning  Very Basic Stuff. The Second Evening We Ate In Castle Bistro Which I Felt Had A Very Limited Menu. Two Burgers On Mains No Real Choice And When It Came To Dessert We Were Told They Had Run Out Of Most Desserts. The Restaurant Was Not Busy And Even So No Excuse.  My 19Teen Year Old Had To Tell Them Maybe It Would Be A Good Idea To Go To The Other Restaurant And Serve Dessert From Their Menu. This Should Not Happen In A Hotel Of Your Standing And Hope It Will Be Sorted. Could Do With Wider Wine Choice Also.,,,,,
,1735,We Had Some Problems On One Night In The Edwardian Grill  Which Was Well Handled By The Hotel Manager Who Looked After Us Very Well,,,,,
,1736,Edwardian Grill Room Lacked Atmosphere It Was Thought,,,,,
,1737,What A Poor Menu  No Fresh Local Produce At All.The Bread Roll That Our Burger Came With Was Hard.Also The Bacon Was Well Over Cooked. What A Poor Showing  I Am Sure You Can Do Better Than That,,,,,
,1739,The Grill Was Nicely Formal But A Little Over-Priced. The Bistro Was V Fairly Priced But Was Too Cafetereish In The Evening. (Would Have Benefited From Tablecloths And Candles Perhaps In One Area) Nice And Informal In The Daytime Though.,,,,,
,1740,Very Disappointed With Our Dining Experience....Food Cooked And Presented Was Not Really What Should Be Served At Bovey.,,,,,
,1741,The Castle Bistro Was Managed And Run Very Well.  Our Experience In The Edwardian Restaurant Was Not As Favourable.  We Waited At The Table For The Order To Be Taken For App. 15 Minutes  And Then Waited For The 1St Course To Arrive Some 40 Minutes Later(Very Good When It Did).  There Was Yet Another Long Time Lapse For The Main Course 30 To 40 Mins  Again Good When It Arrived  But Spoiled What Could Have Been An Excellent Evening.,,,,,
,1743,Again Staff Were Excellent And Food A Pure Joy With Some Lovely Unusual Dishes  All Presented Beautifully.,,,,,
,1744,The Sea Bass Was Small In Size And The Scollops Although Very Tasty Wasn't Good Value For Money However I Had The Beefwellington And It Was Outstanding ,,,,,
,1745,We Loved The Food And The Service Was Faultless. Most Enjoyable.,,,,,
,1746,30 Mins For Pre Dinner Drinks And Unattentive Wine Waiter Spoilt Our Evening.,,,,,
,1747,Same Menue For Three Nights....Maybe A Daily Special ?,,,,,
,1748,Grill Service Excellent. Bistro Waitresses Pushed To Keep The Pace.,,,,,
,1749,We Wanted To Book The Meal For 7;30 But Were Told That Only 7:00 And 9:30 Were Available So We Booked 7:00.There Was Only Us And Another Table In Use And There Were Still Many Tables Available When We Left At 8:15.Couldn't Understand That.,,,,,
,1750,The Food The First Night Was Very Good. (Steaks) The 2Nd Night My Husband Choose Fish Wich Was Tasteless And Looked Like It Had Just Been Defrosted And Then Overcooked. They Then Brought Him A Steak As It Had Been Good The Night Before But It Was Gristley And Dry. My Liver And Bacon Was Good. The Buffet Breakfast In The Grill Was Poor But The A La Cart The Next Day Was Good.,,,,,
,1751,Did Not Enjoy Eating In The Edwardian Restaurant  Does Not Fit In With The Rest Of The Beautiful Building Too Many Cheap Looking Mirrors And Nasty Covered Chairs.  Too Large  No Atmosphere  Too Close To Others When There Are Only A Few Tables In Use.  Did Not Enjoy Sitting Opposite And Watching The Waiting Staff Coming And Going From The Kitchen Area.  Wine And Water Was Not Topped Up Enough - Had To Do It Ourselves.  Definitely The Only Room That Needs Looking At Urgently.,,,,,
,1753,The Breakfast Was Exceptionally Good.,,,,,
,1754,The Food Was Really Well Cooked  Presented And Tasty  However The Front Of House Staff Weren't Very Welcoming  We Hadn't Booked As Reception Told Us We Wouldn't Have To However When We Arrived We Were Told We'd Have To Be Sat Somewhere Where We Wouldn't Annoy Any Other Guest That Had Booked! Also The Selection Of Food Was Not Very Varied  Why Don't You Offer A Separate Lunch Menu?,,,,,
,1755,Great As A Breakfast Room  Not Intimate Enough In The Evening For A Fine Dining Experience.,,,,,
,1756,We Ordered Pots Of Tea At Lunch  And Requested Sugar  But The Waiter Appeared To Have Forgotten About Us  And I Had To Seek It Myself.  In The Evening  I Felt The Staff Were More Focused On The Two Large Parties Dining On Another Table  As We Were Left For A Significant Amount Of Time Before Our Order Was Taken  And I Had To Ask For A Wine List At This Point Rather Than Been Offered At The Start. I Had Been Informed Of The Dress Code Of Smart Casual  No Denim  So Was Rather Disappointed To See Several Gents Wearing Jeans At Dinner.  Is There A Dress Code Or Not  And If So  Why Is It Not Enforced? I Asked For Coffee With Petit Fours  The Coffee Arrived  But I Had To Ask Again For The Petit Fours Some 10 Minutes Later.  The Staff Were Very Efficient When Prompted  But I Feel That For A Restaurant Of This Calibre  Prompting Shouldn't Be Necessary.,,,,,
,1762,We Should Have Been Told In Advance Or Possibly Compensated For The Edwardian Grill Being Unavailable Due To A Large Group.  The Other Rooms Provided As Alternatives Were Lacking In Abience.,,,,,
,1767,A Small Point Of Interest; It Was Too Warm In The Dining Room. All The Rest Was Very Good.,,,,,
,1769,It Was Valentines Night And The Service Was Very Slow. It Did Not Really Feel Like A Special Occasion And The Courses Delivered Were Wrong,,,,,
,1770,Edwardian Grill Was Brilliant In Every Way  And The Food Was Superb  Both Evening And Breakfast. Huge Thank You To Chefs And Serving Staff.  The Castle Bistro Was A Little Slow In Serving  But I Could See They Were Incredibly Busy So It Wasn't A Problem  And The Staff Were Lovely.,,,,,
,1771,Poor Service And Poor Food For The Price,,,,,
,1775,The Voucher For Dinner Was To Cover Â£30 Per Head. We Had To Pay Full Price For The Bottle Of Wine Despite The Overall Bill For The Meal Coming To Only Â£66. That Seemed Unreasonable And Unnecessarily Mean,,,,,
,1778,Please Could I Have The Recipe For The Lemon Tart  Thanks!!,,,,,
,1780,No,,,,,
,1781,We Ate In The Castle Bistro After Our Golf. I Felt The Area Added To The Identity Crisis Of The Place  As It Was Too Modern For An Old Building.  However  The Food And Service Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1782,There Was A Private Function In The Edwardian Grill On The Evening We Were There So We Were Seated In Another Room Which Although Beautifully Furnished Etc. Had No Atmosphere.  I Was Cold And The Room Felt Cold And Uninviting. So Experience Of Evening Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,1783,To Our Bewilderment  We Had Been Pre-Booked Into The Castle Bistro For The Three Nights Of Our Stay. Although We Were Able To Arrange A Table Each Evening In The Grill  The Timings Were Not Always Ideal.,,,,,
,1784,Absolutely First Rate In Every Respect.,,,,,
,1785,Our Meal In The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent,,,,,
,1788,Mulberry Room Was Excellent. Service Generally Fine  Senior Waiters' English Was Not Great,,,,,
,1789,Champagne Pannier Would Be A Welcome Addition!!,,,,,
,1791,Having Been Fortunate Enough To Travel Fairly Extensively Staying In Hotels We Have Never Had Service Charge Added To Our Bill As A Resident.,,,,,
,1792,We Went Into The Bistro After Playing Golf.  We Wanted A Coffee And Cake.  They Had Run Out Of Cakes/Pastries.  We Ordered A Sandwich But There Was No Bloomer Bread Left So We Just Had Ordinary Bread (Which Was Fine).  We Ate In The Bistro That Night But They Had Run Out Of Pinot Grigio.  We Didn't Expect A Place With Such A Reputation To Have Run Out Of These Basic Items.,,,,,
,1793,Staff Were Very Good. We Had To Sit In The Entrance To The Dining Room For Lunch  When I Asked If We Could Be Moved We Were Told That There Were More Guests Coming And That The Other Tables Were Reserved. Not Another Soul Arrived,,,,,
,1795,The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent  Staff  Decor  The Whole Package.,,,,,
,1796,I Felt That The Majority Of Staff Were Very Good But After Two Disappointing Episodes At Dinner Some Of The Younger Memembers Could Be Better Trained To Deal With Certain Situations.,,,,,
,1798,Think Maybe The Plastic Flowers In The Bistro Were A Bit Naff Otherwise Everything Was Spot On,,,,,
,1799,We Think The Overall Menu Should Be Simplified Eg. As The Beef Menu Is Presented.  Some Dishes Are Perhaps A Little Over-Sauced?,,,,,
,1800,Lunch In The Bistro Was Fine We Had A Guest. The Formal Meal In The Private Dining Room Was Disappointing. Starter Was Good But The Main Course- Lamb - Was Not Good  Tough And Tasteless Although The Presentation Was Good. Wines And Service Excellent,,,,,
,1801,Very Attractive Decor;  Efficient  Discreet Service;   Food Superb.  (Rib-Eye Steak Done To Perfection).  Only Criticism Would Be The Price Of The Wine.,,,,,
,1802,This Was A Cullenrey Delight Fine Dining Thanks To Fine Chefs,,,,,
,1803,Staff Were Rather Confused As To What They Were Doing  No Dry Sherry  No Tomato Sauce,,,,,
,1804,Terrine Looked Superb But Lacked Flavour Shortcrust Pastry On Beef Pie Was Very Short/Dry,,,,,
,1805,The Service And Limitatiion Of The Menu (Especially If One Is Staying For Five Days Or Longer) Does Not Warrant The Overall High Costs Of Dining In The Edwardian Restaurant.  In Particular The English Breakfasts Fell Short Of What One Expected.  For Example  Both Bacon And Sausages Were Very Overcooked.,,,,,
,1807,Lovely Meal,,,,,
,1809,Not Very Busy  So A Little Short On Atmosphere.,,,,,
,1813,Just Gorgeous!,,,,,
,1814,Overall The Standard Of Food And Service Was Very Good For Our Evening Meal. It Was Lovely To Have A Private Dining Room For Your Group.The Staff Were Very Attentive And Food Tasted Delicious.,,,,,
,1816,The Only Very Slight Dissapointment Was That A Somellier Was Not Available But The Restaurant Manager Did A Good Job In Their Place..,,,,,
,1819,We Very Much Enjoy The Informality Of The Bistro  But We Felt On This Occasion The Waiter Although Obliging Was Not Proactive As Is Your Usual Team Standard Ie Limited Menu Knowledge  There Was No Salt & Pepper On Our Table And No Starter Cutlery When Our Starters Came  And He Had To Be Reminded About Drinks Eventhough There Were Only A Few Diners. The Food When It Came Was Excellent As Always.,,,,,
,1820,It Is Really Excellent. Top Ingredients Not Messed Around With And Stunning Flavours And Presentation  Hope To Return Next Month And The Dining Is A Big Part Of That Decision,,,,,
,1823,We Spent The First Night In The Bistro & The 2Nd In The Grill - We Wish We Had Ate Both Nights In The Grill - Alot More Choice.,,,,,
,1826,It Was All Excellent. The Meal In The Edwardian Dining Room Was Especially Wonderful. The Staff  Again  Were All Very Helpful And Good At Their Jobs. Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,1827,As Always The Dining Facilities Are Exellent However  The Piped Music In The Bistro Was Very Loud And Was Distracting For Us And The Type Of Music Bore No Relation To The Venue  Though We Still Enjoyed Our Meals There.,,,,,
,1828,Pre Dinner Nibbles At Bar Would Have Been Nice Touch,,,,,
,1830,We Did Have To Wait A Long Time After Ordering Our Food Before It Arrived.,,,,,
,1831,The Edwardian Grill Is Fantastic.  An Amazing Place.  Lovely Staff And Delicious Food.  Couldn't Fault It.,,,,,
,1832,The Staff Were Professional And Attentive - Service Was Exceptional. Food Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1833,Staff Were Very Helpful,,,,,
,1836,Enjoyed Piano Playing Not The Music That Replaced It Whilst On His Break.,,,,,
,1837,It Took A Long Time For Our Pre-Dinner Drinks To Arrive. The Service Was A Little Erratic And Lacked Attention To Detail. The Menu Needs To Have A Better Balance With More Cleaner  Lighter Dishes; It Was All Rather Heavy And Rich. The Wine Service Was Poor. We Were Not Offered Liquers With Our After Dinner Coffee.,,,,,
,1838,Was All Really Good  We Did Wonder What Happened To The Wedding Cake  It Was Cut By The Bride And Groom But Never Saw It Again  Altho We Did Go To Bed At 12.00,,,,,
,1839,At Breakfast I Would Have Liked Grapefruit Juice  Grapefruit Segments (Or Fresh Grapefruit) And Prunes. Otherwise Choice Was Very Good.,,,,,
,1840,We Only Had Breakfast. The Cooked Breakfast Was Very Disappointing And The Toast Was Under Done Even Though We Sent It Back To Be Done Again . We Did Have An Afternoon Tea On Our Arrival Which Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1842,The Waiting Staff In The Bistro And At Breakfast Were Not As Enthusiastic   Well Informed About Your Menu Or Speedy As The Cocktail Bar   Reception And Valet Staff By A Mile .,,,,,
,1843,Our Only Comment Is That One Of The Breakfast Waiters Could Do With More Training  Very Grumpy Almost To The Verge Of Unhelpful.  Don't Care For Watery Tea With Large Leaves  Made With Warm Water  So Asked For Twinings Tea Bag In Boiling Water.,,,,,
,1847,Breakfast Could Have A Larger Range Of Options (Fruit  Juices Available  Types Of Bread Available),,,,,
,1851,We Were Not Offered Any Aperitif After Being Seated At Our Table. The Wine Order Took A Long Time Too.,,,,,
,1852,We Had Room Service Which Was Very Good. We Lover The Fish And Chips Wrapped In Newspaper!,,,,,
,1853,Service Can Be A Little Slow  But We Weren't In A Rush  So It Didn't Matter,,,,,
,1861,Lovely Food  But A Bit Pricey,,,,,
,1864,Really Lovely Touch That It Was My Birthday  And We Received A Bottle Of Champagne  And The Table Was Decorated.,,,,,
,1866,The Hotel Boasts 140 Whiskies However You Do Not Serve Famous Grouse Probably The Most Popular And Highly Thought Of Blended Whiskies. Only 2 Whisky Blends Were On Offer And They Are Both Aimed At The Japanese Market. Also You Might Like To Think About Serving Premium Mixers Such As Fever Tree. We Also Purchased In The Bar A Number Of Cocktails. On The One Evening We Had Dinner In The Bistro We Had A Champagne Cocktail And Whisky And Mixer Worth Somewhere Over Â£30 For Both And We Were Not Served Any Canapes With Our Drinks. In Such A Hotel And Paying Premium Prices For Drinks We Had Expected To Be Served Some Nibbles. We Were Told This Was Only As Part Of Dining In The Edwardian. I Think You Might Reconsider This  Even If Its Just Peanuts!,,,,,
,1867,Perhaps To Much Beef On The Grill Menu  But My Husband Was In Heaven.,,,,,
,1868,Would Have Liked To Have Tried The Edwardian Grill  Although The Bistro Was Good Not A Huge Selection.,,,,,
,1869,We Ate Out In The Evening As On Checking The Menu On The Internet Before The Visit  The Edwardian Menu For The Evening Dinner Did Not Hold Enough Variety  Lots Of Fish And Beef Dishes But Not One Poultry Or Game Dish.  Not A Complaint Just A Comment For Your Information.,,,,,
,1872,Lovely Dinning But If You Have A Dress Code It Should Be Inforced - Jeans In The Main Restaurant Were Listed As A 'No  No' But There Were A Large Party Wearing Jeans.  You State Smart - No Jeans - It Is Insulting To Those Who Adhere To The Dress Code I Will Not Mention The Bistro As They Were Obviously Having A Bad Night And The Service/Quality Of Food Was Not In Accordance With What Would Be Expected With The Venue As A Whole.,,,,,
,1873,We Were Looking Forward To Dining In The Castle Bistro In The Evening As We Had On Our Previous Stay In November 2010. Unfortunately It Was Closed From 5.30Pm Which Was A Bit Of A Disappointment.  We Understand The Reason Though As The Hotel Was Very Quiet.,,,,,
,1874,I Would Have Preferred A Policy Of No Under 16S In The Edwardian Room Beyond 8Pm,,,,,
,1875,Again Your Staff Were First Class  Attentive But Not Intrusive  Our Waitress At Dinner Was Especially Attentive As Was The Bars Manager.,,,,,
,1877,Would Have Liked A Few More Choices On Castle Menu --- Salads  Steak  Sausage/Mash And Perhaps A Choice Of Other Than Chips (Nice As They Were) And Lighter Puddings. Having Said That  My Husband Really Enjoyed The Antipasto Starter.,,,,,
,1879,Really Enjoyed The Food. The Resaurant Was Relatively Empty But That Didnt Detract From The Our Enjoyment. The Sommelier Was Extreamly Informative And Happy To Discuss Local Wines And Vinyards. We Appreiated This.,,,,,
,1881,The Breakfast Was Especially Good. Amazing Dried Fruits And Local Bacon  Sausages Etc. Just Loved It.,,,,,
,1885,Very Comfortable  Friendly And Pleasant,,,,,
,1898,The Menu Was Limited And Lacking Imagination With Beef Dominating /Limiting The Choices. The Food Was Presented Well And Tasted Very Good. I Had A Steak Which I Found Enormous And Too Thick So That The Interior Was Too Rare. Smaller 'Ladies' Portions Might Be Offered As Is The Custom In America. I Was Unable To Enjoy Sweet Or Cheese Courses As A Result. The Breakfast Offered Good Choice But The Bacon Was Cold And Hard To The Point Of Being Inedible...It Seemed To Have Been Cooked Much Earlier And Then Left In A Warmer To Dry Out.Staff Were Very Nice And Efficient And Worked Hard To Please,,,,,
,1899,We Had Dinner At 7.30 - There Were Still A Number Of Noisy Children Around At This Time Which Meant I Rated The Atmosphere Of The Dining Experience A Little Lower.,,,,,
,1900,Restaurant Lacks A Little Intimacy And Atmosphere.  Slightly Disappointed At Having To Ask For Extra Bread During The Meal; It Could Have Been Left With Us. Complaints Made By Another Customer Sat Nearby During The Meal Were Highly Irritating And Sadly Impacted Negatively Upon The Enjoyment Of Our Meal; Our Perception Was That We Were Secondary To Staff Attending To This Other Customer In Order To Satisfy Her At The Expense Of Other Customers. Need To Consider/Apologise To Other Customers When Dealing With Awkward Customers!,,,,,
,1901,In Hindsight I Wish We Had Dined In The Edwardian Grill  Which Was Offered To Us On Arrival.,,,,,
,1903,I Wish I Was Still There.,,,,,
,1905,The Food Was First Class In All Aspects From The Edwardian Grill To Room Service.,,,,,
,1906,Great Wine List ;),,,,,
,1907,Mouth Watering Food Served With Pure Class.,,,,,
,1908,Truly Fantastic Food & A Wonderful Selection.,,,,,
,1911,Good Service,,,,,
,1912,Staff Were Attentive When Dining  But Slow In Taking Order.,,,,,
,1917,Steak Was Under Cooked. I Know A Medium Rare Steak An I Got A Rare Steak. Quite Happy To Eat It Rare Just Would Of Preferred It Medium Rare. ( And Yes I Have Been A Chef),,,,,
,1918,I Found The Menu  Especially In The Castle Bistro Very Limited.  The Food Was Good And The Service Was Personal And Warm.,,,,,
,1919,The Above Only Relates To Edwardian Grill As I Was Disappointed With The Castle Bistro,,,,,
,1920,Again  The Food And Beverage Team Were Superb. Friendly  Professional  Attentive But Not Intrusive. All Great Qualities In A Team. I Particularly Liked The Way That All The Tables For Two Were Kept Together As Couples Don't Want To Be Near Bigger Parties. It Was A Well Planned Layout And Attractive Dã©Cor. The Quality Of The Food Was Excellent  The Food Was Hot And The Wine List Was Extensive.,,,,,
,1922,We Were Going To Choose From The Seasonal Menu But The Main Menu Was So Tempting. Love David's New Bin End Section Of The Wine List!,,,,,
,1925,The Food Was Delicious And Presented Beautifully  The Waiting Staff Were Extremely Helpful And Tended To My Every Need  I Don't Think My Glass Was Empty Once!!,,,,,
,1927,Very Relaxed & Informal,,,,,
,1928,The Food At The Edwardian Grill Was Absolutely Beautiful. We Thoroughly Enjoyed Every Course And The Service Was Excellent. Couldn't Fault The Dining Experience.,,,,,
,1929,The Main Dining Hall Felt Very Big! The Piano In The Background Was Lovely But When The Piano Wasn't Being Played  You Could Really Hear Other Conversations As Quite An Echo In The Room  Ambient Music Would Have Been Nice. Our Meal Was Outstanding  The Venison Wellington Was Delicious. It Would Have Been Good To Have Had More Of A Selection For The Continental Breakfast  The 'Buffet' Table Didn't Look Very Appealing  I Was Looking Forward To Warm Croissants And Home Made Jams Etc.,,,,,
,1931,Was Expensive Compared To Local Competition Which Also Provided High Quality Food,,,,,
,1932,The Room Was A Little Too Warm.,,,,,
,1933,The Food That We Ate In A Private Dining Room On The First Night Of Our Stay Was Very Poor And Not Very Good Value For Money. The Food We Had At The Wedding  Which Was Beef Fillet Was Excellent But The Amount Of Food Would Not Even Feed A Small Mouse. I Had To Return To The Lodge For A Sandwhich.,,,,,
,1934,The Starters Were Very Good And Well Presented. The Mains Were Average. We Were Told It Was A Seasonal Menu Yet There Is Only Beef Or Fish  There Is No Game Or Other Meats To Choose From  Yet In The Bistro We Later Found Out There Was A Choice Of Pheasant & Venison. To Be Given The Same Canapes 2 Evenings In A Row Is Not Good.  If You Aspire To Be Of A Standard Such As Gilpin Lodge  Lake District Or Swinton Park  North Yorkshire Where We Have Stayed Several Times  Then You Need To Improve Your Menu Choices  Standard And Presentation Of The Mains,,,,,
,1936,All Of The Scores For 14 Relate To The Edwardian Grill. Our Meal In The Bistro Was Very Poor  Menu Limited.Staff Indifferent   Table And Floor Dirty.,,,,,
,1937,All Very Nice Very Quick & Hot !,,,,,
,1940,Web Site Needs To Give Indication Of Prices Against Say A Sample Menu.English Was Poor For One Or Two Of The Staff Although They Were At Least Abe To Go And Ask Questions And Then Relay The Answers To Usoverall We Thought The Meal Was Very Good.Didn't Have Chance To Try Bistro But The Friends We Were With Stayed An Extra Night And Were Very Complimentary,,,,,
,1941,Great Food. We Had 65 In Our Party And To Cater To Such A High Standard For This Amount Of People Was A Great Achievment.,,,,,
,1944,There Was A Delay Of Some 40 Minutes  Presumably Due To The Fact That It Was Mother's Day,,,,,
,1946,The Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful.  It Was A Nice Touch To Be Able To Buy Chocolates.,,,,,
,1947,Wine Pricey Even For Run Of Mill Wines,,,,,
,1957,The Service In The Bistro Was Not As Good As Everywhere Else. It Was Nice  But Not As Good As The Service We Had Come To Expect From The Rest Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,1961,Waiting Staff Need Better Training.,,,,,
,1964,Edwardian Grill Was Great  But Bistro Was Not Good Enough For Such A Great Location. Would Have Enjoyed A Higher Quality Food In The Bistro - A Bit Overpriced For The Quality Provided.,,,,,
,1966,The Food Was Very Good  The Service Was Slightly Less Profesional Than I Would Have Expected At Such A Venue.,,,,,
,1968,Staff Were Great But Restaurant Was Very Quiet So Atmosphere Suffered Slightly,,,,,
,1970,I Feel The Experience Was Overpriced. Had To Wait Some Time For Menus And To Order. Our Table Was A Temporary Banqueting Table So 2 Of Us Were Unable To Place Our Legs Fully Under The Table. Starters Were Fine. Pastry On The Beef Wellington Was Soggy. Our Table Was Booked At 9Pm And We Didn't Get Our Main Courses Until Just Before 11Pm So Too Late For Desserts. No Enquiry From Staff As To Our Satisfaction During The Meal So We Were Unable To Comment To Them.,,,,,
,1972,Absolutely Superb!,,,,,
,1974,Dinner Was Completely Amazing In The Edwardian Grill  Breakfast Was Bountiful And With Plenty Of Options.  Lunch In The Oak Bar Was Very Enjoyable.,,,,,
,1976,We Tried The Bistro On Two Occasions - We Weren't Particularly Impressed The First Time But On The Second Occasion (Lunch On A Saturday)  The Menu Was Better And The Food Was Lovely.  As Far As The Edwardian Grill Goes  We Celebrated My Birthday By Eating Here.  The Service Was Slow Between Starter And Main.  Although The Food Was Very Nice  It Wasn't Value For Money With A Meal For Two Adults And A Child Amounting To Just Shy Of Â£200!  We Didn't Feel The Experience Was Worth That.,,,,,
,1979,The Partition Blinds In The Dining Room Were Not Inkeeping With The Decor,,,,,
,1982,Excellent Service And Amazing Food. 5 Stars,,,,,
,1984,The Bistro Is Essentially A Cafe.  The Edwardian Grill Was Disappointing.  There Was Little Choice In Food Between Pizza Or Foie Gras.  Despite Some Staff Being Very Helpful  Others Did Not Appear To Know What They Were Doing  How To Serve  What They Were Serving.  I Would Suggest Training Is Much In Need.  Quality Certainly Did Not Reflect Price,,,,,
,1985,My Husband Said It Was The Best Steak He'd Ever Had.,,,,,
,1986,The Breakfast On Sunday Morning Was Disappointing. The Bacon Was So Overdone One Couldnt Cut Through It And The Black Pudding Was Very Fatty. We Stayed At The Three Crowns In Chagford The Evening Before (For Â£75 B&B) And The Breakfast There Was Alot Better. We Don't Like To Complain But Feel You Should Be Made Aware Of This. Such A Shame As Everything Else Was Great.,,,,,
,1988,We Did Have A Reservation At The Restaurant But Cancelled It Because We Were The Only Booking And The Room Was Very Quiet. Maybe A Little Low Music Even At Breakfast Would Help This.,,,,,
,1990,Had A Promotional Voucher To Stay Here  It Was Not Made Clear That We Had Â£30 Towards The Meal Per Person In The Edwardian Grill So A Suprise To See The Bill Cost !,,,,,
,1993,I Didn't Enjoy The Food Very Much And Would Definitely Like To Dine In The Grill Or Bistro The Next Time,,,,,
,1995,The Quality Was Excellent And There Was One Waitress Who Helped Us With Our Son A Lot During Our Dinner In The Edwardian Grill On Monday Evening However The Speed Of Service Generally Throughout Our Stay Was Very Poor. It Would Take An Age For Someone To Come To Take Our Order On Numerous Occasions  And At Breakfast By The Time We Got Toast And Milk For Our Coffee We Were Almost Finished With Our Cooked Breakfast.  We Were Also Seated At The Same Table For Breakfast As We Had For Our Evening Meal And The Food That Had Been Dropped By Our 1 Year Old Was Still There  Not What I Would Expect From A No Frills Hotel Let Alone An Establishment Such As Bovey Tracey. Finally On The Day Of Our Departure The Receptionist Kindly Arranged For Our Baby's Bottles To Be Washed However After Several Hours And 3 Requests For Their Return We Had To Leave Without Them.,,,,,
,1999,Only Able To Eat In The Edwardian Grill Due To Lack Of Guest On Night.,,,,,
,2004,We Felt That If There Was Anything Negative About Our Stay Was The Quality Of The Food. We Would Expect An Slh To Have Better Meals,,,,,
,2005,There Were A Lot Of Children Staying  It Would Be Nice If Families Ate At An Earlier Time. E.G. Adults Only After 8Pm.  And I Could Have Done With Slightly Bigger Portions.,,,,,
,2010,We Thought The Edwardian Grill Was Better Value For Money Than The Bistro. Would Have Loved More Vegetables When We Ate In The Bistro.,,,,,
,2012,Their Were Dirty Spoons Under The Table.  Half The Flowers On The Table Were Dead.  The Waiter's Wore Dirty Food Stained Waitcoats!  Room Service Order On The First Evening Disappeared.  Wrong Tea Served.,,,,,
,2014,The Breakfast Was Fine  Afternoon Tea Was Perfect.  However On Both Nights We Found The Food To Be Below Standard Quality.  The Hog Roast Was As Tough As Old Boots And The Pave Steak The Following Evening Was Equally As Tough  I Gave Up Trying To Cut The Meat!   A Real Shame As The Rest Of The Weekend Was Excellent.,,,,,
,2016,Deserts Would Only Get 8 Out Of 10,,,,,
,2017,All The Food And Drink  And The Service  Was Great. The Only Points Worthy Of Further Comment Are The (Sour Dough?) Bun With The Bistro Burger Was A Little 'Tough' And One Of The Bistrio Waiters Was A Little Over-Enthusiastic In Clearing The Plates,,,,,
,2018,The Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,2020,The Starter Was Outstanding As Was The Dessert  However We Both Felt The Main Course (Chicken Burger & The Steak Burger ) Were Fairly Mediocre.,,,,,
,2021,Bistro Menu Was A Bit Limited,,,,,
,2023,Wedding Dinner Was Superb.,,,,,
,2026,The Staff Were Not Very Efficient Or Attentive In The Edwardian Grill And Oak Bar Both At Dinner And Breakfast.  We Sometimes Struggled To Get Noticed.,,,,,
,2033,The Restaurant Did Feel A Little Quiet And Not Very Cosy. I Think This May Be Because It Is So Large.,,,,,
,2035,Food Was A Little Disappointing Compared To Everything Else At The Hotel,,,,,
,2036,The Chateau Briand Was A Little Tough And Under Cooked For Medium Rare- The Staff Were Wonderful.,,,,,
,2037,Service In The Bistro Was Very Slow,,,,,
,2039,I Was Disappointed That My Daughter's Food Intolerances  Which I Notified In Advance  Were Not Catered For Nearly As Well As They Had Been Last Year At Christmas.,,,,,
,2041,Service In The Oak Bar And The Castle Bistro Was Excellent And Unobtrusive. We Also Took Afternoon Tea  The Service Was Rather Slow To Start With  Infact The Tea Got Cold Before We Were Served Any Food. Breakfast Was A Bit Hit And Miss  I Asked For Cream With My Coffee And Got Hot Milk. We Were Asked If We Would Like Brown Or White Toast  We Asked For Brown And Received N Toast At All.,,,,,
,2043,The Description Of A Pasta Dish Failed To Mention Smoked Paprika That Had A Strong And Distinctive Flavour That Was A Surprise And Not To My Wife's Taste  Burger Very Nice But Chips Not Good  Mango Cheese Cake Was Disappointing,,,,,
,2044,The Waiter From Mauritius Was Excellent  Can't Remember His Name!,,,,,
,2045,Food Was Ok A Little Bland  We Will Try The Bistro Next Time.,,,,,
,2046,Everything Was Excellent,,,,,
,2048,The Breakfast Room Is Too Small For The Amount Of Guests That Were Staying. We Had To Wait Over 20 Minutes The First Day To Be Seated And 10 Minutes The Second Day. If You Took Out The Sofas You Would Be Able To Put More Tables In The Room.,,,,,
,2049,Venue Was Excellent  Food Average.,,,,,
,2051,The Evening Meal Was A Very Good Experience However The Breakfast Seemed To Be Understaffed. We Had To Wait Some Time To Be Seated And Several Minutes For Plates Before We Could Serve Ourselves At The Buffet. We Were Also Disappointed In The Quality Of The Bread For The Toast.,,,,,
,2052,The Breakfast Could Have Been Better.  The Food Was Cold And We Were Not Sure Whether We Were Supposed To Help Ourselves To The Cooked Breakfast Or If We Should Wait For Our Order To Be Taken.  The Service In The Evening Was Much Better.  We Were Surprised We Were Charged A Service Charge For The Dining As Well As The Overall Service Charge,,,,,
,2055,Wasnt Made To Feel Special And No Real Sense Of A Maitre'd Who Was Looking After Everyone's Interestst,,,,,
,2056,We Dined Both In The Bistro And The Dining Room  Excellent On Both Occasions.,,,,,
,2061,We Had To Wait For Our Wine To Be Served With Our Main Course As We Had Only Ordered A Glass Each And Had To Remind The Staff Of Our Order,,,,,
,2063,Restaurant Staff Were Excellent. Wine List Very Good But Could Have Done With A Few Slightly Lower Priced Wines.,,,,,
,2067,Perhaps A Bit More Info On The Menu About The Food - Terrine With Anchovis For Example  It Should Say They Are Sour And Not Salt Like We Expected,,,,,
,2068,Staff Seemed A Bit Scruffy On Our 1St Day And Two Seemed They Could Not Be Bothered To Work,,,,,
,2073,Bizarre Vegetarian Choice For The Xmas Meal.,,,,,
,2074,Thoroughly Enjoyed The Food At My Sisters Wedding Meal And The Breakfast The Next Day.,,,,,
,2075,Relaxed Atmosphere  Attentive Staff  Fantastic Food.,,,,,
,2076,Wonderful Ambience  Especially With The Candlelight And Pianist,,,,,
,2079,We Only Ate Inn The Bistro And I Was Dissapointed With The Main Course: The Steak Burger Was Simply A Basic Burger And Was Nothing Special. The Wine Was Very Good Though!,,,,,
,2082,My Partners Steak Had To Be Sent Back Twice  I Had Then Finished My Meal And My Partner Ended Up Not Eating A Main Course. Chips Were Not Replaced Either.,,,,,
,2089,Grill And Bar Was Far More Decadent Than The Bistro Which Felt A Little Cheap.,,,,,
,2091,The Room Is Beautiful.  I Appreciate The Upgrade For The More Casual Dining Area Menu.  Great.  Sad To Report Both Mornings  My Husband Had To Send His Breakfast Back Three Times. The Order Was Incorrect .  The Staff Is So Sweet However.,,,,,
,2092,The Food In The Bistro (Mushroom Risotto) Had No Taste At All  Very Disappointing.  Having Breakfast The Next Morning  My Wife Had Half An Eggshell In A Poached Egg And The Full English Breakfast Was A Little Sparse.  The Buffet Was Nice Though.  All In All We Were Put Off Coming Visiting For The Food Alone.,,,,,
,2095,Absolutely Outstanding Although Due To Bad Weather Menu Was Unchanged For Dinner On 3Rd Night From The Day Before,,,,,
,2096,Very Impressive  Also Lovely Dining Room  Not Used To Such Grandeur (And Expense) But Didn't Feel Uncomfortable And It Didn't Disappoint As A Special Treat.,,,,,
,2098,This I Could Not Fault - Our Table At The Wedding Was One Of The Last To Be Served/Cleared But You Never Felt You Were Waiting - It Was All Top Class - Well Done.,,,,,
,2099,Again Service Was Efficient And Friendly.,,,,,
,2100,The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent However The Castle Bistro Felt You Had Walked Into A Completely Different Hotel And Not In A Positive Respect. The Menu Was Extremely Limiting Our Meal Was Not Good And The Surroundings Felt Cheap With Terrible Background Music. Service As Usual For The Hotel Very Good But Would Never Done There Again.,,,,,
,2101,The Food Was Delicious And Quite Stunning To Look At! Perhaps Very Fractionally Increased Portions Might Work! (Fully Understand That A Plate-Full Is Not The Idea Here! So Don't Read Too Much Into This!) It Was A Lovely Dining Experience.,,,,,
,2102,Very Knowledgeable And Friendly Sommelier Lady,,,,,
,2104,The First Evening We Dinned In The Bistro And Were Very Disappointed In The Quality Of The Food. The Second Evening We Dinned In The Edwardian Grill Were The Food Quality And Service Were Excellent.,,,,,
,2107,Very Pleased With The Service And The Quality Of The Food  Breakfasts Could Be Improved With More Fresh Fruits And Muesli Choices.,,,,,
,2108,Would Recommend To Everyone,,,,,
,2114,The Food Is Better Than The Lord Poulett Arms!,,,,,
,2118,The Dinning Experience Was First Class.,,,,,
,2119,Light Background Music In The Dinning Room Would Have Been Nice ,,,,,
,2120,Breakfast Isn't Great. In A Hotel Of That Standard I Would Expect To Order Hot Food From A Menu Rather Than Have A Buffet Which Wasn't Very Nice.  The Additional Â£15 For Ordering From A Menu Is Excessive,,,,,
,2121,Excellent Cheese Board  The Best I Have Ever Had And L Love Smoked Haddock At Breakfast,,,,,
,2122,We Were Suprised To Find Such A Contrast When We Walked Into The Bistro From The Main Building.We Thought It Worked Very Well And Gave An Excellent Vibe And Place To Be And To Eat In A Relaxed Atmosphere. ,,,,,
,2123,Best Dining I Have Enjoyed For A Long Time. The Whole Experience Was Fantastic!,,,,,
,2124,The Staff Need To Gain Some Training In The Making Of Irish Coffees!,,,,,
,2125,The Ice Cream Was Still Deeply Frozen When It Arrived.  The Key To The Wine Cellar Had Been Mis-Placed  So We Could Only Order House Wines.,,,,,
,2126,I Ordered Beef Wellington And It Was Very Expensive However Had Clearly Been Cooked Earlier And Warmed Up... Pastry Was Soggy And Meat Which I Admit I Had Asked For Rare Was Barely Wwarm In The Middle. However It Was Also V Dry Indicating The Juices Had Probably Leaked Away When Previously Cooked. Not Really Acceptable For A Good Restaurant!,,,,,
,2128,My Disappointment Over The Service In The Edwardian Grill On Wednesday Evening Have Been Raised With Mr Aresti Who Is Addressing My Concerns. Otherwise  The Service Was Excellent,,,,,
,2129,Did Not Need Cream Added To The Cabbage. Mushrooms Too Large For Breakfast. Chilli Sauce To Strong With The Smoked Duck.,,,,,
,2130,Liver And Bacon Main Course And Prawn Starter Was Excellent. Limited Selection Of Desserts And The Bread And Butter Pudding Was Particularly Bland And Appeared To Be Heated In A Microwave.,,,,,
,2132,The Service In The Edwardian Restaurant Was Very Slow Especially As There Were Very Few Diners In The Restaurant We Waited Over 30 Minutes Just To Have Our Order Taken. However The Staff Were Very Friendly And Pleasant.,,,,,
,2133,Again Both Restaurants Were Slow And At Breakfast Even Worse!!,,,,,
,2134,The Food Was Amazing And Cooked To Perfection For All Of The Wedding Guests.,,,,,
,2135,We Were Very Well Looked After.,,,,,
,2136,As Discussed With Federico  We Had A Major Issue With Meal At Castle Bistro. We Arrived At 730Pm To Be Informed That Due To 1/2 Term The Kitchen Was Very Busy And There Would Be A Long Wait For Food. The Bistro Was Probably 75% Full. The Staff Seemed A Little Inexperienced In Generally Serving Us  And Certainly Not Enable To Communicate With The Kitchen. This Was Resolved Only When Federico Stepped In. Having Been Informed Of This Delay  We Were Offered No Bread  Bread Sticks Etc..Drinks Took A While To Arrive. Then We Started To Ask For Delivery (Kids Playing Up- Say 30-40 Mins) We Were Served A Pizza That Wasnt Cooked Properly  And Also Fresh Pasta That Was Stuck Together In Lumps Because We Were Told It Had Been Frozen. This Dish We Sent Back  Only For The Replacement To Have The Exact Same Problem. We Were Told Latterly The Pasta Supplier Was Going To Be Changed. Our Bill Was Waived Which Was A Kind Gesture  But We Also Noticed Problems With Other Guests In The Bistro Too.,,,,,
,2137,We Thought The Food Edwardian Grill Was V Nice And Inventive. Sometimes The Odd Flavour Combinations Didn't Work V Well  But The Innovation And Creativity Made It Very Worthwhile. There Was Obviously A Lot Of Thought Into It. We Also Ate At The Castle Bistro; Here We Were Not Impressed. The Food Was Average  At Best. The Atmosphere And The Music Did Not Fit The Rest Of The Castle  And Brought It Down In Our Opinion. This Was Really Not Up To Scratch With The Rest Of The Castle  And The Price.  The Only Other Suggestion We Have Is That We Would Have Liked To Eat Our Snacks (Ordered In The Bistro) In The Oak Bar Instead. We Were Very Comfortable There  Had Nice Cocktails And Wine  And Really Didn't Want To Leave To Go To The Bistro To Eat Something. But We Were Told That No Food Was Served In The Oak Bar After 6Pm. We Strongly Recommend This Is Changed; After We Upped And Left And Had A Below Average Meal At The Bistro We Retired  As Opposed To Having Hung Out At The Bar For The Rest Of The Evening.   ,,,,,
,2138,Service In The Castle Bistro Was A Little Slow This Time Compared To Previous Visits.  Would Have Loved To Eat In The Edwardian Grill In The Evenings  However We Had Our Niece With Us And As It Didnt Open Until 7 This Was Not Possible,,,,,
,2139,No,,,,,
,2140,I Thought The Dining Options Were A Little Limited For Children. The Edwardian Grill  Although It Looked Delicious  Did Not Have A Menu Suitable For Children. The Castle Bistro Menu Was Limited And Didn't Have Standard Items Such As Simple Sandwiches On It. I Think This Could Be Improved Or Introduce A Lounge Menu With Light Bites / Sandwiches For People To Enjoy In The Bar Or The Main Public Rooms. Had We Been Staying A Third Day We Would Have Had To Go Out To Get Some Variety Which I Really Didn't Want To Do  I Came To Bovey To Stay There And Relax.,,,,,
,2144,Becca 'Made' Our Evening Meals Special. She Was Always Bubbly  Chatty And Seemed Nto Always Be So Happy. Something Not Everyone Can Do Continuously. Our Children Loved To Come And Buy Ice Creams From Her After Swimming As She Always Had A Joke With Them. Lovely Girl. Rachel Too Was Also Always Happy To Do Anything For Us. Great Atmosphere In The Bistro.,,,,,
,2145,A Slightly Larger Portion For Evening Meals Would Be Lovely.,,,,,
,2146,On Our First Night We Ate At The Bistro - The Fish And Chips Were Overcooked As Were The Chips Which Accompanied A Very Salty Gammon Steak  But Our Daughters' Meals (Mussels And Pizza Respectively) Were Excellent And The Final Night Meal At The Edwardian Grill Was Truly Excellent,,,,,
,2150,The Bistro Was Very Chaotic On Our First Evening But As A Result The Manager Kindly Did Not Charge Us For Our Drinks Which Was A Lovely Gesture Although I Had Already Pre-Paid For The Grill Which Was Far More Expensive!,,,,,
,2158,As Bovey Is Already Aware  In The Edwardian Grill We Ordered An Entree Each And Bottle Of Wine- It Took Over Two Hours.. I Dont Mind Pouring Water Myself But The Wine Should Be Attended To- In This Case It Was Poured One Time. The Waiter(S) Dissappreared. No One Came Over To Inquire 'How Is Everything' After Our Entree Was Served. One Gets This Question Even In The Most Local Of Pubs! No One Cleared  Offered Dessert Menus  Coffee  After Dinner Drinks  The Check? I Got Up And Walked Out. Nice 30Th Anniversary Dinner Experience There. The Castle Bistro Was Fine Good Burgers But Have To Say The Design & Deco Are Cold  Uncomfortable &  Bizarre And The Music Blaring Is Unforgiveable. The Oak Bar Was Sublime The Blond Bartender An Absolute Delight Friendly Helpful  Willing  If Overtaxed- I Think He Needs More Hands To Help. Afternoon Tea In There Also Took A While. The Tea Itself Was Just Ok.,,,,,
,2160,Restaurant Was Excellent And Bistro Well Priced,,,,,
,2161,We Ate Lunch In The Bistro Which Was Fine But We Were Rather Disappointed With The Food In The Edwardian Grill - It Does Not Compare To The Devonshire At Bolton Abbey. Also As We Ate Two Nights In The Grill It Was Disappointing To Have Exactly The Same Menu Both Nights - No Change In The Menu At All  Even The Pre-Dinner 'Amuse-Bouche' Was The Same. Breakfast Was Very Good.,,,,,
,2163,Very Good Ambience,,,,,
,2164,I Had To Ask What Some Of The Items Were On The Menu,,,,,
,2165,We Had 'Young' To Dinner One Night  And It Was Good To Have An Informal Place To Eat; We Actually Ate In The Cathedral Room  Which Was Magical!  We Would Have Eaten In The Bistro  But As It Was A Weekday It Was Not Open In The Evening.  One Might Add An Extra 'Proper'dish To The  Bar Menu Such As A Casserole Of Some Sort; A Lot Of The Menu Was Sandwiches Etc And Our Guests Needed Something More Fortifying.,,,,,
,2166,We Loved The Dã©Cor Of The Private Party Room  The Attentive Service  Delicious Food And Being Able To Hear That Marvellous Pianist.   Breakfast Was Excellent On Sunday Too.,,,,,
,2167,On My First Evening I Dined Alone In One Of The Private Dining Rooms As The Main Restaurant Was Taken Over My A Murder Mystery Evening.  There Was A Slight Mix-Up Over The Table That I Had Chosen.  Apart From That All Was Fine.,,,,,
,2168,On Our First Evening We Couldn't Get A Seat In The Oak Bar So Were Shown To The Lounge And Our Drinks Were Served. We Were Given Drinks Menus But After A Period Of Time I Had To Go And Request The Dinner Menus. After A Further Period Of Time I Had To Go And Find Someone To Come And Take Our Order As It Appeared That We Had Been Forgotten. Also There Were Times When The Service At Breakfast Was Slow.,,,,,
,2169,Menu In Castle Bistro Very Limited - Not As Shown On The Internet.  Had To Dine In The Edwardian Grill And Most Of The Steaks Were Tough.  (We Had Originally Booked The Castle Bistro Along With Our 4 Friends),,,,,
,2171,Wedding Food = Excellent.  Bistro Food - Good.,,,,,
,2173,The Only Slight Let Down Was How Long We Had To Wait For Both Our Lunchtime And Evening Meals At The Castle Bistro But We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Food And The Staff Were Very Friendly And Attentive.,,,,,
,2175,My Third Time Eating At Bovey. Once Again  Very Bland Tastes  & Limited Menu. Probably Last Time I Eat There. Shame.,,,,,
,2176,You Could Surely Do Better At The Bistro Cuisine With Little Effort. You Must Do Something About The Smell And Odour. It Is Not Acceptable For A House Of Your Standard That The Greater Area Smells Of Kitchen. From Watching The Service Processes: Everybody Is Busy And There Are Many Around. I Strongly Advise A Process Analysis. The Inefficiency I Watched Is Simply A Matter Of Process Design.,,,,,
,2177,The Food Was Good  Though Not Outstanding. The Staff Were Very Pleasant And Wanting To Please But Not Very Efficient,,,,,
,2180,Lacking Direction. Wine List Needs Up-Dating ! Food Very Average .,,,,,
,2181,Nice To Eat In A Restaurant Where The Tables Aren't Too Close Together.,,,,,
,2182,It Would Have Been Good To Have Been Told There Was A Function In The Edwardian Restaurant On Friday 13 We Came To Dinner But Decided To Dine The Next Night Instead When We Saw The Edwardian Was Not Available - No Problem Though As We Went To The Pub Instead And The Situatopn Was Handled Very Well Indeed,,,,,
,2185,Very Relaxed Atmosphere With Excellent Food,,,,,
,2186,The Rating Above Relates To The Edwardian Grill Where We Were Attended Extremely Well.  Full Marks To All The Staff There.  We Also Ate In The Castle Bistro Where We Found Alas  Both The Food And Staff Not Quite Worthy Of Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,2187,I Have Never Had A Sirloin Steak So Grisily  But To Be Fair It Was Changed As Soon As I Spoke To The Waiter,,,,,
,2189,Lovely Staff  Especially Ionatzs? Johnny (James Bond) And Adam My Mother Really Enjoyed Her Anniversary Treat,,,,,
,2191,Lovely Venue For A Special Celebration  Whatever The Occasion It Is Always Memorable.,,,,,
,2192,Please Offer Normal Hen Eggs. Ducks Eggs Are Disgusting. Some Personnel Was Unfriendly  The Portions Of Salad Were Extra Miserable  The Soups Seem To Come Out Of The Bag  Poor Menu Options In The Castle Bistro.,,,,,
,2193,Your Literature Clearly Tells Guests 'No Denins' In The Edwardian  But Some Wore Them Anyways And The Staff Allowed Them To Do So.  One Man Even Wore Shorts Into Dinner One Evening. Also  Some Parents Were Allowing Their Children To Run A Bit Wild. All Of These People Should Have Been Redirected To The Castle Bistro  Or Failing That  They Should Be Restricted To The First Seating Area By The Entrance. This Really Did Distract From The Dining Experience At The Edwardian.,,,,,
,2195,For Guests Staying Very Good As You Know Everything Is Freshly Prepared.  You Accept That This Maybe A More Expensive Meal Than An External Restaurant.  As A 'Dining Venue' For Non-Resident Guests It Is More Expensive And Would Be Used For An 'Occasion' More Than Casual Dining.,,,,,
,2196,Full English Breakfast Was Disappointing. Fried Egg Was Hard. Very Small Portions.  Evening Meal In Bistro Was Not That Good. Would Have Preferred Triple Cooked Chunky Chips. Mushy Peas Were Only Luke Warm. Sticky Toffee Pud Was Rather Doughy And Clotted Cream Was A Very Small Portion. Cheesecake Was Bland With Very Small Portion Of Clotted Cream.,,,,,
,2197,No Everything Was Fine,,,,,
,2198,Wonderful Food And Service.  The Only Slight Issue I Had Was That There Were A Number Of Children In The Restaurant Crawling Under Their Chairs  Playing On Game Consoles Etc. I Understand That Bovey Is Very Inclusive And I Love This Aspect  But Maybe For Such A Restaurant There Could Be A Rule Where Children Only Eat In There From 6-8? After All There Is The Bistro. I Understand They Should Be Allowed To Eat With Their Families Wherever They Like But It Just Means The Overall Atmosphere Was A Little Strained As I Could See Other Diners Becoming Irritated By The Noise. It Didn't Quite Feel As Special As Perhaps It Could Have Done.,,,,,
,2199,We Had Very High Expectations Of The Edwardian Grill Dinner Service. The Service Was Very Good  We Were Well Looked After  However There Were A Few Mistakes Which Unfortunately Did Not Make The Service Flawless.  The Wrong Year Of The Wine Was Firstly Brought Out  Then The Steak Was Overcooked. It Was Returned And Redelivered Very Quickly However So I Cannot Fault That.  All In All Very Impressed But Disappointed Mostly With An Overcooked Steak  Particularly As My Partner Commented On Ordering That This Must Certainly Be A Place Where They Cook Steak To Perfection!,,,,,
,2200,Sprouts Too Hard Cod A Bit Cold Otherwise Excellent,,,,,
,2202,Our Daughter Is Getting Married In 2014 And We Would Be Very Happy For Her Guests To Share The Experience We Had At Bovey Castle. We Will Recommend It To Her.,,,,,
,2206,The Edwardian Grill Was Our Only Option For Dining As The Bistro Was Closed During Our Stay. There Were Very Few Guests And So The Atmosphere In The Dining Room Was Not Very Welcoming. The Room Also Felt A Little Stuffy. It Would Have Been Great To Have Been Given The Option To Dine In Any Other Of The Rooms Infront Of The Fire.,,,,,
,2209,The Food (And Staff In The Restaurant And Bar) Was Great  A Real High Point Of Our Stay,,,,,
,2221,Above Is For The Restaurant  Service In The Bistro Was Appaling!,,,,,
,2223,Very Professional And Welcoming Waitress,,,,,
,2228,If We Lived Nearer We Would Use Just For Dining As Well.,,,,,
,2229,Meal On First Night Great.......Second Night It Was A Shambles.....Steak Was Cremated ....Three Times Cooked Chips Were The Dregs Of The Fryer.......Steak Sauce Was A Teaspoon Full.......Not Happy With Food Bearing In Mind How Expensive It Was......Breakfast Was Fine,,,,,
,2231,Breakfast Was A Little Befuddled At Times But It May Have Been Because There Were So Many Of Us Coming And Going Which Confused The Staff. I Didn't Really Care As I Was There To Relax - Not To Make A Fuss. The Staff Are Lovely  Pleasant And Obliging. All My Crazy Allergies And Food Intolerances Were Catered For - Brilliant.,,,,,
,2232,Excellent Wine List  Sommelier Was Very Helpful,,,,,
,2233,Having Both Formal And Less Formal Dining Areas Gives The Diner Choice Which Is Always Nice.,,,,,
,2236,Service First Rate.  We Are Seasoned Travelers And My Wife Works In A 5* Restaurant.  There Was At No Point Anything Other Than 5* Service.  Well Done To All. Food (Steaks) Wonderful. Unfortunately As We Had Partaken Of The Afternoon Tea We Had No Room For A Starter However I Wouldn't Have Missed The Tea  Main Course Delightful  Desserts Were Sublime And The Petit Fours And Coffee The Perfect Finish.  Thankyou.,,,,,
,2239,The Maã®Tre D And Head Chef Were Very Welcoming And Spent Some Time Discussing The Menu And Approach To The Dining Experience.,,,,,
,2241,Everything Was Excellent,,,,,
,2242,The Fish My Wife Had In The Bistro Was Not Properly Cooked And Had To Be Sent Back. The Toast In The Morning Was Floppy And Appeared To Be Only Warmed Through Rather Than Cooked So That It Was Crunchy. I Specifically Asked To Have After My Bacon And Egg - It Was Brought Before.,,,,,
,2252,Not Over Faced With Food. Food Was A Bit Different And The Quality And Choice Excellent. Service Excellent  Not Rushed But Not Too Slow. Would Have Liked To Have Redbush Tea Available As Lots Of People Drink It Now. Two Out Of Four In The Dining Room At Breakfast Wanted Some But The Waitress Did Not Know It.,,,,,
,2253,The Food Was Excellent But The Service Left A Lot To Be Desired. A Wait Of Over One Hour Between The Serving Of The Starters And The Main Course Was Not Acceptable And The Wine Waiter Disappeared As Soon As The Wine Was Pouredfor The First Glass.,,,,,
,2255,I Think The Edwardian Grill Is Possibly Too Expensive For Dinner,,,,,
,2256,Food Was Beautifully Cooked,,,,,
,2257,We Have Previously Eaten In The Brasserie And Found It Good Food But Found It On Our Previous Visit Noisy As No Parental Control Of Children Running Around The Tables Making Noise-Very Off Putting. We Decided To Eat Again At The Brasserie And Found The Food Average With The Menu Very Disappointing As Is Seems You Have Made It Too Child Friendly And Not Adult Friendly- Are You Deliberately Trying To Put Adults Off From Eating In There And Eating In The Restaurant Instead? We Delayed Eating As Yet Again Loud Children So Ate Late Trying To Miss This Problem But Was Again Disturbed And This Is An Issue Which Needs Addressing As Previously We Were Told They Were Members Children So Action Could Be Taken-Why Not? The Menu Choice Was Poor With No Desert Appealing To My Wife And No Better Than A Third Rate Restaurant In Fact We Ate Better In A Pub Restaurant The Day Before-This Is The Reason Why We Will Be Looking Elsewhere On Our Next Visit To Your Area To Both Eat And Stay.,,,,,
,2258,The Restaurant Wasn't Very Busy But Most Of The Tables For Two Were Tucked Behind Columns Out Of The Way & It Just Felt As If We Weren't Important Enough To Be Out In The Main Area. It Was As Though The Main Thoroughfare Was Being Kept Clear 'In Case' Bigger Parties Came In.,,,,,
,2259,The Edwardian Dining Made A Huge Difference To Our Overall Enjoyment Of Bovey Castle . The Food Was Amazing   The Wine Waiter ( Katerina ? ) Was So Helpful And Lovely . She Is An Asset !! The Piano Player Was Great Too   He Was Not Intrusive And Played Some Lovely Pieces . This Dining Experience Changed Out Opinion Of Bovey Castle And We Would Definitely Come Back To Dine With You . Well Done Chef !!!!!!,,,,,
,2260,Staff Great. A Nice Balance And Made You Very Welcome.,,,,,
,2262,Edwardian Grill Was Fantastic: Food Was Beautifully Presented  Waiters Were Very Accommodating And Friendly  And The Food Tasted Delicious. Although  The Bistro Seemed To Let The Place Down A Bit As The Waiter Seemed Miserable  Was Quite Rude And Got Our Order Wrong.,,,,,
,2265,The Food In The Bistro Was A Little Deappointing - The Chips I Order Where Clearly Over Cooked Yet Still Serviced.   The Edwardian Was Excellent,,,,,
,2268,Food & Service Very Good  Very Impressed,,,,,
,2269,Although The Staff Were Excellent And Very Attentive  It Was Clear That There Needed To Be More Of Them! It Became Apparent Quite Quickly That You Were Under-Staffed. The Food And Wine Was Excellent. Thoroughly Enjoyable.,,,,,
,2270,Warm  Relaxed And Amazing Service By Highly Professional Staff.,,,,,
,2272,Would Like To See A More International Menu Choice In The Bistro - As A Family With Young Children We Didn't Have Any Other Dining Option Suitable To Us And Therefore Seeing The Same Menu Everyday Did Get Tedious Hence We Chose On Several Occasions To Leave The Hotel For Dinner Which We Would Have Preferred Not To Have Done As It's A Fabulous Place To Stay And Relax.,,,,,
,2274,There Were Only 5 Couples In The Restaurant And I Felt There Was Too Much Attention. Our Water Glasses Were Filled Every Few Minutes Which Was A Tiny Bit Annoying As It Broke The Conversation Each Time And Our Glasses Were Not Empty.,,,,,
,2276,The Staff In The Edwardian Grill Were Excellent And The Standard Of Service Was Very High. However  The Dining Room Was Somewhat Empty Which Meant That The Room Flet Too Big - It Was Much Better During The Bustling Breakfast Service. Also  Whilst The Food Was Nice It Wasn't Outstanding Unlike Other Areas Of The Bovey Experience And Was Quote Expensive.,,,,,
,2285,We Did Also Eat In The Bistro  Which Was Fine As A More Informal Eating Venue. Staff Were Lovely.,,,,,
,2287,This Was The Worst Hotel Food I Have Ever Had.  It Was Very Dissapointing.  Breakfast Via Room Service Was Dry And Inedible.  Bistro Food Was Nearly As Bad.,,,,,
,2288,Any Minor Complaints We Had Were Dealt With Rapidly And Without Fuss By The Staff At The Time.,,,,,
,2294,It Was Great To Have 2 Different Dining Area Options Each Night. Breakfast Very Good Too.,,,,,
,2297,Great Food And Atmosphere In The Edwardian  Service A Little Bit Slow On Sunday Lunch.,,,,,
,2301,There Were Some Small Issues That Let Down The Dining Experience. For Example  The Waiter Brought A Bottle Of Wine To Our Table But He Didn't Unscrew The Lid Or Pour Us A First Glass - And It Wasn't Particularly Busy In The Restaurant. I Would Expect The Waiter To Pour The First Glass Or Even Let Us Sample The Wine - Even In A Three Or Four Star Hotel. The Food Was Average But My Chips Were Burnt. There Was An Issue With The Lighting Too (Following A Power Cut) And The Staff Didn't Know Where The Trip Switch Was. This Meant That We Had To Eat Our First Course Pretty Much In The Dark. The Whole Experience Was Ok But Not What I Was Expect From A High-Calibre Hotel.,,,,,
,2305,The Service During Dinner Was Nor As Good As I Had Expected. We Were Kept Waiting For Some Time  Glasses Were Not Replenished When Empty.,,,,,
,2309,The Dinner Was Excellent But The Breakfast Was Not. The Bacon Was Inedible The First Day And Although We Asked For Soft Bacon The Next It Was Still Over Cooked,,,,,
,2310,On Sunday 8Th May We Asked For A Coffee At 09.20 Approx... After 10 Minutes Of Waiting We Asked Again... Then Another 5 Minutes Later I Asked For A Third Time And Explained We Were In A Hurry... After A Further 5 Minutes We Ended Up Walking Out.  We Were Really Annoyed About This And Reported It To The Lady In Charge.  On That Particular Day The Staff (Two Ladies In Particular) Were Keeping Their Heads Down I.E. Not Looking To Help Any Of The Guests And  In One Hour Of Sitting There  Not Once Did Anyone Ask Us If We Wanted Anything Nor Did They Clear Away Any Of Our Plates.  The Lady In Charge (English Lady With Short Dark Hair) Will Remember This Incident.  I Would Have Expected More From A 5 Star Hotel.,,,,,
,2312,Castle Bistro Was Excellent. Edwardian Grill Was Trying A Bit Too Hard  Good But Could Perhaps Be A Little Less Ambitious. Edwardian Grill Let Itself Down A Little By Bringing The Wrong Bottle Of Wine.,,,,,
,2313,I Would Definitely Like To Try The Grill Next Time,,,,,
,2314,Loved The Pizza Room Service - Perfect For Our Family,,,,,
,2315,Thought The Menu Could Have Been Updated During The Week.  Food Was Good But Not Always What Was Described On The Menu - Eg Pea Shoot Salad Was Rocket Salad And One Salad Arrive Without A Major Ingredient Described (Think It Was Beetroot). Thought The Bistro Was Disappointing And Let Down The Standard Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,2318,It Is A Spectacular Venue. The Staff Are Absolutely Fantastic,,,,,
,2320,Excellant  But We Were Stuffed Into A Very Small Dining Room For Breakfast And Dinner As You Had A Corporate Event On. The Staff Were Amazing Offering To Let Us Dine Anywhere We Wanted.,,,,,
,2321,We Found The Staff At The Castle Bistro Extremely Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,2326,A Little Dissapointed With The Choice Of Menu On The Sunday Lunch Time In The Brassery,,,,,
,2330,The Staff On The Gala Night Did Amazing Well Serving The Number Of People Present All In One Go Without Any Hitches.  Great Job!!!,,,,,
,2332,The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent In All Regards  Whilst The Castle Bistro Was Fair (A Bit Sterile For My Tastes).,,,,,
,2333,Bistro Just Didn't Work For Us.  I Would Re-Think It - Perhaps As A Gourmet Burger Joint Or Something.  Grill Was Great.  The Chips In The Bistro Were Terrible - The Ones In The Grill Amazing - How Is That Possible?,,,,,
,2334,All Comments Regarding Dining Relate To The Castle Bistro - The Edwardian Grill Would Have Scored Good Throughout All The Questions,,,,,
,2336,I Was Very Disappointed To Find That The Advertised 'Bed And Breakfast' Rate Did Not Allow For A Cooked Breakfast. On One Morning  My Wife And I Chose The Cooked Breakfast  And Not Only Were We Both Served The Wrong Items  But We Felt Very Much 'Fleeced' Having To Pay Extra For The Cooked Options Which Were By No Means Special. On The Second Morning  My Wife Informed A Member Of Staff  As We Left  That There Were Flies On The Cut Fruit  But She Was Told 'I Know  But There's Nothing We Can Do'. On The Contrary  A Net Lid Or Cover Could Have Been Used  But We Chose Not To Argue.,,,,,
,2338,Bistro Breakfast Buffet Was Terrible And Inedible Waiter Did Not Even Question Why We Did Not Touch Our Food.,,,,,
,2340,The Lunch That We Had In The Bistro (The Olive Bread Was Yummy) Was In Fact Nicer Than The Edwardian,,,,,
,2342,Food And Service Both Truly Outstanding A Credit To The Team,,,,,
,2344,The Menu Choice In The Bistro Could Have A Few More Salads On The Menu Please. The Service In The Grill Needed To Be Sped Up.,,,,,
,2346,Such A Shame. We Stayed 2 Years Ago In The Hotel And Felt The Same About The Bistro Then.  There Seemed An Atmosphere Between The Chef And The Waiting Staff Which Was Clearly Evident To Us Eating In A Quiet Bistro.  Simple Service Issues Were Not Met. Plates Not Cleared On A Timely Basis  Unattentive Staff. A Number Of Staff But Not Doing The Right Things. (Except Chris Who Seemed Much More Switched On). We Ate There On Our First Night But Didnt Want To Dine There Again.  Disappointing.,,,,,
,2348,This Was A Huge Let Down. On Arrival With Friends Our First Experience Was Lunch On The Terrace Surrounded By Debris. All Tables Were Littered With Crockery And Leftovers.   Service Was Very Slow  And Prevented Us From Enjoying Desserts  Coffees Etc Because We Were So Fed Up Of Waiting.  The Maitre D' On Our Second Night Informed Me That Service Was Slow Because We'd Sat At The Wrong Table ( The Table Was Set And No One Greeted Us On Arrival). This Bordered On The Rude  Although She Seemed Very Stressed And There Seemed Very Few Waiting Staff.  Our Dining Experience Was More 2 Star Than 5.,,,,,
,2350,Sadly My Husband Was Very Disappointed In The Wood Pigeon He Had As A Starter At Dinner - It Was Very Tough And He Was Unable To Eat It. The Waitress Apologised And Offered A Replacement Starter Which He Decided Not To Have And The Cost Was Deducted.,,,,,
,2351,My Food Was Very Excellent  However My Husbands Rump Steak Was Not Good.  It Was Very Tough And He Had A Job To Cut It  So The Meal Was Not Eaten.  That Said  The Staff Were Very Good With No Issues About The Cost Of The Steak Being Taken Off The Bill.  The Starters & Dessert Excellent. Breakfast Was Very Pleasant,,,,,
,2353,Sunday Breakfast Slightly Disorganised.   A Lot Of Staff But Not Desperately Efficient.  Also Haddock Overlooked.   Toast Soggy And Served On A Plate.   Not The Breakfast Standard Would Expect Of Such A Lovely Hotel.,,,,,
,2360,Service Not Very Professional  Staff Friendly But Slow  Service Charge For This Kind Of Service Enormous! My Husband Asked One Evening For A Second Whiskey Which Never Came And The Required Nuts Came After 15 Min!!!,,,,,
,2361,The Food Was  Exceptional And The Service Excellent.,,,,,
,2364,Superb Service In Both Venues.  Edwardian Grill Dinner Was Slightly Over-Priced For Quality But Overall Experience Was Great.,,,,,
,2365,Our First Night Experience Did Not Start Well. We Had A Waiter  German I Think  Who Was  To Put It Bluntly  Miserable. When My Husband Asked Him If He Was Finishing Soon We Got A Lot Of Moans About His Work. He Ordered The Wrong Starter For My Husband Which Was Picked Up By Another Waiter  I Believe He Was Training A Younger Woman  He Then Took Over Our Service And We Had A Wonderful Meal. He Was Very Attentive And From What I Saw Was Very Good With The Young Woman He Was Advising.,,,,,
,2366,We Only Dined In The Edwardian Grill On Out 1St Night As We Felt The Menu Choice Was A Little Limited And Were Very Surprised That It Did Not Change During The Duration Of Our Stay.  We Recently Stayed In The Star Castle Hotel On The Isles Of Scilly And For The Duration Of Our 4 Day Stay  The Menu Changed Every Night. We Dined For The Remaining 3 Nights In The Bistro  As This Suited Us More.,,,,,
,2367,As Noted The Brasserie Was Poor  The Above Is For The Grill Only,,,,,
,2368,The Staff Were Helpful But Had Very Limited Knowledge  They Did Not Even Know What A Drink 'On The Rocks' Was,,,,,
,2369,Our Dining Experience Was Mixed. Our First Night We Used The Castle Bistro And Found The Food Was Poor Quality. We Did Go In At 9Pm On Friday Evening So Perhaps The Time Was Late  Though We All Had Steak  And The Chips Had Been Re-Heated And Served To Us. They Were Not Fresh  And We Expected More From Our Meal And The Bistro. In Addition  The Waiting Staff Here Are Of A Lesser Quality Than The Rest Of The Hotel - Leaning Over You To Get The Next Persons Plate And Not Relaxed Dining But Careless Service. The Edwardian Grill Was Exceptional On The Saturday Evening - The Beef Was Superb And We Enjoyed Our Experience. Breakfast In The Edwardian Grill Was More Challenging As There Did Not Feel That There Was Sufficient Staff At Breakfast Who Actually Served  And The Buffet Looked Used And Not Fresh. We Were In Breakfast By 9Am  So Did Not Think We Were Late. The Cooked Breakfast Was Well Cooked And The Ingredients Were Top Quality.,,,,,
,2370,Service In The Bistro Is Still Poor. Initially (6.30) The Bistro Was Empty And We Were Made To Feel That It Was Very Difficult To Squeeze Us In Because A Group Of People Had Booked For 7.30. There Were Only 4 Other Diners Yet I Had To Approach The Bar For A Second Drink ( The Chef Was The First To See Me Standing There And Got The Drinks For Me)  And The Language Barrier Caused Quite A Lot Of Confusion With Our Order. Again I Had To Leave My Seat To Correct The Mistake. The Starter Was Good  But The Main Course (Lasagne) Was Very Dry And Overcooked. However  Breakfast Was Excellent In Every Respect.,,,,,
,2372,Wonderful Service - Special Thanks To Front Of House For Our Complimentary Champagne  Card Etc For My Wife's 'Significant' Birthday,,,,,
,2373,Shame That The Dress Code Of No Jeans Was Not Enforced And Whilst We Had Suitably Dressed Up There Were People Who Looked Like They Were Eating In Mcdonald's !!!  No Point Having A Dress Code If You Are Not Brave Enough To Enforce It.,,,,,
,2374,Expensive,,,,,
,2376,Service Outstanding But Let Down By The Food.,,,,,
,2377,As Advised I Found It To Be Informal And Relaxing Especially Whilst Dining With A 3 Yr Old And 6 Yr Old!,,,,,
,2378,Restaurant Was Very Quite  So No Atmosphere. Found Bones In My Rabbit Terrine  Head Waiter Apologised And Removed This From My Bill.,,,,,
,2383,We Asked For A Taster Menu And It Was Excellent.,,,,,
,2396,I Don't Think We Would Eat In The Bistro - In Our View It Doesn't 'Fit In' With The Rest Of Bovey Castle,,,,,
,2404,We Were Rather Disappointed That As We Were Staying With You That We Could Not Eat In A Lounge Because All The Tables Were Booked Out For Cream Teas!! We Had To Move From A Quiet  Comfortable Settee In A Lounge To Have A Sandwich And Drink In The Oak Bar  I Was Not Happy About This. !!,,,,,
,2408,Food As Always Was Excellent,,,,,
,2409,A Little More Variety Would Be Good.  'Specia'l Starter And Main Course Were The Same On Both Evenings Which Was A Little Disappointing,,,,,
,2410,Very Slow (Over An Hour For Food To Arrive In Bistro) And When It Did It Was Not Hot And Wasn't Very Good. The Waitress Told Us Others Had Also Complained,,,,,
,2412,Also Dined In The Castle Bistro -  Feedback Only For Ref /Info. - Not Referred To Personnel At The Time  -  Spaghetti Vongola Was Served Without Bowl For Shells And No Fork. A Main Dish Serving Was Originally Served In Error For A Starter Size Order -(As Main Following Starter). In Correcting This The Smaller Portion Was Served In A Cold Bowl Which Was Unsuitable Particularly Due To Large Surface Area Of Spaghetti Meaning Fast Cooling. Service Was Otherwise Pleasant And Efficient.,,,,,
,2414,Food Was Good But Overpriced  Had Our Meal Not Been Included In The Deal We Would Probably Not Have Eaten There.,,,,,
,2415,Main Course Food Delivered And Then Had To Wait For Veg. Not Good !!,,,,,
,2417,With Regards The Evening Meal In The Bistro We Had To Continually Ask For Things That Should Just Have Been Readily Available I.E.  Salt And Pepper And Then For Butter To Go With The Smoked Salmon And Brown Bread. Â€¢	The Salad In Both The Starter And Main Was Gritty Â€¢	Breakfast On The First Morning 10Th Sept Was Chaotic Despite  Only  About Four Tables Being Occupied At The Time  We Had To Ask For Toast Which Arrived When We Had Finished Our Breakfast  We Had To Ask For Butter At Then A Second Lot Of Toast Arrived.  ,,,,,
,2418,The Staff Used Thier Discretion And Allowed Us To Eat In The Library And Reserveda Table In Front Of The Firs Just For Us -Wonderful!,,,,,
,2419,Breakfast Excellent In Parts  Great Freindly  Service But The Food Is Over Elaborate For What Can Be Delivered. You Make Tea With Boiling Water. Frankly With Such Wonderful Ambiance  Enthusiastic And Friendly Staff It Was A Disappointment  I Have Had Better In A Little Chef.  Management Need To Take Breakfast.,,,,,
,2422,There Were 15 Of Us - A Black Tie Dinner -.  The Service And Location Was Excellent.,,,,,
,2426,Food In The Edwardian Grill Was Wonderful And So Was The Service And Ambience.  However  I Feel Â£29.00 For 2 X Kir Royals Was A Bit Much.  We Had A Few Issues In The Bistro On One Of The Nights Ie. Mediocre Starter  Wine Not Being Opened Or Poured  Staff Not Asking If Our Starter And Main Course Were Ok  Asking For French Mustard Which Arrived At The End Of The Meal.  However  After Speaking With The Restaurant Manager She Agreed Not To Charge Us For Our Meal Only For The Wine.  We Were Pleased With This Outcome.,,,,,
,2427,The Service In The Bar Before Dinner Was Very Disorganised - We Waited Some 10 Minutes For Someone To Take Our Order And Then 15 Minutes For A Drink To Arrive. As Soon As It Did  We Were Told Our Table Was Ready In The Restaurant!,,,,,
,2430,The Bistro Provides A Good Casual Alternative To The Edwardian Restaurant,,,,,
,2431,If Not On An Inclusive Offer Food Wine And Beverages Are Very Expensive,,,,,
,2432,I Ate Very Little Of My Starter As The Prosciutto Was Thick And Chewy. The Waitress Gave Us Coffee / Chocs Later As A Token Compensation. My Husband's Choice Was Fine.We Both Had Steak  Mine Was Medium/Rare And Most Of It Stayed On The Plate As It Was Awful. The Quality Of The Meat Didn't Merit Short Cooking. We Chose Not To Say Anything ( Though The State Of The Meat Said It All )As I Didn't Want To Spoil The Evening. My Husband's Steak Was Well Done And He Ate It. We Had Been Really Looking Forward To Our Meal So You Can Imagine The Disappointment.,,,,,
,2434,The Bistro Was Pleasant And The Staff Very Accommodating. The Menu Was Rather Limited  Especially Since We Ate Both Lunch And Evening Meals There  And Some Of The Meals Were A Little Disappointing. The Pheasant  In Particular Was Tasteless And The Mushroom Ragout Was Dripping In Oil With Overcooked Mushrooms And Soggy Croutons.,,,,,
,2435,Just To Compliment The Restaurant And The Chef  We Had The Apple Crumble Souffle And It Was Worth Waiting The 20-30 Minutes  It Was Wonderful,,,,,
,2437,Our Friends Had Wanted To Dine In The Bistro Based On A Menu They Had Seen But On The 'Day' The Menu Bore No Relation To That Menu - But We All Agreed That On Our Next Visit We Would Dine In The Bistro.,,,,,
,2438,Breakfast Was Very Good. Disappointed With Dinner. Starters V Good But Mains Were Poor. I Had The Smoked Siloin Beef & It Was Very Tough. My Wife Had Fish & Very Salty. ( We Should Have Said Somethig At The Time ),,,,,
,2441,The Only Point We Would Make Is We Are Surprised You Charge Extra For Full English Breakfast  And The Fresh Fruit Was Disappointing  Unripe And Tasteless.,,,,,
,2444,The Maitre D Lady Is Excellent. Professional  Competant And In Command. Do Not Lose Her.,,,,,
,2449,Edwardian D/R Service Excellent And Some Dishes Really Outstanding; Beef Carpaccio Was Unforgettable And We Rated Our Dinner There.Cooked Breakfast Not Good At All - Bacon Tough As Old Boots  Sausage A Horrible Colour And Hard  Mushroom Dry  Egg Overcooked (I've Had Fresher And Better Cooked Breakfasts In B&Bs). Bistro Cheerful And Ok; Not Much Atmosphere And Feels Like A Canteen  But The Food Was Acceptable.,,,,,
,2450,Having Friends And Grandson With Us The Use Of The Libary Was Very Special. We Had Lunch In The Bistro.Service Was First Class But The Food Was A Little Dissapointing,,,,,
,2451,The Edwardian Grill ... Atmosphere Ruined By Two Tables With Young Children Who Were Very Loud And Running Around. It Was Like Dining In A Kindergarden. Breakfast .. Waited 15 Minutes For A Fried Egg ... Burnt Underneath  Uncooked On Top. Returned Via Waiter.  Castle Bistro .. Waited 20 Minutes For A Portion Of Mango Cheesecake Despite Two Requests .. Finally Cancelled The Order And Left!,,,,,
,2452,The Menu Should Have A Special On Each Day.  Currently To Find The Same Menu When Spending More Than One Night Was Boring. One Of The Dishes On The First Night A Risotto With Crab Meat Etc Was Too Salty.  However The Slow Roast Loin Of Beef Was Very Good. Sad You Do Not Serve Kippers For Breakfast.,,,,,
,2453,Limited Menu. No Poultry Pork Or Especially Lamb.,,,,,
,2454,Enjoyed The Breakfast Buffet Table. Did Not Care For The Other Breakfast Menu Selections. Dinner Menu Was Satisfactory.,,,,,
,2455,I Booked Your 'Summer Madness' Package And I Was A Little Disappointed That Tha Meal Allowance In The Edwardian Grill Was Not Really Enough. I Was Also Unhappy That Drinks Could Not Be Included In The Overall Food Allowance And Were Charged For Separately. Finally I Felt Uncomfortable With The Service Charges Being Automatically Added To My Account. This Practice Is Also Very Common On Cruise Ships And I Believe That The Customer Should Be Free To Decide When And Where To Tip For Good Service Rather Than Feel Obligated In This Way.,,,,,
,2462,Thoroughly Enjoyed Both Meals And Found Staff Attentive.,,,,,
,2465,Limited Menu. No Poultry Pork Or Especially Lamb.,,,,,
,2466,Dining Room Fine But Bar Service Very Poor. 20 Mins To Get First Drink At 6.30 With One Other Customer In Bar.Call 01822 854576 For More Details.,,,,,
,2468,We Had Friends Who Live In Devon Join Us For The Day And Dinner On Thursday  Who Felt The Meal Was Too Expensive For Devon.  They Wouldn't Feel They Could Encourage Friends To Go To Bovey Castle For Dinner.  They Are However  Joining Us Again Next Year So  Clearly  They Will Be Saving Up!,,,,,
,2471,The Staff Were Very Good But Unfortunately The Kitchen Let Them Down.,,,,,
,2472,A Little Minimalist On Main Course Veg..,,,,,
,2475,Fantastic Food For A Catered Event  Everything We Ate Was Wonderful.,,,,,
,2476,Federico Aresti Was Amazing  Took Time To Talk To Us And Ensure We Where Served Afternoon Tea When There Was No Space To Dine. The Gin And Cider Making / Tasting Class Was Great Fun And The Guy Who Hosted Was Brilliant. Really Enjoyed It.  The Breakfast However Was Not Good  We Didnt Get Offered Hot Drinks Or Toast We Had To Ask Once We Had Finished Out Breakfast.  Dinner Was Lovely And Cocktails Out Of This World.  ,,,,,
,2480,The Menu Was Unimaginative And The Staff Rude,,,,,
,2483,Loved The Cheese Board,,,,,
,2484,Took Over 30 Mins To Get Someone To Bring Menus  Then Over 30 Mins To Bring Wine. I Had To Keep Trying To Get Staff Members Attention  I Had To Ask If I Could Have Bread. Ran Out Of Water And Had To Keep Asking For More And It Never Being Brought To The Table. The Courses Took For Ever To Be Brought Out. I Was There For Hours And Was Actually Tired And Bored By The Time I Had My Starters. It Was Actually An Anniversary For Us And It Was A Very Unenjoyable Experience. The Food However Was Fantastic. I Just Feel If Your Going To Charge High End Prices The Service Should Be High End.,,,,,
,2485,Lack Of Staff In Oak Bar Meant We Often Waited 20Mins To Order A Coffee (Or Went Without).  Edwardian Grill Was Good Food And Reasonable Service For Dinner.  Waited Over An Hour For Breakfast And Over 45Mins For Lunch In The Grill And Bistro Respectively - Overall Poor Staff Attitude And Badly Organised.,,,,,
,2487,The Wedding Package I Assume Included Drinks And Canapes But For Only 2 Canapes To Be Offered Both Of Which Were Vegetarian Was Rather Dissapointing. The Fault Here Is Really That A Package Should Exist With Such Limitation Not That The Wedding Party Chose To Select It. I Would Also Point Out That Children Should Be Either Be Served 1St At Dinner Or As An Absolute Minimum Should Be Served With The Adults On Each Table Before The Next Table Is Served. To Leave Children On A Table Surrounded By Adults Eating Is Ridiculous. The Adults Have Little Chance Of Enjoying Their Meal In This Scenario. _ I Sound Very Negetive But That Was Not My Overall Experience As The Rest Of The Service Was Very Efficient And Of High Quality.,,,,,
,2489,We Also Used Room Service And The Quality Of The Food And Service Was Excellent.,,,,,
,2490,Food Didn't Live Up To The Prices. Steaks Were Overcooked Two Days In A Row. The Service Was A Little Slow And Lacked Attention To Detail. The Staff Seemed Like They Lacked Training In Basic Things.,,,,,
,2497,The Choice Of Beverage Was Astonishing.,,,,,
,2500,Clearly Marked Vegetarian Options Would Be Better  And More Use Of Protein In Vegetarian Food.,,,,,
,2501,Steaks Not Cooked Properly,,,,,
,2503,The Plates Were Dirty  As Was The Table. The Flowers On Ours And The Surrounding Tables Were Dead. The Food Took A While To Come Out  But The Manager Deducted Service For Taking So Long...,,,,,
,2504,Castle Bistro Does Not Have The Excellent Feel Of The Rest Of The Hotel.  This Could Be Improved By Removing Some Of The Refrigeration Units With Flourescent Lights Which Do Not Feel In Keeping With The Ambience Of The Hotel.  Also  The Bistro Was Cold And The Music Was Frequently Too Loud. In The Edwardian Grill  Whilst The Service Was Excellent  There Were A Few Service Mistakes (Clearing And Serving From Teh Same Side  For Example) Which Did Not Feel In-Keeping With The Standards Of Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,2505,Dinner Service Was Of A High Standard In Both The Bistro And Edwardian Grill. No Staff In The Oak Bar At Various Times Making It Hard To Order Drinks. Breakfast Service Was Poor  Orders Were Missed Staff Seemed To Have Very Little Training & Almost Looked Confused As To What Needed To Be Done!,,,,,
,2506,The Service In The Edwardian Grill Could Have Been Better. We Had To Get The Waiters Attention On 4 Occasions.,,,,,
,2507,Appears New Staff In Castle Bistro Who Were In Need Of Direction,,,,,
,2508,We Were Affected By Power Cuts During Our Dinner At The Edwardian Grill But As Was Candelit Did Not Impact Us Too Greatly And The Location And Dining Experience Was Lovely.  We Ordered Room Service On Our First Evening And Due To The Problems With Our Film And Tv Service In The Room  Had To Send It Away Whilst This Was Resolved. Unfortunately  Despite Their Reassurances That We Would Be Provided With Fresh Food Later In The Evening  When It Did Arrive It Had Clearly Been Reheated And The Bread And Cheese Was Inedible.   Breakfast Was Very Nice With Good Choice. Afternoon Tea Was Also A Very Enjoyable Experience With Delicious Food Although We Would Have Liked The Tea To Arrive Piping Hot (It Was A Little Tepid And We Suspect The Water Had Come From A Water Heater Rather Than Been Boiled). There Was Also A Mix Up With Our Reservation And It Took A Little While To Sort Out A Table For Us. We Were Also Using A Gift Voucher For Our Afternoon Tea But Despite Presenting Our Voucher At The Time  It Still Appeared On Our Final Bill When We Checked Out.   ,,,,,
,2510,The Waiter Got The Steaks Muddled Up And Brought Out The Wrong Dessert. When The Dessert Was Replaced The Waiter's Attitude Was Very 'Precious'. We Could Not Dine In The Restaurant In The Edwardian Grill Due To A Function  However The Side Room Setting Was Pretty Dingy And Grim  There Was Big Black Grubby Spillage Stains All Over The Carpet. I Positioned By Bag Under Table  However When I Left I Forgot It Was There. The Next Morning I Rang Reception To Say I Had Left It There. To My Distress My Handbag And Contents Was Nowhere To Be Found. Reception Did Not Respond With Info So I Asked Another Member Of Staff Who Did Not Bother To Let Me Know If Had Found  This Went On All Morning. The Room Had Been Totally Emptied. I Have Still Heard No News If Bag Has Been Handed In. I'm So Upset About This  Furthermore  It's Awful A Five Star Establishment Has A Thief Amongst The Staff.,,,,,
,2514,At Each Meal There Were A Number Of Different Staff Attending To The Table.  Service Was Slow The First Time We Ate In The Bistro (On The Balcony) And I Had To Go Into The Restaurant To Ask For Condiments.  The Second Time We Ate In The Bistro No One Took Drinks Orders So I Had To Go To The Bar. The Food Was Tasty And Good Value However.  Drinks In The Oak Bar Were Lovely.  The Food Was Good But Again A Number Of Staff Attended To The Table And Were A Little Over Zealous On Filling My Glass When I Had Stated A Number Of Times I Didn't Wish For Any More Sparkling Water! I However Appreciate Attentive Service Than No Service So It Wasn't A Big Issue!,,,,,
,2515,The Food Was Superb In The Bistro; Really Good Value For Money.  We Were Slightly Disappointed With One Waiter (Whom We Ironically Had For Both Nights) - He Was Not Very Communicative And Didn't Have The Same High Standard Of Service As The Others  Who Were Superb.  His Waistcoat Was Ripped At The Back And He Tended To Slam The Food Down Onto The Table - Not The Nicest Way To Be Served.  Neither Night Were We Offered The Wine Menu By Him Either.,,,,,
,2519,The Only Reason I Have Selected Good Instead Of Excellent Is Because The Food In The Bistro Was Not Nearly As Good As The Food At The Edwardian Grill. Whilst There Is A Big Price Difference  The Food At The Bistro Was A Bit Disappointing And The Service Was Very Slow. The Staff Did Not Seem Particularly Interested Or Attentive. The Staff At The Edwardian Grill Were Very Good And The Food Was Excellent.,,,,,
,2521,I Was Underwhelmed By The Food. I Had Mould On My Bread In The Morning  And A Hair In My Mash For My Sunday Lunch. The Food In The Castle Bistro Was Not Terrible But Pretty Tasteless And The 3 Dessert Options Was Reduced To One By The Time We Ordered - Not Very Impressed We Were Not Offered An Alternative,,,,,
,2524,Fantastic Food.  One Comment Only Regarding Our Casual Dinner In The Bistro  I Think You May Have Had A New Member Of Staff As He Was Attentive  But Didn't Understand Many Of Our Requests And His Facial Expressions Told Either Of His Annoyance At Some Requests (For More Bread And Then The Bill / Bottle Wine For The Meeting Room That Evening)...  The Other Staff Were Aware Of Him However And Did Help Him To Understand / Know How To Deal With These Requests More Quickly And Efficiently.  The Chef Was Fantastic And It Was Great To Meet Him And Again  The Staff Couldn't Have Been More Helpful.  It's A Joy!,,,,,
,2526,The Staff Seemed Unable To Cope  The Afternoon Tea Was Expensive And I Have Had Much Better Ones.,,,,,
,2527,The Service For Afternoon Tea Was Not Efficient Or Prompt.  The Quality Of The Food Was Average For The Standard Of The Venue And The Price Of The Food.,,,,,
,2528,The Food In The Cafe Bistro Was Far Nicer Than The Edwardian Grill.  The Breakfast Service In The Edwardian Grill Was Particularly Poor.,,,,,
,2529,The Heating Was On Full Tilt And The Room Temperature Must Have Been North Of 30 Degrees - Not Pleasant! At Breakfast Staff Were Rushing Around Far Too Quickly Giving A Slightly Chaotic And Unnerving Atmosphere. 5 Star Service Should Be Serene And Confortable. So Not Really 5 Star Or Consistent With The Pricing.,,,,,
,2530,Food Was Nice  Service Slow In Castle Bistro For Lunch And Almost Comical In Edwardian Grill At Dinner.  Had To Ask 5 Times And 3 Separate Staff For A 'Surprise' Birthday Cake For Our Friend That Was Pre Ordered  Had To Ask About 3 Times For Bread  Tried To Change The Time Of Our Table Before Dinner And Ended Up With Two Table Bookings At Different Times  Took The Waiter Three Attempts To Understand What Our Friend Was Requesting For Main Course.,,,,,
,2531,The Food/Menu Was Boring And The Beef Was Very Tough And Took Forever To Chew  The Seabass Should Have Come With Some Veg To Take Away From The Richness Of The Crab Risotto. If You Are Charging A Lot Of Money Food Then You Need To Deliver The Goods And Up Your Game. The Amount Of Cheese Given For Â£14 Was Very Small. I Have Eaten Better In Gastro Pubs. I'm Afraid To Say A Lot Of The Male Waiters Had Bad Bo Which Is Not A Pleasant Experience When Dining.,,,,,
,2532,Disappointed Not To Be Allowed To Have Burger Cooked Pink As I Would Have Liked It. Waiter To His Credit Stuck To His Guns And Claimed Company Policy. Bizarre.,,,,,
,2534,I Am Lactose Intolerant And The Staff Were Very Helpful In Catering To My Needs.,,,,,
,2535,The Young Lady Who Served Us Wine Was Fantastic. She Was Very Enthusiastic  Energitic And Intelligent. Her Knowledge Of The Wine Was Impressive.  It Was Also Great Being Served By Federico And Other Managers.,,,,,
,2536,We Were Not Told About The Castle Bistro And Really Only Discovered It By Mistake!  We Asked About Booking A Table For Dinner But The Person In The Bar Didn't Explain Our Options...So Booked For The Edwardian Grill.   However When We Came Downstairs Later...Looking For It...We Were Directed To The Castle Bistro!,,,,,
,2537,The Manageress Needs A Good Talking Too As Was Argumentative To Us And Also Another Couple  Out Table Was Booked At Wrong Time By Reception And She Was Very Rude And Sarcastic,,,,,
,2538,The Food Was Exceptional.,,,,,
,2539,When We Booked The Hotel We Asked To Reserve A Table At 8Pm But The Lady Told Us Only 8:15Pm Was Available. She Didn't Tell Us This Was Due To A Wedding On Earlier In The Day  So We Thought It Must Be Because The Restaurant Was Very Busy. When We Arrived For Dinner We Were Quite Surprised That The Restaurant Was Empty And Had Very Little Atmosphere At The Beginning. However  Once More Guests Started To Arrive It Then Had More Of A Buzz And We Really Enjoyed The Meal.,,,,,
,2540,Booked A Later Dining Time For A Quieter Setting But Children And Families Present Till Late.  Felt That The Restaurant Front-Of-House Would Benefit From An Experienced Maitre D' To Visibly Lead And Direct Staff As One Would Expect In A Restaurant Serving Equivalent Standard Of Food. This Would Bring Some Attention To Detail That We Felt Was Lacking (Worn Table Cloths Etc.).  No Advice On Wines Offered By Staff.  We Would Have Liked To Had Our Order Taken In Lounge  Perhaps Had Pre-Dinner Drinks And Then Invited Through  To Make Use Of The Nice Rooms.,,,,,
,2542,Our Experience In The Oak Bar Was A Real Highlight Thanks To The Excellent Staff Who Set Up A Private Table For Us By The Fire In The Library.,,,,,
,2543,The Lights In The Edwardian Grill Are Too Strong! For The Most Part  Couples Were Seated At Tables And It Would Have Been Better To Dim The Lights More So That There Was A More Intimate Feel.,,,,,
,2544,It Was All Really Lovely,,,,,
,2547,Still Think The Bistro Menu Needs Some Though.  Perhaps A Few More Sandwiches?,,,,,
,2549,Quality And Presentation Of Food Was Not As High As Expected - Many Other Venues In The South West Provide Far Higher Quality.,,,,,
,2551,Our First Breakfast In The Grill Was Disappointing - Everything Was Overcooked As If Heated Up From Earlier. Other Occasions All Was Fine,,,,,
,2552,Dinner Was Served In Our Room But There Was No Tray So We Had To Call To Get The Plates Etc.  Removed.  We Had Breakfast In Our Room.  This Was A Complete Shambles  We Had To Call Down 4 Times To Get The Right Order.  We Put A Full Report On The Tray Which Someone May Have Seen But In Summary:  No Salt And Pepper  Pepper Eventually Provided But No Salt  Soup Spoons For Cereal  No Sugar For Cereal  No Cups And Saucers  No Butter And Marmalade  Cooked Courses Wrong  Inadequate Milk.  I Could Go On.,,,,,
,2556,The Edwardian Is Extremely Expensive,,,,,
,2557,Open And Comfortable,,,,,
,2558,We Had A Good Dining Experience In The Edwardian Grill However We Did Not Think That The Bistro Was A True Five Star Dining Experience.  The Menu Is Rather Old Fashioned - There Is Much More Creative Bistro Menus Around - The Furnishings And Decor Are Not Five Star Standard.  The Bistro Was Not Value For Money,,,,,
,2559,The Quality Of The Food Was Not Up To The Standard Of The Rest Of The Hotel.  One Fellow Guest Who Was On Her 4Th Visit Says She Come Back For Other Things But Cannot Recommend The Food To Her Friends.,,,,,
,2561,2 Overall Was Because Of A Slight Inattention Of Serving Staff.,,,,,
,2562,Outstanding,,,,,
,2564,Unmemorable,,,,,
,2566,On One Evening During Our Stay The Service Was Very Slow & There Were A Lot Of Complaints About Cold Food.,,,,,
,2568,The Staff Need To Learn To Look At The Guests Because It Was Almost Always Impossible To Attract Their Attention. When They Did Come They Were Very Helpful,,,,,
,2569,Yes The First Night All 4 Steaks Were Not Very Good. The Second Night The Food Was Very Very Good We Were Told It Was A Different Chef Because We Had Two  Extra People In Our Party We Would Have Not  Eaten In The  Grill We Glad We Did,,,,,
,2571,I Am Vegetarian. The Starter Was Excellent. The Main Course Of Provencal Vegetables Was Really Sub-Standard. The Combination Of Tastes Just Did Not Work At All. The Choice Was Not Great Either.,,,,,
,2572,The Bistro Lacks Atmosphere And Has A Limited Menu So We Switched To The Edwardian.,,,,,
,2573,Perhaps Rather Expensive In Comparison With Similar Establshments,,,,,
,2575,When Trying To Book For Dinner I Was Offered 6:30 Or 9:00. Spoke To Duty Manager & Managed To Obtain 7:00 But Really Wanted 7:30. When 7:30 Arrived Only Another 4 Guests Were In The Restaurant & At No Time Was The Restaurant More Than Half Full,,,,,
,2578,Try To Add Some More Vegetarian Dishes With Large  Portions .,,,,,
,2579,We Ate At The Bistro For Lunch And Enoyed The Experience - We Ate In The Evening And Were Disappointed To Find It Was The Same Menu - Also The French Fries Came Much Later Than The Steak And We Were Almost Finished Before We Got The Wine. The Wedding Breakfast Was Very Good And The Service Was Excellent. But We Went For A Bite Of Lunch To Discover The Same Menu Again- We Didn't Bother.,,,,,
,2581,Just Excellent,,,,,
,2583,Bistro Menu Somewhat Limited  But Food Very Tasty And Well Presented,,,,,
,2585,We Would Definitely Recommend,,,,,
,2587,Edwardian Grill Is Beautiful But The Food Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,2590,The Responses Above Are Related To The Edwardian Grill  Our Experience At The Bistro Were Fair At Best.,,,,,
,2591,The Edwardian Grill Was Closed.  The Oak Bar Was Very Nice.,,,,,
,2594,Our Lunch In The Bistro Was Very Ordinary And The Service Was Fairly Poor. I Discussed Our Experience With The Head Waitress At The Time And She Undertook To Address The Problems For Future Diners. We Dined In The Edwardian Grill  Which Was Virtually Empty. We Had The Tasting Menu  Which Was Unimpressive. At The End Of The Meal The 4 Members Of Our Party Tried To Recall Each Course And Each Could Only Remember 3 - The Fois Gras Terrine Because We All Felt That It Was Too Heavy   And The Beef And The Pudding  Which Were Both Delicious. We Felt That 2 Courses Out Of 7 Was A Fairly Poor Ratio. Again  We Often Choose A Tasting Menu When Dining Out And This Is The First Time We Have Not Been Delighted  And Often Surprised  By Each Course. We Can Still Recall With Great Pleasure All Courses On The Menu At A Number Of Establishments At Which We Have Dined This Year So Our Experience At Bovey Leaves Us Feeling Deflated And Disappointed. The Cocktail Waiter Was Excellent.,,,,,
,2597,Edwardian Grill Was Good.   The Bistro Was Disappointing - Poor Choice And My Wife Could Not Eat The Fish & Chips Because The Fatty Fish Had Been Put On Top Of The Chips And So Drained On To The Chips - Inedible!   I Do Not Eat Burgers Nor Fish & Chips So Not Much Left To Appeal,,,,,
,2602,In The Edwardian Grill My Main Course Looked As If It Had Been Sitting On The Pass For Several Minutes Before Being Served  Which Detracted From The Quality Of The Dish When I Finally Received It. I Felt The Cost Of Dinner Was Not Reflected In The Quality Of The Food.,,,,,
,2603,The Bistro Was Busy And Could Have Been Difficult To Book If Arrived Late In The Afternoon.The Manager Did Put Us In Early.,,,,,
,2604,In The Edwardian Grill Food And Drink Overpriced For What It Was  The Main Course Had No Finesse On The Plate Steak Ok But Not The Best Ive Had.Breakfast Was Very Average The Bistro On The Otherhand Was Very Good.,,,,,
,2606,There Is A Lack Of Fresh Fruit And Veg I Also Would Have Liked More Salad Selection In The Bistro. The Chefs Trousers Were Dirty And Torn Heater Next To Us Did Not Get Warm. No Glasses In The Bathroom. Waiters In The Grill Did Not Remove Are Dirty Plates Before Bringing Our Next Course.,,,,,
,2609,Until We Were Able To Ask The Chef To Prepare Our Choice Of Meal 1.E. Steaks The Menu Generally Was Boring In Both Choice Snd Stale. Surely  A Daily Specisl Could Be Offered.,,,,,
,2610,The Service In The Edwardian Was Appalling And Service For Afternoon Tea In The Hotel Was A Farce - It Was Chaos And The Staff Did Not Seem To Know What They Were Doing. We Gave Up One Day After 45 Mins Of Waiting.,,,,,
,2611, The Food In The Bistro Was Good  Nor Excellet  The Edwardian Grill Much Better. Most Of All We Enjoyed The Cornish Tea Arragement On The Terrace,,,,,
,2612,Some Of The Waiters At Breakfast & In The Bistro Did Not Speak Good Enough English To Understand And Respond To Our Requests,,,,,
,2614,Edwardian Grill And The Castle Bistro Ran Out Of Food That Was On The Menu As Mentioned In My Previous Comments  The Castle Bistro Food Was Of Particular Poor Quality  However  All The Staff Were Very Good.,,,,,
,2617,This Was Our Second Stay At Bovey And On Both Occasions The Service For Dinner On The Saturday Evening Was Appalling In Terms Of The Time Taken  To Serve Drinks And Food. 35 Minutes Before Pre Dinner Drinks Arrived....40 Minutes At The Table Before Starters Arrived...Had To Ask For Bread Three Times. 3 Hours 30 Mins For A Three Course Meal. The Only Part Of The Service That Was Speedy Was The Waiter Continually Filling Our Glasses With Wine Even Before The Starters Had Arrived. The Excuse That You Were Very Busy Simply Will Not Wash Given Your Prices. You Seem To Have Plenty Of Staff Available So It Would Appear That Whoever Is Responsible For Managing Them Needs To Be Replaced! In Contrast The Service In The Bistro Which Was Much Busier And Complex Given The Number Of Children Was Excellent.,,,,,
,2618,Edwardian Grill Sunday Lunch Superb,,,,,
,2619,We Booked A Dinner  Bed And Breakfast Package And Were Told We Would Be Dining In The Castle Bistro. In A 5 Star Hotel  We Not Expecting To Be Confronted By A Bistro Which Resembled A 'Little Chef' Roadside Cafe. We Had Booked Bovey Expecting A High Class Pleasurable Experience And Whilst The Food Was Passable  Nothing Else (Apart From Breakfast) Was.,,,,,
,2620,All Staff Were Very Helpfull With Mrs Thomas Gluten Free Diet. Thank You,,,,,
,2621,Never Again,,,,,
,2622,We Found The Choice Of Food On The Castle Bistro Menu Very Limited & Not At All What We Expected. I Did Explain When Booking That This Was Our 35Th Wedding Anniversary Celebration & On Reflection Perhaps The Person Taking Our Booking Should Have Recommended The Edwardian Grill As A Dining Venue.,,,,,
,2623,We Ate In The Bistro Which Had No Atmosphere  A Poor Menu And No Wine List. We Were Told We Could Have Wine By The Glass Which Would Be A Merlot. On Insisting We Were Eventually Given A Very Uninspiring  List And The Lad Serving Us Had No Idea About Wine. My Sole Was Raw And Bloody In The Middle And Had To Be Sent Back. The Chef Told Us 'Some People Like It Underdone'!,,,,,
,2624,Breakfast Was A Shambles,,,,,
,2625,Room Smelt Of Cooking Fat/Oil,,,,,
,2632,We Had A Barbequeue That Was Well Prepared  But We Had To Do It On Our Own- Which We Did Not Know Beforehand..,,,,,
,2633,The Experience In The Bistro Was In Clear Disharmony With The Overal Service Experience At Bovie. We Waited For More Than An Hour After Ordering The Food And Apparently Nobody Felt A Need For An Excuse. The Quality Of The Food Was More Than Mediocre.,,,,,
,2637,Looking Forward To Eating In The Grill Room Next Time.,,,,,
,2638,I Have Already Mage Comments About This,,,,,
,2640,No,,,,,
,2641,Better Menu Required. Far Too Limited,,,,,
,2642,Shortage Of Basic Food  Ie Prawns Was Totally Unacceptable   A Child Was Constantly Running Around Our Table And Insisted On 'Hitting' Me. A Member Of Staff Who I Complained To Said This Is What We Get At This Time Of Year  This Left Me Speechless. Food Presented In A Pool Of Grease And Virtually Inedible.,,,,,
,2645,The Absence Of Kippered Herring On The Breakfast Menu Was Shocking.  The Service Of Instant Decaffinated Coffee Is Unacceptable In A Hotel Aiming At The Heights You Do And The Prices You Charge.,,,,,
,2647,At The Prices You Charge  I Expected A Wonderful Dining Experience.I Did Not Expect To Have To Pour Our Own Wine- Twice - Or Leave The Table To Go And Find A Waitress Because No Sugar Was Brought For Our Coffees ( And Not Enough Milk Either). I Also Had To Request A Knife At Breakfast As The Table Was Incorrectly Laid. When One Of My Companions And Myself Both Ordered Fried Eggs  She Was Brought Two Eggs On Her Plate  None Arrived For Me.,,,,,
,2649,Quite Expensive Without Our 20% Discount,,,,,
,2650,We Were Pleased With The Breakfast Service. However  We Were Very Disappointed With The Manager Of The Restaurant And His Arrogant Attitude Towards Us As Customers. We Had Booked At The Front Desk For Guests And The Restaurant Manager Refused To Seat Us Until I Went To The Front Desk And The General Manager Came To Sort Out The Booking. We Were Very Pleased With His Resolution Of The Situation.,,,,,
,2651,See Letter In The Post.,,,,,
,2652,Not Your Fault  But The Dining Room Lacked Atmosphere Because It Was Almost Empty.  Good Selection Of Wine  And We Were Very Pleased With The Choice We Made.,,,,,
,2653,Meal Was Very Good,,,,,
,2658,We Were Rather Disappointed With The Breakfast As Some Of The Ingredients In The Full English Breakfast Had Been Re-Heated Which You Do Not Expect In A Five Star Hotel.,,,,,
,2659,Your Maitre D'hotel  Ben  Is By Far Your Best Asset - Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Him  And A Superb And Friendly Manner.,,,,,
,2662,No Mention Of The Value  Something I Think Is Most Important. This Certainly Was Not Value For Money. ,,,,,
,2663,Just To Say Excellent All Round  Sunday Lunch Amazing Value !!,,,,,
,2664,I Thought Taking Food Orders By The Wait Staff And Then Having Someone Else Come Out With Our Food Was Awkward. They Often Did Not Know To Whom The Order Was To Go. I Also Thought Two Of My Dinner Mains Were Under Par: The Beef First Night And The Duck. They Need Improvement In My Opinion.,,,,,
,2671,It Was My Wife's Birthday Treat. However On Saturday Eveninig We Eat In The Edwardian Room. Generally The Evening Was Good But Spolilt Badly At The End. We Asked For Coffee And Petit Fours. The Waitress Brought The Coffee (And Put The Cups On The Saucer By Picking The Cup Up By The Rim With Bare Hands - I Though That Was What Handles Were For! We Asked Three Times For The Petit Fours And They Never Arrived. In The End After 20 Minutes The Coffe Was Stone Cold And Still No Petit Fours. So We Reluctanly Had To Leave. It Seemed That When A Lot Of Clients Arrived At The Same Time They Could Not Cope. That Evening Was The Real Dissappointment Of The Weekend. The Service In The Bistro Aws Far Better And More Friendly And Efficient,,,,,
,2673,The Service And Meal Quality In The Edwardian Was Excellent,,,,,
,2680,One Good Guy Working In The Bistro Was Not Really Enough But He Sure Tried.,,,,,
,2681,Again Excellent Service   Helpful But  Unobtrusive Staff. Wonderful Menu  Spoilt For Choice !,,,,,
,2682,This Was A Cullinary Experience Excellent,,,,,
,2685,Did Mention On Telephone With Resort Staff - And A Few Times While At The Hotel - That It Was My Son's 21St Birthday On The Friday Of Our Stay (8 Feb) And Asked For A Nice Table In The Edwardian Grill.  Unfortunately We Were Seated Outside The Kitchen And No Mention Was Made Of This Special Occasion By Any Staff Member.  Mistake Made With Bill And On Quite A Few Occasions Had To Pour Own Water.,,,,,
,2686,Bar Service Poor.20 Mins Wait For Drink With Only One Other Customer In Bar At 6.20,,,,,
,2687,The Restaurant Edwardian Needs New Chairs And The Breakfast Buffet Is Not Five Star Level.,,,,,
,2692,Good Meal   Far Too Expensive  Dinner For 2 £186 .,,,,,
,2694,We Felt That We Had To Wait Too Long After Ordering Food In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,2695,We Dined On The Thursday Night From The Moor And Coast Menu And It Was Delicious. On The Friday Night We Invited Friends Who Live Near To Join Us And  To Be Honest  We Were A Little Disappointed. Considering The Drinks And Meal Came To Over £400 It Was Ver Very Far From Anything Resembling Value For Money.,,,,,
,2698,The Quality Of The Food And Presentation Was Excellent,,,,,
,2700,Dinner Was Good  But Not Sure It Was As Good As The Price Suggested.  Even In Top Restaurants In London I Dont Usually Pay That Much.  Pigeon Was A Little Too Rare  And Rather Tough.  Ravioli Course Was Ok But Seemed Underwhelming For £20+. Staff Were Very Good  Both In The Bar And The Dining Room. Breakfast (Full English) Was Awful.  Clearly Been Cooked A Long Time Previously And Was Very Dry And Tough. Atmosphere In The Bar Was Great  But The Cocktails Were A Disappointment.  At That Price They Have To Be Good  But Both Ours Were Watery And Bland.,,,,,
,2701,Friday Night Service Excellent. Very Discrete And Attentive. Afternoon Tea Lovely Apart From The Tea Which Had Been Brewed With Cold Water. Was Changed After Querying But Was A First In My Experience Of Cream Teas And Quite Odd.,,,,,
,2702,Could Not Have Cocktails Ordered As No One Knew How To Make Them As The Only Cocktail Waiter Was Off ! Also Ordered A Pre Dinner Drink In Bar That They Were Suppose To Bring Into Dining Area That Did Not Arrive Till Asked Twice After The Wine !,,,,,
,2703,We Waited Arond In The Bistro To Be Served. It Was About 5.45. Because It Was A Long Time Until Our Evening Meal As Mentoined Earlier. We Felt The Waiter Was A Little Aggressive And 'Whatever' In Hia Approach.The Evening Meal Was Terrible. Firstly The Room Stank Of Smelly Cheese And Was Not Removed When I Commented To The Waiter. Secondly My Wife's Ravioli Was Possibly The Worst Pasta Dish Ever !! Pasta And Mashed Potato Is Almost Unheard Of. The Pasta Was Chewy And The Spring Onions Were Inedible.,,,,,
,2705,The Bistro Menu Is Quite Limited And Could Have Some Salads And Pasta Dishes As Well As Interesting Sandwiches.,,,,,
,2707,Excellent Food And Service In Bistro But We Found The Edwardian Was Not As Good As In Previous Years  Food In The Evening Was Not As Good And Very Slow Service On New Years Eve  However It Didn't Stop Us Enjoying The Evening.,,,,,
,2708,More Choice Would Be Nice,,,,,
,2710,More Choice Of Menu At Castle Bistro  Seemed Very Restricted For Dinner,,,,,
,2712,Service Was Poor And Painfully Slow With Waiters/Waitresses Admitting No Knowledge Of The Food They Were Serving,,,,,
,2713,The Overall Service Was Not As Good As Previous Visits. The Service Was Slow And Just Felt False.,,,,,
,2718,The Service On Our First Night In The Bistro Was Very Slow Until Frederico Intervened. We Had Problems In The Main Dining Room With Foreign Staff Getting Our Orders Right And On More Than One Occasion Missing Orders Altogether  Which We Put Down To Language Difficulties  And This Weakness Was A Disappointment Given The Cost Of The Weekend. However Emma Did Look After Us Extremely Well For Our Private Dining Experience On The Saturday Night And Was Also The Star Performer The Following Day In The Main Dining Room,,,,,
,2720,We Ordered A Curry Which Was Delivered To Our Lodge.  The Quality Of The Chicken And Prawns Was Good  But The Flavour/Sauce Was Poor And Bland - Certainly Not 'Madras'.  Furthermore  The Bombay Potatoes Were Not Delivered And We Had To Call For Them To Be Brought To Us After We Had Already Begun Our Meal.,,,,,
,2722,The Evening Staff In The Bistro Were Excellent  But The Staff At Breakfast Were Generally Poor. We Were Left Waiting For Almost 1/2 Hr For Our Breakfast Order To Be Taken. Had To Ask For Toast And Coffee Refills.,,,,,
,2723,Castle Bistro Staff Were Not Great On Service Or Knowledge Of Food/Drinks ! Also Know One Seemed To Be In Charge,,,,,
,2727,The Bistro Was Not Very Good - Very Slow And Food Was Not Special.  Edwardian Was Quite Good - But  Unfortunately  Due To A Wedding  It Was Unavailable To Us After The First Night - Along With The Rest Of The Public Rooms.  I Was Told That 'A Private Party Has Paid Handsomely To Use The Hotel For A Private Function' - Of Course My Response Is That So Did I - Do I Get A Refund For Lack Of Use Of My Hotel ?  This Was Extremely Aggravating - Made More So By The Pompous Attitude Of Staff In This Matter.,,,,,
,2728,Breakfast Was A Bit Haphazard On Our Last Morning - Maybe Not Enought Staff To Cope With The People Wanting Breakfast At The Same Time !!,,,,,
,2730,Pity The Castle Bistro Was Closed Due To Electrical Problems.,,,,,
,2731,Bistro Was Excellent Service And Great Food! Edwardian Grill Was Not Acceptable. Friday Night Dinner/ Sunday Lunch Was Painfully Slow Service. Also Had To Wait Almost 25 Mins For A Table To Sit Down For Breakfast On Saturday Morning. Really Not Acceptable.,,,,,
,2732,I Loved My Food Although Some Of My Family Said That Their Food Was Under-Cooked Or Cold.,,,,,
,2733,The Food And Service Was Truly Excellent A Credit To Your Team,,,,,
,2736,Extremely Good Food  Our Children Also Enjoyed The Choice Avaiable.,,,,,
,2741,Lack Of Choice For Vegetarians,,,,,
,2744,Spoke To Manager  Mussels Had No Depth Of Flavour In Sauce No Herbs Had Been Used The Bread Came With No Butter. The Mussels Were Not Plump And Did Not Taste Like They Were Locally Sourced.The Main Was Tasty Though The Curry Sauce/ Mayo Was Salty And So Were The Chips. The Ice  Cream Had Lumps Of Frozen Ice And We Sent That Back . Compared To The Fabulous Local Ingredients We Have In The South West The Food Does Not Reflect This . Why Not Think About Langage Or Salcombe Ice Cream   They Are Of A Much Higher Quality.,,,,,
,2745,The Edwardian Dining Was Too Pricey,,,,,
,2747,It Was My Birthday  And The Manager Had Arranged A Bottle Of Champagne On The Table  Also The Table Had Been Decorated Which Was A Lovely Touch.,,,,,
,2748,It Was My Birthday  The Manager Sent A Bottle Of Champagne To The Table  And The Table Had Been Decorated  Which Were Very Nice Touches.,,,,,
,2753,Breakfasts Were Exceptional. Dinner Was Nice Too And We Wouldhve Liked To Have Had An Afternoon Tea Which Looked Amazing But We Didnt Have Enough Days,,,,,
,2754,Not A Very Original Vegetarian Option  Had The Soup And Risotto.,,,,,
,2758,The Service In The Edwardian Grill Was Painfully Slow,,,,,
,2761,The Food In The Evening Was Of A Reasonable Standard  But Not Up To My Expectations Of Bovey Castle  The Service Was Just About Statisfactory.,,,,,
,2762,Sadly Our Food Was Terrible. My Fiancé Found A Large Piece Of Cling Film In His Starter And I Had To Send My Fish Back As It Was Raw. The Portions Are Very Small And Overall We Felt It Was Overpriced. The Only Saving Grace Was The Nice Waiter Who Was Apologetic About My Fish Being Raw.,,,,,
,2772,Our First Night I Had Three Starters And My Husband A Starter And A Main  Followed By A Magnificent Cheese Collection. We Had Just Had Dinner In A Michalin 2 Star Restaurant In Berlin. We Both Felt Our Bovey Experience Was Better.,,,,,
,2775,Brasserie Service Terrible Very Average Food No Black Pepper On Table Glasses Dirty  Had Tea In Lounge - Shambolic!  Wedding Breakfast Was Very Good Though!,,,,,
,2777,We Attended The Barbecue In The Dartmoor Room After The Wedding  The Method Of Serving The Food On Paper Plates Was Not Suitable For People Having To Stand Up And Cut Pork Crackling  A Table Was Required.,,,,,
,2778,Wait Staff Did Not Speak English And Were Not Service Minded.  Portions Were Very Small,,,,,
,2779,Bistro Menu Somewhat Limited,,,,,
,2783,Breakfast Was Realy Realy Good! Bovey Breakfast Came Highly Recomended,,,,,
,2784,Not What We Are Used To In Hotels Of This Quality Particularly Given Your Charges,,,,,
,2795,Great Food  Unfortunate Service...  All In Though We Had A Nice Time  Next Trip Will Likely Use The Lodges And Avoid The Restaurants Either Cooking Ourselves Or Going Offsite For Meals.,,,,,
,2796,See Previous Comments- Below Average Food In Brasserie,,,,,
,2797,As Above The Greatest Let Down Was The Time It Would Take To Get Anything. Although We Don't Expect Everything To Appear Immediately At Times It Was Exceptionally Slow And Sometimes Difficult To Get A Waiters Attention. We Also Had The Same Table For Breakfast As We Did For Dinner And The Food Which Had Been Dropped By Our Baby Was Still There The Next Morning Which Made Me Question The Cleaning.,,,,,
,2802,Despite Having Simple Orders Such As Sandwiches At Lunch The Food Took A Ridiculous Amount Of Time To Arrive.  In The Lounge  The Staff Did Not Clear The Table Of The Dishes From Previous Guests.  I Had To Stack Them On Nearby Tables To Make Room.  In The Meantime  Staff Stood Around Aimlessly Not Doing Anything   An Order Of Two Fried Eggs At Breakfast Took 30 Minutes To Arrive.,,,,,
,2803,We Ate In The Bistro On Our Second Night  There Was A Shortage Of Staff So Had To Wait For Food And Drinks Order. I Ordered The Fig Salad Which Didn't Come With The Balsamic Vinaigrette  Had To Ask And Wait For It.,,,,,
,2806,The Above Is Based On A Mixed Response To Travelling Around In 5Star Establishment At Various Locations Around Britain  But Including Devon And Cornwall. In Short Afternoon Tea Is Good But  Does Fall Short Of Being A Great Experience. Dinner In The Edwardian Was Mared Because Of Very Poor Service And Average Food (Based Upon The Catergory Its Supposed To Represent) One Evening Night Prior To A Wedding  Basically There Was No Planning For Hotel Guests  Who One Must Say Felt Very Neglected And At The Mercy Of A Well Oiled Mob...The Staff Clearly Could Not Cope......All In All Thats The Weak Point,,,,,
,2807,It Was A Delightful Experience,,,,,
,2809,Very Attentive Staff Felt The Breakfast Could Have Been Fresher And Warmer,,,,,
,2812,Bistro Menu Limited  Especially With Desserts. Fish Cakes Were Pumped But Flavourless. Good Attention To Children's Needs. Excellent Rating Really Applies To Edwardian Grill  A Fabulous Experience.,,,,,
,2813,Desserts Not As Good As Other Courses. Edwardian Grill Prices May Deter Locals,,,,,
,2815,Service Was Slow And Very Poor (Especially At Breakfast) When No 'One Person' Seemed To Be In Charge Of Specific Tables And It Was Hard To Attract Anyones Attention. Even After Ordering  The Wait Was Unacceptable.,,,,,
,2816,We Had Lunch In The Castle Bistro  And Evening Dinner Was Served In A Side Room Off The Edwardian Grill. (Main Restaurant Used For A Wedding Party). Service Was Very Slow In Both  And No Atmosphere In The Evening.,,,,,
,2817,The First Night  We Dined In The Edwardian Grill And It Appeared That Between The Dining Room And Grill  The Staffing Level Was Light And They Were Stretched  Which Did Make The Service Slightly Slow. We Were Not Put Out  But The Staff Were Concerned They May Not Have Maintained Standards,,,,,
,2820,Terrible Service From A Few Members Of The Staff.,,,,,
,2821,With Offer Thought Our Stay Was Good Value....However I Thought Food Overpriced  Also £15 For Gin And Tonic And A Soda And Lime Seemed Excessive! ,,,,,
,2825,Our Children Where Welcomed Into The Edwardian Grill And Made To Feel Comfortable (Even Given Extra Cushions So That They Could Reach The Table Easily)  And The Staff Even Arranged A Cake And Sung Happy Birthday To My Husband (It Was His 40Th!).,,,,,
,2826,Service Was Too Slow,,,,,
,2828,Poor Service,,,,,
,2830,The Food Did Not Live Up To Expectations And I Felt Fell Short For A Hotel Of Your Standard. The Cheese Souffle Was Awful And Should Not Have Been Served  But My Scallops Were Very Good. Other Dishes Were Somewhat Bland  My Venison Was Over Cooked And No One Asked How I Would Like It Cooked. Service Was Pleasant But Rather Slow. In Summary Fine Dinning Prices But Not Fine Dinning Quality.,,,,,
,2831,The Castle Bistro Was Very Busy On Our First Evening And Rather Chaotic - As A Result The Manager Kindly Reduced Our Bill But Unfortunately I Had Already Paid To Eat In The Edwardian Grill!,,,,,
,2834,The Castle Bistro Took A Very Long Time To Serve Our Food And It Was Very Average When It Arrived. The Waiter Also Unfortunately Had A Personal Hygiene Issue. The Breakfasts  Edwardian Grill And The Afternoon Tea Were However Of A Very High Standard And Demonstrated Efficient Waiting Staff. We Enjoyed These Experiences Immensely. Thank You,,,,,
,2839,Breakfast In The Bistro Was A Bit Disorganised,,,,,
,2840,Clearly There Were Problems With The Capability Of The Kitchen In Meeting Diners Demands. If The Problem Was Insufficient Kitchen Help  Then Reallocation Of Some Of The Waiting Staff Would Certainly Have Improved Things. Waiting Staff Were Available In Abundance (+ 2 Managers) And Spent Long Periods Just Hanging Around With Nothing To Do. Surely  A Simple Reallocation Of Labour Would Have Helped.,,,,,
,2841,My Husbands Breakfast Was Cold And My Leak At Dinner Was Uncooked- I Couldnot Cut It With The Knife!,,,,,
,2842,Personal Preferance Do Away With Foam !!!,,,,,
,2843,When I Made The Booking It Was Stated That The Dining Room On Saturday Evening Was Fully Booked And That The Only Time I Could Dine Was At 6.30 P.M. In The Bistro.  As I Had Just Eaten A Lunch At 1.45 P.M. I Wanted Very Little.  However  Having Arrived At An Almost Completely Empty Bistro At 6.30 P.M. It Became Apparent That The Bistro Would Not Be Filling Up.  I Left At Around 7.45 P.M.  The Bistro Remained Almost Empty.,,,,,
,2845,Lovely Environment But Thought Food Wasn't Very Special At All,,,,,
,2846,More Choice Would Be Advantageous,,,,,
,2848,Bistro Very Disappointing - Incredibly Slow (Over An Hour) And Tepid Not Very Good Food. We Were Told The Chef Had Left  And That Other People Were Complaining As Well.,,,,,
,2850,With Regards The Evening Meal In The Bistro We Had To Continually Ask For Things That Should Just Have Been Readily Available I.E.  Salt And Pepper And Then For Butter To Go With The Smoked Salmon And Brown Bread. The Salad In Both The Starter And Main Was Gritty. Breakfast On The First Morning 10Th Sept Was Chaotic Despite Only About Four Tables Being Occupied At The Time  We Had To Ask For Toast Which Arrived When We Had Finished Our Breakfast  We Had To Ask For Butter And Then A Second Lot Of Toast Arrived. ,,,,,
,2851,We Dined In The Castle Bistro Twice The First Evening Service Was Excellent  Food Average. The Second Evening (Thursday 29Th Aug) The Service Was Very Slow And The Food Was Very Poor. We Thought The Hotel Could Do With A Restaurant Between The Fine Dining And The Bistro,,,,,
,2852,I Will Try The Edwardian Grill Next Time.  The Bistro Was Fun But It Would Be More 'Bistro' If There Were Checked Table Clothes - The Room Does Need More Atmosphere And Less Of A 'Plastic' Look.   One Thing That Did Surprise Me - I Ordered An Ordinary Coffee At The End Of The Meal And There Was About 1/2 Inch In The Cup!!!    The Waitress Did Bring Me Some Hot Water To Top It Up.   I Think Whoever Is On The Coffee Machine Needs A Lesson!,,,,,
,2854,The First Night Was Pretty Disappointing. The Service Was Slow And I'm Surprised That None Of The Staff Knew What The Desserts Were Even Though There Were Only Two Choices. Service Improved Later In The Stay. We Also Requested A Bucket Of Ice But After 50 Minutes We Decided That It Wasn't Coming And Went To Dinner.,,,,,
,2855,We Knew That The Bistro Is Not The High-End Restaurant At Bovey Castle But We Had Expected A More Extensive Menue And The Food To Be Tastier. Service Was Friendly But A Little Slow. The Atmosphere Was More Like In A Diner  Not A Restaurant.,,,,,
,2858,The Bistro Was Pleasing But Only Mediocre,,,,,
,2859,On One Occasion I Was Extremely Disappointed With Service  Which Was Not What I Would Have Expected: Very  Very Slow And A Specific Table On The Terrace That I Had Reserved Was Not Reserved For Us. I Had To Physically Move Various Chairs (Which Are Quite Heavy) To An Alternative Table And None Of The Staff Tried To Help.,,,,,
,2860,Lack Of Vegetarian Options  Length Of Time Between Order And Receiving Food,,,,,
,2861,Bland  Unimaginative. Cold. Canteen Like...,,,,,
,2864,Food Was Poor Quality For The Accomodation.,,,,,
,2865,The Worse Dinner Ever In A Restaurant   Extremely Poor Service,,,,,
,2866,None,,,,,
,2867,Very Relaxing Atmosphere,,,,,
,2868,We Found The Grill To Be A Little Lacking In Atmosphere.  We Found The Food Enjoyable But Not Amazing - The Burger Was Not Worth £30.  Lastly  The Waiter Serving The Cheese  Whilst Being Very Pleasant  Didn't Have Much Knowledge About The Cheeses He Was Serving.,,,,,
,2870,Overall  The Food Was Very Good. However  I Had A Rib Eye Steak  It Was Cooked As I Asked  But Was Very Dry.,,,,,
,2871,Considering The High Standard Of The Food/Menu The Experience Would Have Been Even Better If This High Standard Had Been Maintained By Serving Canapes With Pre-Dinner Drinks In The Oak Bar Instead Of The Bread Sticks  Jar Of Olives And Nuts.,,,,,
,2873,A Lttle Expensive,,,,,
,2874,Odd Having Waiting Area In Dining Room,,,,,
,2876,It Deserves Its Reputation,,,,,
,2879,Very Disappointed With The Standard And Quality Of The Food Cooked  And Presented...A Great Shame For A Wonderful Venue.,,,,,
,2880,Dinner Was Nice But We Thought You Did Breakfast Even Better  As You Had The Additional Hot Options Off The Menu.,,,,,
,2881,Perfect Place To Celebrate & Over Indulge!,,,,,
,2882,Slightly Rushed During The Meal  I Would Have Expected A 3 Course Meal To Take 3 Hours.,,,,,
,2883,Service In The Edwardian Dining Room Was Depressingly Slow. Meat (Lamb And Beef) Were Not Tender,,,,,
,2885,The Food Was Not Hot & The Dining Room Was Cold,,,,,
,2887,Now Whether Our Experience Was Jaded By The Disapointing State Of Our Room I Don't Know But  We Felt The Food Though Nice Wasn't As Good As It Use To Be.,,,,,
,2905,This Was A Cullenrey Experience Beautifully Cooked And Presented At All Times,,,,,
,2909,The Food At The Wedding Breakfast Was Superb And Beautifully Presented. The Service Was Excellent.,,,,,
,2916,I Would Rename The Restaurant As The Word Grill Gives The Perception Of Something Of Lesser Quality.,,,,,
,2959,Well Good Work Keeping The Pvi Staff Well Fueled With Drinks,,,,,
,2974,The Maitre D Lady In The Dining Room Was Excellent. You Have A Treasure There. Don't Lose Her.,,,,,
,3016,Menu Is Ok For Two Night Stay/ Would Have Expected A Change Of Menu As Got A Bit Bland.,,,,,
,3032,The Service On The First Night In The Bistro Was Very Slow  This Matter Was Quickly Rectified When Frederico Got Involved,,,,,
,3041,Very Nice. Breakfast Was Extremely Poor- Frozen Sausages? Continental Was Very 3 Star.,,,,,
,3064,Ifound The Room Cold,,,,,
,3065,We Had High Tea In Front Of The Roaring Fire In The Cathedral Room....Perfection! Also  The Staff Were Not Only Efficient  But Also Very Friendly.,,,,,
,3077,Classical Music Would Be Nice In The Main Dining Room When The Pianist Isn't Available.  We Thought The Food In The Main Dining Room Was Better On Our Last Visit In April  But The Bistro Was Excellent.,,,,,
,3105,The Cheff Was Very Plesent In The Bistro  Very Passionate  Staff Were Friendly,,,,,
,3709,The Edwardian Was Excellent And The Bistro Easy; Just As It Should Be,,,,,
,3711,The Grill Was Excellent. However We Ate At The Bistro On Friday Night. The Staff Were Nervous And Unprofessional And Kept Asking For Our Order In Advance As They Were Busy. There Were Just 6 Tables So It Gave The Impression That They Staff Were To Able To Cope With A Small Number Of Orders. It Felt Hectic And Not Relaxed.,,,,,
,3712,The Cake For My Wife On The First Night Was An Excellent Touch. Thank You,,,,,
,3714,The Service In The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent But The Service In The Bistro Was Not. The Experience In The Edwardian Grill Was Also Excellent  But In The Bistro There Were Russian Guests. A Staff Member Brought A Tv For Them In The Bistro. They Said To The Staff That They Should Turn Down The Radio And Made So Much Noise  That It Was Really Annoying To Eat There. Another Couple Complained It About Them But It Was Not Much Better Afterwards. So The Couple Left The Bistro Before They Finished Their Dinner.,,,,,
,3716,We Were Given The Wrong Mennu Twice. The First I Can Forgive As Mistakes Happen And It Was Only That My Husband Had To Repick A Starter. However When The Same Waiter Returned And Said We Had Been Given The Wrong Wine Menu It Was A Bit Poor. My Husband Then Picked Again Only To Be Told (Impolitely) That They Didnt Have That Selection. When The Wine Waiter Came With Our Bottle He Snapped The Cork And Then Continued To Poor The Bottle Dispite Cork Filling The Top Of The Glass. To Be Honest We Just Put Up With It As We Didnt Want The Hassle Of Another Complaint. The Evening Was Saved By Wonderful Food  Wonderful Wine (Third Time Lucky & Dispite The Floating Bits Of Cork) And Wonderful Music From The Pianist.,,,,,
,3728,We Booked Into The Edwardian Grill But Then Changed Our Minds And Went For The Bistro Instead As We Decided We Wanted To Relax Somewhere A Bit More Informal. The Bistro Was Excellent For Weekend Brunch But Our Dinner Ended Up Being Fairly Average. I Have To Admit Two Out Of The Three Nights We Were Staying  We Braved The Dark And The Muddy Path And Went To The Pub For Dinner Which Was Excellent.,,,,,
,3730,The Staffing Didn't Appear That Experienced And The Food Is Basically A Gastro Pub Quality. I Would Suggest Doing Away With Table Service As You Expect A Whole Lot More Than Is Delivered. The Bistro Atmosphere Was Very Welcoming  The Restaurant Comfortable  Well Laid Out And Child Friendly  It Just Didn't Quite Work.,,,,,
,3732,We Waited Too Long For The Food To Arrive On A Very Quiet Saturday Lunch Time.,,,,,
,3733,The Service Was Not What We Expected. We Constantly Had To Ask For Things (More Drinks  Condiments Etc) Rather Than Staff Ntoicing Or Asking If We Wanted Them.,,,,,
,3735,I Was Just Woundering If Heaters Are Placed Outside During The Winter So That The Terrace Can Be Used When The Sun Isnt Out?,,,,,
,3738,Breakfast Waiting Time Was Awful. Twice We Had To Wait 30 Minutes For A Table,,,,,
,3740,Overall Experience Good. One Problem Being Too Much Oil In The Pasta That My Girlfriend Had On Our First Evening.,,,,,
,3741,A Very Disappointing Meal.,,,,,
,3743,The Food Was Terrible. My Fiancé Found A Large Piece Of Cling Film In His Starter And I Had To Send My Main Course Back As The Fish Was Raw. The Waiter Was Apologetic But Overall It Was A Very Disappointing Experience And We Felt The Portion Sizes Were Very Small And Overall The Dishes Were Very Overpriced.,,,,,
,3745,Loved It And Everyone Went Out Of Their Way To Make My Engagement Very Special Indeed,,,,,
,3752,Piano Music Was A Really Nice We Could Hear It Just Right When In The Bar Area But When We Moved Into The Dining Room It Was Quite Quiet Which Was A Shame.,,,,,
,3758,The Breakfast Did Not Live Up To The High Standard Set By The Meal At The Wedding,,,,,
,3764,The Afternoon Tea Was As Good As Ever In The Lounges.  However  On The Downside  We Decided On The Evening Of Sunday 4Th November To Try The Room Service Menu And Ordered 2 Ploughmans.  Not Only Was There A Delay In Excess Of 45 Mins Before Anything Arrived  The Dishes That Did Arrive Were Only Cheese And Biscuits And The Waitress Who Brought Up The Dishes Didn't Know What A Ploughmans Was!  She Did Offer To Go And Speak To The Chef  But Only Returned With A Different Bill.  After The Third Attempt Of Trying To Resolve The Matter The Correct Dishes Were Provided.,,,,,
,3767,Tea And Breakfast Service Was Poor.,,,,,
,3770,Very Expensive And Certainly Not Up To Par For Price,,,,,
,3775,Although Al A Carte  The Menu Was A Little Too Restrictive In Choice.,,,,,
,3778,The Bistro Is Very Very Average And Expensive For The Quality. The Fake Flowers In The Vases Also Make It Look Like Some Cheap Road Side Cafe. The Food In The Edwardian Grill Was Very Nice Though. Breakfast Buffet Was Really Quite Horrible And The Sausages Are Really Fatty And Cheap And There Was Barely Any Food When We Turned Up At 10.30 One Morning.,,,,,
,3781,Our Experiences In The Edwardian Grill Were Excellent.  I Think The Bistro Needs A Bigger Menu Though With More Choice.  Maybe Jacket Potatoes Or Sandwiches As Well?,,,,,
,3782,The Food Was Good. But I Expected More From The Service. The Staff Was Very Polite And Cordial  But The Service Was Slow And It Took A Long While For The Staff To Get To Our Table. The Breakfast Food Was Not As Good. The Bottom Of The Eggs Were Green And A Lot Of The Food Items Needed Refill When We Arrived Around 9:45Am. The Pastries Were Over Baked And Very Dark. Again The Service Was Slow Every Time We Asked For Something Else. Overall  The Dining Experience Wasn't As Good As I Expected  A Little Disappointed.,,,,,
,3783,Quality Of The Food Was Billiant  However I Would Note That I Asked If It Was Possible To Cook My Beef Through  And It Was Returned Heated But Similarly Uncooked. Appreciate People Feel It Can Be Better To Eat That Way  And Cooking For Large Parties Can Be Difficult  But It's Incredibly Off Putting If Your Food Bleeds And You Don't Have The Stomach For That!,,,,,
,3784,Very Nice To Have Local Ale And Cider On Tap.,,,,,
,3787,The Edwardian Grill Was Pretty Good With The Exception Of An Eggy Thing With Asparagus That My Partner Had And Which Looked Vile. The Service In The Edwardian Grill Was Pretty Good Too.  The Same Could Not Be Said Of The Bistro - My Partner's Steak Was Ordered Medium And Arrived Very Rare. My Pasta With Pesto Had So Much Pesto On It It Was Inedible After A Couple Of Mouthfuls. After Our Plates Had Been Cleared Away Noone Came Near Our Table For Half An Hour  Despite A Gaggle Of Staff Chatting Together Not Too Far Away. I Eventually Gave Up Waiting For A Dessert Menu And We Got Up To Leave  At Which Point One Of Them Ran Over With A Bill To Sign. I Remarked Sarcastically That I Thought They Had All Gone Home  To Which He Laughed....  (As An Aside The Slightly Italian Looking Guy Who Wanders Around Was Fantastic From A Service Perspective).,,,,,
,3789,The Staff At The Castle Bistro Could Have Been Friendlier. We Found This On Our Last Visit As Well. Th Edwardian Was Excellent.,,,,,
,3792,Cant Wait To Come Back And Try Some More Of The Menu,,,,,
,3794,The Food Is Great Although The Service Lets It Down - Left For Long Periods Without Being Checked On.  Drinks Came After Starters Arrived And There Was Only 1/2Mins Between The Clearing Of The Starter And The Main Meal.,,,,,
,3795,Waiting Staff Did Not Seem To Have Any Knowledge Of Food Or Drink And We Waited A Very Long Time For Drinks.,,,,,
,3799,Had To Wait 40 Minutes To Get Coffee For Breakfast.  We Ordered Poached Eggs And The Order Never Came Even Though We Reminded Two Waitresses. A,,,,,
,3802,Other Than A Long Wait For Food On The Friday Evening (An Hour And A Half  It Was From The Take Away Menu In A Lodge) The Service I Received Was Fantastic.,,,,,
,3803,The Food Was Excellent And The Bistro Had A Varied Menu. The Service Was Prompt And Friendly  Nothing Was Too Much Hassle.,,,,,
,3807,The Staff Provided Excellent Service  Never Intrusive But Always On Hand If You Needed Anything.  The Food Was Expertly Prepared.,,,,,
,3810,The Wines Were Mixed Up And The Steaks Could Have Been More Tender  However The General Experience Was Good,,,,,
,3811,We Were Extremely Disappointed With The Food. It Was Overdone  And Again  Not Worth The Money We Paid For It.,,,,,
,3814,Whilst The Dinner Was Lovely  There Could Have Been A Bit More Of It - I Had The Fish Option For The Christmas Party. The Dessert Was As Described As 'Ganashe' But Was Too Sickly Sweet With No Cake Or Biscuit To Balance It - Even With The Sorbet. Mince Pies Were Delicious Though  And The Soup Starter Was Also Very Nice - But Could Have Done With A Bread Roll On The Side - Bigger Than The Tiny One That Was Given When First Seated.,,,,,
,3815,The Opposite Response Regarding The Bistro,,,,,
,3817,Had Over An Hour Wait Between Our Starter And Main Course. Was Told The Chef Was Not Satisfied With Plate-Up And Redid It  But This Was Not Believable. When Food Did Arrive  The Fish Was Slightly Undercooked And The Risotto Was Watery  Which Made It Feel Rushed As If Our Order Was Actually Forgotten Or Not Placed.,,,,,
,3820,Food And Service Was Great. Did Seem A Tad Odd That We Could Only Book A Table In The Grill For A Certain Time As Busy That Evening  But There Were Only Two Other Groups When We Actually Went In  Which Meant That The Atmosphere Was A Little Lacking. Pianist Was Great Though,,,,,
,3821,I Had The Serloin Steak And I Can Honestly Say It Was The Best Steak I Have Ever Had!,,,,,
,3823,Lovely Food And The Service Was Very Strong From Our Pre-Dinner Drinks All The Way Through Our Meal.  Only Minor Criticism Is That I Was Still Slightly Hungry After Three Courses - This Is Probably More Reflective Of Me Than The Food Provided Though!,,,,,
,3825,The Restaurant Layout Presented A Cold Atmosphere  And Coupled With Over Eager Yet Less Than Smooth Service We Felt That The Restaurant Let The Hotel Down.  Small Errors Were Made Here.,,,,,
,3827,The Staff Were Great And The Food Was Lovely However The We Were Left Feeling Hungry  We Are Used To Fine Dining And Realise Its About Quality Not Quantity But Perhaps A Little Extra On The Plate Wouldnt Hurt.,,,,,
,3837,Tables Quite Close Together So Didn't Feel As Relaxed As Could Have Been,,,,,
,3838,We Had A Snack Of Chips In The Bistro When We Arrived. Nice But We Were Not Given Any Cutlery Or Napkin. Food In Edwardian Grill Was Lovely,,,,,
,3839,We Did Experience Food Posiening After Eating From The Edwarian Restaurant But It Tasted Really Good So We Arent Sure That Was What Caused It But We Didnt Have Anything Else  But The Restaurant And Staff Are All Fantastic And We Didnt Complian To The Hotel As We Wasnt Sure,,,,,
,3850,Very Disappointed With The Length Of Time It Took To Serve Dinner On New Year's Eve. By The Time The Food Had Been Served  With The Disco Finishing So Early  The Evening Was Basically Over. The Food Options For Vegetarians Was Also Appalling.,,,,,
,3852,Well Done To The Staff - Very Attentive!!,,,,,
,3853,Issues With Length Of Time Taken For Food/Drinks To Arrive In Bistro (45 Mins For Bread) One Main Was Wrong  Another Underccooked.  This Was Discussed With The Hotel Manager; Not As A Complaint  But Because He Asked Us The Following Morning 'How Was Your Meal'.  Very Impressed 1) To Be Asked 2) How He Took Feedback 3) With Service & Standard In Edwrdian Grill. Problems In Bistro Were Possibly Down To The Fact That They Accommodated Our Reservation When Already Overbooked = A One Off,,,,,
,3854,The Bistro Was Fine And Used Often  Though Felt That The Edwardian Grill Let The Hotel Down A Little.Too Much Emphasis On Steak At The Expense Of Other Dishes (And The Steaks Were Overcooked  And One Sent Back).,,,,,
,3855,Food Was Excellent  As Per Previous Visits.  Service For Drinks Can Be A Little Slow.,,,,,
,3856,Such A Small Thing But An Indication Of What Was Vegetarian On The Menu (Mains And Desserts) Would Have Been Really Helpful - Otherwise Food Was Wonderful!,,,,,
,3858,Edwardian Grill Service Way Too Formal And Stuffy  A Bit Old Fashioned.  Castle Bistro Not In Keeping With Hotel - A Bit Uncomfortable And Canteen Like.  Menus Limited  Especially Bar And Cafe Bistro,,,,,
,3860,The Quality Of The Ingredients In The Edwardian Grill Were Very Good Particularly The Beef Which Was Excellent However  I Did Not Regard The Cooking Standard To Be Anywhere Near Michelin Star Level Hence I Gave It An Average Mark. The Service Was Good Particularly The French Gentlemen (I Believe He Was French)  Who Appeared To Know His Cheeses. I Marked The Service Down Slightly Though As The Gentlemen Who Was Pouring Wine/Water  Was A Bit Over Zealous Especially When We Tried To Pour A Glass For Ourselves Resulting In Him Running Over And Taking The Bottle From Us....Personally  I Find That A Bit Too Much Also  When I Enquired Where The Beef Was From And Breed Of Cattle  I Could Not Get An Answer On The Breed  Apart From A Guess And 'The Chef Would Probably Know'....Obviously It Was Too Much Trouble To Ask Him?,,,,,
,3863,The Castle Bistro Service Was Very Slow.,,,,,
,3865,Last Time We Stayed  There Was A Fine Dining Restaurant  Which I Really Enjoyed.  This Time The Only Option For Finer Dining Was The Edwardian Grill  While The Food Was Very Good  I Personally Find The Size Of The Room Intimidating  And Prefer The Intimacy Of A Smaller Room.,,,,,
,3866,The Service In The Castle Bistro Was Very Poor.,,,,,
,3867,We Also Dined At The Edwardian Grill Where We Found The Service And The Food To Be Outstanding.,,,,,
,3871,It Was On The Expensive Side  But Nice,,,,,
,3872,Edwardian Grill Main Issue With Not Living Up To Expectation. There Always Is A Menu Choice That May Not Pan Out  But I Found My Choices For Starter And Main Disappointing (Salmon Terrine And Brixham Brill Both Very Sour Tasting Due To Anchovy (Expected Salt!) And Lemon 'Scented' Potatoes). I Did Not Send Back Starter  But Did Send Back Main. Maybe It's My Palate On The Day  But Have Not Done That For A Long Time. On Top Price / Quality Is Not In Line. Price Would Suggest A Much Better Menu And Experience. Drinks Menu Overpriced Given Some Of Normal Quality Offered. Cheese Board Was Excellent Though  Staff Knowledge On That Lacking A Bit. Bistro From That Point Alltogether Much More In Line With Expectations And Therefore Definitely Better.    We Were Relatively Early And Up Front Urged To Book A Table. We Were The Only Ones  Leading To Food Coming Out Too Fast. And Sitting In That Space With Two People And Bunch Of Staff Looking On Does Not Aid Ambiance.   Overall Disappointing With Bistro Being Bit Of Weekend Saver.   ,,,,,
,3873,We Took Afternoon Tea On Arrival. I Informed The Waiter That I Was Vegetarian And Despite This 75% Of The Sandwiches Were Meat/Fish  So I Requested Another Sandwich  This Did Not Arrive.  It Would Have Been Thoughtful If My Requirements Had Been Considered When Making The Sandwiches. Dinner In The Bistro Was Excellent  Our Waiter Christopher Was Very Pleasant  The Chef Produced A Wonderful Vegetarian Meal  And A Menu Had Been Printed Out Just For Me  Excellent. ,,,,,
,3874,Way Overpriced For The Experience And Not Easy To Understand Menu  Would Not Dine Again Although Would Maybe Use Spa.,,,,,
,3877,Some Staff Did Not Understand Basic English Requests. Food And Service Was Extremely Slow And Very Sporadic  Some Items Took 45 Minutes To Arrive.  There Seemed To Be Lots Of Staff Floating Around But With No Direction Or Chain Of Command.,,,,,
,3878,Many Of The Staff Seemed Harrassed And Not Clear On Who Should Be Doing What. A Number Were Quite Abrupt And This Was Both In The Evening And At Breakfast Service And In The Bar.  Our Main Courses  Particularly The Steaks And The Beef Pie Were Tough On Both Evenings And Steaks Were Poorly Cooked On Both Evenings.  As It Is Supposed To Be The Restaurant's Speciality It Was Extremely Disappointing.  The Restaurant Food Is Over-Priced For The Standard We Experienced And Particularly As It Is Clear You Use Cheap Cuts Of Meat Eg Ox Cheek  Ox Tail  The Cuts Used In The Beef Pie Etc.,,,,,
,3880,The Bistro Decor Is Tacky And The Food Was Disgusting. I Am Very Unhappy That We Were Charged For It  Despite Making It Clear That We Thought It Was Poor. The Food At The Edwardian Grill Was Not Well Executed; The Crab Dish Was Full Of Shell. I Did Call Several Days Prior To Our Arrival To Let The Hotel Know That We Did Not Eat Meat And To Request That This Be Discussed With The Chef. Reception Assured Me That This Was All In Hand But We Subsequently Found Out That The Chef Had Not Been Notified  And Our Consequent Menu Choices Were Extremely Limited.,,,,,
,3881,The Bistro Fish Cakes Were A Bit Disappointing  Too Much Potato  Not Enough Fish. In The Edwardian Grill- I Had Fabulous Fillet Steak  But Unfortunately My Husbands Was Not So Good  He Was Offered An Alternative  But That Came Over Cooked.,,,,,
,3883,Breakfast Was Amazing!,,,,,
,3885,The Service Cab Tend To Be A Bit Slow.  I Think It Woudl Help To Have More Staff In The Bat Pre-Dinner As It Was A Bit Tedious Waiting At Times.  Also The Gap Between The Courses Was Far Too Long,,,,,
,3889,We Stayed On A Dinner  Bed & Breakfast Rate Card But At No Point Were We Talked Too About Options Or Limitations. At Dinner We Were First Handed The A La Carte Menu And Then The 3 Course Menu But With No Commentary. We Selected From The A La Carte And Subsequently On Check Out The Cost Of This Meal Was Added To Our Bill Outwith The Dbb Costs.,,,,,
,3893,Breakfast Not As Good As Dinner. Breakfast Either Overcooked Or Had Been Around A While,,,,,
,3895,Food Was Good  Atmosphere In Both Even Meal On The Sunday (In Bistro) And Breakfast On Both Days Was Very Poor.  Need Low Background Music When Resteraunts Are So Quiet.,,,,,
,3899,Curtain Falling Down In Private Dining Room!,,,,,
,3900,The Edwardian Grill Was Overly Hot Which Made It A Little Stuffy.  But That's A Small Complaint!,,,,,
,3901,We Thought The Bar Area In The Evening Was Particularly Lovely - Great View  Wonderful Ambiance And Very Helpful And Pleasant Staff.  Overall The Food Was Very Enjoyable  A Couple Of Items Were Perhaps Not As Hot As They Might Have Been.,,,,,
,3903,The Edwardian Grill Limited Choice As I Do Not Eat Beef  This Meant I Could Only Choose From A Limited Fish Menu. The Castle Bistro Was Under Staffed For A Busy Restaurant. Only Two Waitresses And One Barman Meant A Long Wait Between Courses. The Prices On The A La Carte Breakfast Menu Were Confusing As We Were Unable To Tell Whether This Option Was Included In The Bed And Breakfast Rate Or Whether It Was An Additional Cost. Also  We Were Asked Four Times For Our Room Number One Breakfast Morning - Twice By The Same Waiter! ,,,,,
,3905,Service Inthe Bistro Was Very Poor,,,,,
,3906,The Service In The Edwardian Grill Was Terrible. Service In Castle Bistro Was Great. Service In Rooms Like Adams Room And Oak Bar Was Very Sporadic. One Day  We Were Asked Many Times If We Wanted/Needed Anything - Another Day We Had To Wait And Wait Until We Finally Got Up And Ordered Ourselves.,,,,,
,3907,Again  The Service Let The Restaurant Down. The Waiter In The Edwardian Grill Did Not Know The Menu And I Felt The Attention Given To Us Was Sporadic.  We Were 1.5H Late Getting Our Table/Food But This Was Addressed By Federico.,,,,,
,3908,I Could Not Fault The Two Evenings That We Ate In The Bistro Or The Bar For Lunch.  However  The Edwardian Was A Very Disappointing Experience.  Our Portions Sizes Were Incredibly Small For The Money (Especially My Mother In Laws Pork Belly)  And The Service Lacked The Attention To Detail That You Would Expect And Certainly Charge For.,,,,,
,3909,Very Limited Menu At The Bistro. Surely This Could Be Expanded Without Too Much Effort ? See Limewood Hotel New Forest For Superlative Bistro (The Scullery) Menu. Variable Service At Breakfast. Patronisingly Told That English Breakfast Is Already On The Buffet  Upon Commenting That There Was No Black Pudding  I Received A Shrug  Likewise My Request For Fried Bread Was Ignored/Forgotten. Very Fresh Patisserie Offerings And Great Tasting And Plentiful Coffee  Delicious Yoghurt However.,,,,,
,3910,Dinner In The Edwardian Grill Was A Major Letdown. We Were Seated And Then Not Offered A Wine List Or Introduction To The Sommelier. It Took For 45 Mins For Our Main To Arrive (By Which Time I Was Very Hungry) And The Risotto Was Underdone And Tasted Of Starch As A Result. There Was No Engagement With Us By The Maitre'd Or Waiting Staff. The Menu Lacked Imagination  Breakfast Was A Big Disappointment And Vastly Over-Priced. My Salmon And Scambled Eggs Looked Like The Eggs Were Taken From The Hot Serving Bins Rather Than Being Freshly Made. My Wife's 'Hot Cakes' Were One Pancake And A Couple Of Bits Of Fruit For £16.,,,,,
,3911,Expensive For The Quality,,,,,
,3913,I Think The Look And Feel Of The Edwardian Grill Could Be Updated.,,,,,
,3914,The Service Was Painfully Slow And Disorganized. Twice At Breakfast We Had Finished Our Continental Breakfast And Were Ready To Leave Before Our Tea Was Delivered. Our Wine Was Served After Our Main Course At Dinner. At The Bistro  We Told The Server We Needed The Bill Because We Wanted To Go For A Walk Before Dark. Ten Minutes Later It Hadn't Come And She Was At The Bar Chatting With Someone.,,,,,
,3915,There Was A Limited Choice In The Castle Bistro With No Emphasis On 'Healthy Options' - There Were No Cakes Available And There Was Only One Waitress In The Bistro Servicing Many Tables - We Had To Wait For One Hour In The Edwardian Grill On The Second Night For Our Meal But The Following Night Just 15 Minutes - So Variable But Pleasant,,,,,
,3917,Disappointing! We Dined In The Bistro On The Friday Night (£30 Per Person Incl In Room Rate Booked On Secret Escapes).  We Were Warned There Could Be A Wait For The Food (This Was At 9Pm At Night - Hardly Peak Hour For Diners I Wouldn't Have Thought?!). Our Drink Orders Were Forgotten. Our Cutlery Was Cleared With The Starters And Not Replaced For The Main. Service Was Very Slow. Otherwise Food Was Ok. ( Starters Were The Best). Menu Selection Was Limited ( Couldn't Even Order A Salad).  On Saturday Dinner In The Edwardian Restaurant. Food Was Good. Service Again Very Slow And Not Professional. Waitress Returned To Our Table For Desert Order And Just Stared At Us. Then Said. 'Oh Yeah. Would You Like Desert?' We Both Ordered Steak. One Rare And One Medium. Both Were Over-Cooked. Room Completely Lacked Ambience.  Also To Mention Breakfast- Poor Selection. Service Incredibly Slow And Inefficient. Second Morning We Had To Wait 10Mins For A Table To Be Set ( Even Though Plenty Of Empty Tables That Had Not Been Cleared Yet),,,,,
,3918,To Be Honest The Food Was Good  But Not Excellent.  The Service Was Good But Very Old Fashioned. Somehow It Lacked A Sense Of Humour If That Makes Sense.  London Dining Is So Different.  Much More Slick.  It All Seemed Quite Over Priced.  If I Compare It You A Restaurant I Went To In London On Monday It Doesn't Come Out Very Well.  It Was Double The Price  The Food Wasn't As Good And It Was Lacking Atmosphere.,,,,,
,3921,The Room Was Cold And Noisey.  One Of The Waiters On Both The Evenings We Ate There Kept Staring And Hovering,,,,,
,3924,Dined For 2 Nights In The Bistro.  1St Night  Service Was Excellent  Couldn't Fault It.  2Nd Night  Poor Service  Long Wait For Dessert Which Never Turned Up. Not Sure If There Was Lack Of Staff Or Something Else.,,,,,
,3927,A More Well Rounded  Tasty Veggie Option?. Otherwise All Was Good  Childrens Meals Were Great And Always Finished!.,,,,,
,3930,There Was A Fly In My Glass Of Red Wine And So I Pointed It Out To The Waitress  Who Kindly Replaced The Glass And Poured Fresh Wine From The Bottle But No Gesture Towards The Fact That A Whole Glass Of Wine Was Wasted!,,,,,
,3931,I Did Find That My Steak Was A Little More Done Than I Would Have Expected For Medium Cooked But It Was Ok. I Did However Find That The Mushroom And The Beans Were Very Salty And I Couldn't Finish The Meal Because Of That. At Breakfast Time I Did Notice  As Did Many Others In Our Group  That The Breakfast Was Rather Cold. As I Did Not Go To Sleep At All The Previous Night Due To Partying  I Was Up Very Early And Pretty Much Went In For Breakfast Soon After Service Started So I Can't Really Give Service The Excuse That I Was One Of The Last To Come Down,,,,,
,3932,Edwardian Grill Was Very Sterile In Atmosphere. It Could Have Had Some Quiet Background Music As We Could Over Hear The Conversation Of The Nearby Tables Without Trying.,,,,,
,3934,Over Priced. Issues With Salt In Pepper Pot So Had To Send Smoked Salmon Back  When It Came Back There Was A Bone In It My Friend Nearly Swallowed. The Wine  Brought To Us By Someone Who Claimed To Run The Wine Tasting Events  Was Off. She Hadn't Noticed The Colour Or Smell  Making Me Wonder How Good The Wine Tasting Events Could Be. Manager Didn't Seem T Want To Discuss The Matter When Informed Of All The Problems. He Did However Take Some Money Off Our Bill The Next Day (Which Didn't Even Add Up To The Service % We Were Charged).,,,,,
,3935,We Were Stuck In A Tiny Room Next To A Corporate Dinner For 30. We Couldn't Hear Each Other Speak - And It Was My Wifes 40Th Birthday. So Not Ideal.,,,,,
,3936,Service On The Friday Night And Sunday Morning Was Abysmal.,,,,,
,3937,For Breakfast Why Do All The Tables Point Away From The Beautiful View? Dinning Room Lacked Some Character Compared To Rest Of Hotel,,,,,
,3938,Service Was Abominable.,,,,,
,3940,Unfortunately The Restaurant Could Not Cope With The Demand Over Easter And Some Excellent Food Was Let Down By Disorganised Service. I Also Think  Given The Hotels Status  A More Experienced Chef Would Be A Good Investment.,,,,,
,3942,We Asked For One Duck To Be Medium The Other Rare.  Both Arrived Rare With No Comment. We Asked For A Potatoes On The Second Night.  They Never Arrived. We Had Toasted Teacakes On Our First Afternoon And They Were Cold.,,,,,
,3943,Challenging Menu  Particularly If You Eat On Several Occasions Eg. No Chicken Or Beef On The Menu.  Dishes Overly Elaborate And Potentially Beyond The Skill Of The Kitchen.  I Would Offer Some Simpler Dishes On The Menu Eg. A Really Excellent Fillet Steak Or Chateaubriand  An Excellent Dover Sole,,,,,
,3944,The Service In The Bistro Was A Little Slow!  The Staff Took 40 Mins To Clear Our Table Of Empty Glasses And Plates  A Little More Attention To Detail Is Required  Especially As There Were Three Staff On Duty And It Was Quiet.,,,,,
,3949,We Were Offered The Library For Pre Dinner Drinks But Were Not Told About The Service Charge This Would Occur For Each Drink  We Would Have Had This In The Bar Had We Been Made Aware. We Didn't Order Petit Fours But Received Them And Obviously It Was Added To Our Bill. I Have Stated And Worked In Hotels For Many Years And Have Never Experienced This  Rather Cheeky I Thought!  The Birthday Cake Was A Lovely Touch  A Little Dampened By The Unnecesary Petit Fours And Service Charges Though!,,,,,
,3951,We Were Treated To Dining In The Library As We Were The Only Guests And It Was Our Wedding Anniversary. The Experience Was Quite Overwhelming And Very Special. The Staff Were Amazing And Very Considerate As We Were Trying To Deal With A Screaming Baby That Did Not Share Our Enthusiasm For A Romantic Quiet Meal. Please Pass On My Thanks For The Professionalism And Understanding Of The Staff. We Must A Have Been A Headache To Them.,,,,,
,3952,Our Lunch In The Bistro Was Very Good  Dinner In The Edwardian With Pre-Dinner Drinks In The Bar Was Superb  And Afternoon Tea Was As Yummy As Always - Thank You To Chef For The Wheat Free Selection.,,,,,
,3953,When Charging The Prices That Bovey Does The Dining Experience Certainly Needs To Up Its Game,,,,,
,3954,Edwardian Grill Dining Was Superb Except For The Lack Of Wine Knowledge.  The Bistro Fayre Was Appalling.  Hence The Average Scoring Above.,,,,,
,3955,If We Would Of Been Informed Of Our Deal Regarding Food  We Would Of Eaten In The Edwardian Grill Both Nights,,,,,
,3956,As We Never Recieved Any Information Regarding Our Meal Arrangements We Would Of Done Things Differently On Reflexion Of The Bill,,,,,
,3962,Thought The Price Of The 3 Course Sunday Lunch Was Very Reasonable,,,,,
,3963,Great Service; Professional Yet Personal.,,,,,
,3964,The Fri Night At The Bistro Was Lovely  And The Food All As You Would Expect With Some Nice Wine Selection.  Wish We Went There For The Sat Instead Of The Ed Wardian Grill.  The Ed Griill Was Not 5 Star Dining  The Food Was Nice But Not Cooked To Perfection You Would Expect For Fine Dining.  Also The Staff Were Not Friendly  Apart From The One Member Of Staff.  Felt More Like A Standard Run Of A Mill Hotel Instead Of Fine Dining And 5 Star Appeal.,,,,,
,3965,The Wine Watress Was Excellent - Very Friendly And Developed A Rapport.  Felt That The Other Staff Were A Bit Cold And Not That Friendly.  Automatically Adding 15% To Bill For Food And 5% For Accommodation On Check Out Without First Asking Was Inappropriate.,,,,,
,3967,Food Was Cold And Poor New Years Food. Bistro New Year's Eve Lunch Poor.,,,,,
,3970,I Thought The Breakfast Service Was Verging On Inept. Some Of The Breakfast Spoke Almost No English And Seemed To Understand Very Little. The Cooked Breakfasts Took Too Long And The Coffee Was Not Hot Enough.,,,,,
,3974,The Cafe Bistro Incongruous To The Rest Of The Surroundings.,,,,,
,3975,The Edwardian Grill Was Wonderful And The Sommelier Was Excellent At His Wine Selections! The Bistro Was Perfect For Children It Would Be Nice To Have Another Middle Option As An Alternative To The Bistro.,,,,,
,3981,In The Grill We Had To Return More Than One Meal Because It Was Not Cooked Correctly  One Meal Was Cold And One Dessert Was Contained Unripe Fruit Which Made It Impossible To Eat  The Service Was Also Very Slow.  The Food In The Bistro Was Better But We Still Had To Return One Course!,,,,,
,3982,We Had To Request A Hand Bowl For Use After A Serving Of Mussels. Also Needed To Request A Steak Knife For Use For A Steak. The Staff Were Helpful In Acquiring These Items  However  I Would Have Expected Them To Know That They Were Required.,,,,,
,3983,The Food Was Nice But Over-Priced And Had We Not Had Pudding We Would Have Left Feeling Hungry.  Also Very Frustrated The Next Morning When We Had Our Bill And Found Out That A Bottle Of Still Water Cost £4.50!,,,,,
,3984,I Chose To Dine In The Bistro As I Felt My Husband Would Have More Choice However It Was More Like An Upmarket Leisure Centre Cafe. A Very Limited Menu With An Ice Cream Fridge Serving Cones!,,,,,
,3986,The Staff In The Castle Bistro Were Nice But Inexperienced  Lacking In Proper Waiting Training And Detracted From The Overall Dining Experience. E.G. Didn't Have A Wine List Or Know What Wine They Had  When Brought To The Table Didn't Offer A Taste To Ensure It Was Ok - Things I Would Expect As A Matter Of Course Given The Quality Of The Hotel. The Menu Was Also Rather Limited.,,,,,
,3992,Staff Was Unprofessional,,,,,
,3993,The Menu Could Be A Little More Interesting.,,,,,
,3994,5 Star Hotel And Setting But Not 5 Star Food On This Occasion.,,,,,
,3995,The Bistro Really Lacks Atmosphere Which Is A Shame And Most Of The Staff Are Great But A Few Really Let Them Down As They Are So Surly And Borderline Rude!,,,,,
,3996,She Had A Steak And Asked For Well Done  The Steak Was Very Bad. I Know That The Chefs Do Not Like To Do Well Done. But Really If That Is Want The Customer Wants Then It Should Be Good. Especially Since The Steak Is Something You Seem So Proud Of In Your Menu.   The Cheese Board You Offer Was Really Something Special!,,,,,
,3997,Superb Staff,,,,,
,3998,The Organization Of The Restaurant Staff Is Very Poor Idea  They Dont Really Know What They Are Doing  They Are Not Efficient Or Very Friendly.  Chaos Reigns In The Dining Room Was My Take Out,,,,,
,3999,We Were Sent The Wrong Dessert Wine Initially  Then Had To Wait A Very Long Time For The Replacement  By Which Point We'd Eaten Our Dessert.  We Weren't Charged For The Dessert Wine However.  Also  We Had Our Coffees And Petit Fours In One Of The Lounges And Discovered The Box Of Petit Fours Was Empty. This Was Rectified However Once We Mentioned It To One Of The Staff.,,,,,
,4000,There Were No Gluten Free Options Indicated  Limited Choice For Someone Pregnant And We Consider The Prices Rather Steep.  You Can Eat A Full Tasting Menu At The Michelin Starred Elephant In Torquay For Less. Excellent Quality Beef Used In The Mains And Beautifully Cooked. Desserts Were Disappointing And A Description Of The Strawberries And Cream Dessert Looked Like It Would Be A Deconstructed Pudding With Mousse  Jelly  Panna Cotta On The Plate Not A Slice  Also Desserts Were Not Seasonal. The View From The Edwardian Grill Is Exceptional But All The Breakfast Tables Are Positioned With The Chairs Facing Away Fom The View And Towards The Kitchen - What A Waste Of Such A Naturally Breathtaking Scene.,,,,,
,4003,Lovely Atmosphere In The Restaurant And The Service Was Great. Lovely Waiter From Slovenia.,,,,,
,4004,We Booked A Bed&Breakfast&Dine Package And Had A Three Course Menue Included; Compared To Other Excellent Hotel/Restaurants In The World (Mandarin Oriental  Miami 6* Or Banyan Tree  Bangkok  5*) I Would Only Rate The Overall Eating Experience Fair. The Staff Was Very Attentive And Friendly And The Food Was All In All Good - But The Expectations From Whole Image You Provide Yours Guests With Were Not Met In The End; Especially The Breakfast Was Disappointing - After Our Dinner I Was At Least Expecting Some Of The Lovely Homebaked Rolls For Breakfast But You Only Offered One Boring Loaf Of Bread And The Rest Was Toast And A Relatively Average Arrangement Of Fruit  Cereals  Etc; Compared To Some Of The Hotels And Even B&Bs We Stayed During Our Two Week Visit In The Uk Your Breakfast Was Alright But Not More; Sorry To Say That!,,,,,
,4005,All Great Apart From The Creme Brûlée Desert. It Was Not A Creme Brûlée. It Was Mouse On A Shortbread Biscuit. Not Very Nice . Why Say Its A Creme Brûlée When It Isn't T.,,,,,
,4008,It's Hard To Cut Fennel With A Fish Knife!,,,,,
,4009,The Food Wasn't Hot Enough  Barely Warm. Not As Good As Last Years. I Believe You Have A New Chef. It Was A Real Let Down  Because This Is One Thing We Love  Food! I Thought It Lacked Decoration And Very Very Small. Compared To Last Year. Parsely Was Added For Decoration At Breakfast Last Year  Which Added Colour  Not This Year And For Dinner On The Meat. Very Dissapointed. My Partners Lamb Was Almost Cold  My Venison Warm/ Boardering On Cold. Not What To Be Expected.,,,,,
,4014,We Have Stayed And Eaten At Bovey Castle Three Times Over The Last Five Years. Unfortunately The Service For Both Dinner And Breakfast Was Very Average On This Visit  Where It Has Been Excellent In Previous Trips. The Desert Was Very Disappointing And Poor,,,,,
,4020,Firstly Felt The Dining Experience Was Not To The Standard Of The Hotel. It Was Good Food Not A Dining Experience On Par With The Hotel Experience. I Was Particularly Disappointed When My Partridge Dish Very Under Cooked To My Taste And Completely Covered In Blood From The Shot In The Breast And Looked Ghastly On My Plate. I Didn't Want A Replacement So Quietly Mentioned To The Waiter How Both The Unpleasant Look And Flavour Were Not For Me But No Acknowledgment Was Made By Staff Or Chef Or An Apology Offered. I Am Not A Fussy Eater And Have Dined Extensively And Much Smaller Complaints Have Been Dealt With More Synpathetically.,,,,,
,4023,Breakfast Service Seemed A Little Disorganized.  We Had To Wait A While For A Table And When We Got Our Toast There Was No Butter.  Also No Salt On The Table.  Wedding Food Was Excellent.,,,,,
,4025,This Is A True Lovely Venue And We Had A Fantastic Time. All Of The Staff Were Friendly And Approachable And Had A Very Polite Manner About Them Even Whilst Trying To Keep A Large Party To The Schedule.,,,,,
,4026,[See Previous Comment.],,,,,
,4027,I`M Sure You Have Had Feedback About The American Themed Meal On The Sunday Night- Again A Big Disappointment   Chicken Wings – Very Difficult To Eat   The Burger Was Cumbersome & The Waffle Seemed Stale & Rock Hard – I Also Found A Stale Bread Role By My Foot At The Dinner Table.     The Meal At The Awards Ceremony On Monday Lunch Was Very Good & Reassured Me That Bovey Did Have Some Good Hospitality Points To Offer. Although Red Wine Was Served Into My White Wine Glass.  ,,,,,
,4033,The Sunday Buffet Was Covered Up  And Not Obvious What Was Available To Eat.  I Started By Being Given A Sunday Pork Lunch To Then See There Were Salads  And Carved Meat At The End Of The Circular Table Which Would Have Been My Preference.  Looking Around I Saw Plenty Of People With A Sunday Lunch And Vegetables On The Their Plate With Salad And Fish Mixed In As They Obviously Hadn't Been Shown What Was Available Either!  It Was Poorly Laid Out. Sunday Dinner Sticky Chicken Wings  Burger And Chips Was An Inappropriate Meal To Have When Dining With Strangers And Industry Peers.  Eating With Your Fingers  Getting Messy And No Finger Bowls Was Not Ideal And Slightly Embarrassing When Trying To Talk About Business With Industry Peers.  After Dinner We Were Asked If We Wanted Tea Or Coffee  Some People Asked For Cappuccino Or Expresso To Be Told 'No You Can Only Have Filer Coffee Or Everyone Would Want One' That Was Very Embarrassing! Monday Lunch Was Very Nice.,,,,,
,4037,The Food Was Excellent But There Was Not Enough Of It. The Smoked Salmon Starter Was Too Small And The Beef Needed Vegetables To Go With It.,,,,,
,4038,Sadly One Of Our Meals Was Very Disappointing  I Did Report This To The Waitress Who Said She Would Go And Speak With The Chef She Went  Into The Kitchen And Never Returned. We Felt This Was A Shame As It Did Somewhat Ruin Our Stay,,,,,
,4041,The Bistro Menu Was The Same For Lunch And Dinner And Did Not Offer Many Healthy Choices. The Staff In The Bistro Seemed Confused And Unsure Of The Food They Served. Edwardian Was Excellent And Staff Extremely Sharp. Delicious Food At Edwardian.,,,,,
,4045,All Dining Facilities And Room Service Was Great.,,,,,
,4046,Shame About The Service At Times,,,,,
,4049,Saturday Morning Was A Bit Manic But We Survived. Shame That We Were On Our Own For Sunday Lunch It Was Excellent So Those That Didnt Dine Missed Out,,,,,
,4050,Above Was For The Bistro Only. The Edwardian Grill And Oak Bar We Would All Rate As Excellent,,,,,
,4052,I Thought The Service For Drinks And Wine Were Appalling For An Establishment Of This Nature.  We Had To Wait 35 Minutes For Pre-Dinner Drinks!!!  Also  The Wine Waiter Did Not Fill Our Glasses Once Throughout Our Meal And We Found It Difficult To Get The Attention Of Staff When We Required More Drinks.,,,,,
,4053,Overpriced Dry Sandwiches,,,,,
,4056,Food In The Bistro Was Pretty Poor. Ok In The Grill  But Not Fantastic. Service Was Hit And Miss,,,,,
,4057,Service (Particularly In The Bistro) Was Slow - The Individual Staff Members Were Fabulous  My Feeling Was That Staffing Levels Were A Bit Low Relative To The Number Of Guests.,,,,,
,4058,Could Waiters/Waitresses Refrain From Clearing Plates Until Everyone Has Finished?  So Impolite To Do Otherwise.,,,,,
,4062,I Was Impressed That We Were Asked To Submit Dietary Requirements Well Before Arrival.,,,,,
,4067,Edwardian Room...Weakest Part Of Experience....Chairs Broken And Not Very Elegant Like The Other Rooms....No Atmosphere....Also Food Just So So.  Bistro Patio Beautiful But Service Waiters Bad...Inside Bistro Ugly And Food Bad,,,,,
,4068,A Bit Short Staffed In The Bar. Apart From That All Good.,,,,,
,4069,Very Good - A Little Crazy At Breakfast Staff Seemed A Little Over Whelmed But Dinner Excellent,,,,,
,4070,The Bistro Was Excellent And The Chef Was Very Helpful With Getting Out The Childrens Meals First.  Unfortunately We Were Let Down By The Edwardian Grill Not Bringing Everyone's Meals Out At The Same Time (Three People Waited 10 Minutes More For Their Mains Including One Of The Vegetables That Went With A Main That Came Out Previously).  Breakfast Was Equally Disappointing In The Grill  I Asked For Hard Eggs In The Eggs Benedict And They Came Out With Even The White Runny - I Sent This Back And The Same Plate Was Delivered Back To Me With Nothing Done To It.  I Had To Chase My Childs Breakfast Four Times Before It Came And Then It Came Out Warm Not Hot (Which Is Obviously Fine For A Child But Not How It Should Have Been Served),,,,,
,4071,Very Nice To Have The Choice Of Formal Or Relaxed Dining Facilities. Afternoon Tea Was Plentiful And Tasty  With The Only Criticism Being  From Someone Who's Not A Great Fan Of Cream  That There Was Very Restricted Non-Creamy Choice Of Cakes.,,,,,
,4073,Service At The Bistro Was Very Slow & Disorganised.,,,,,
,4075,The Edwardian Grill Experience Was Very Good. Dining In The Bistro Is Only Fair. The Bistro Lacks Atmosphere And The Quality Of The Pizzas Are Not Good.,,,,,
,4076,The Staff Is Friendly But Inexperienced. It Seems There Are Lots Of Students And I Do Not Feel That Charding 12.5% As Service Is Normal Considering This,,,,,
,4079,The Food Was Excellent And The Service Was Extremely Attentive. Some Might Have Considered The Service A Little Overwhelming (Mid-Week Dinner Was Rather Quiet So The Staff Were Far From Stretched)  But I Found It Perfectly Fine,,,,,
,4080,I Don't Remember The Name Of The Young Lady That Served Us But She Was Exceptional In Her Role  She Made Us Feel Very At Ease With Just The Right Amount Of Interaction (Not Interuption) You Could Tell She Was Very Highly Skilled In Her Role As Although Her Maner Was Very Light With Myself And My Wife Whilst We Watched The Bistro In Action She Directed The Staff Very Well With A Direct Approach. We Were Very Impressed With The Ease That She Switched Between Roles Of Serving And Managing. We Ate At 8Pm On Monday 3Rd December  If You Are Able To Pass On Our Thanks To Her For Making Our Meal Pleasuarable.,,,,,
,4081,We Didnt Think The Bistro Fitted In With The Rest Of The Castle. The Food Was Good But The Coffee Size Was Too Small And A Large Coffee Wasnt Possible For Some Reason. The Table Next To Us Was Filthy And Food Was All Over The Floor Which Wasnt Cleaned Up In The Hour And A Half We Were There.,,,,,
,4085,I Was Very Surprised That I Enjoyed My Meal At The Bistro  Probably Because We Were Shown The Edwardian Grill And Were Told How Great It Was And Then Shown The Bistro And Again Made To Feel It Was A Bit Inferior  So Again It Was Not Really 'Sold' To Us And That Is Where Our Meal Was Booked  So Generally We Felt That We Were Getting The Second Best  However I Really Enjoyed The Meal We Had There  The Staff Were Friendly And We Had A Chat With Some Of The Other Guests And It Was Relaxing And Fun,,,,,
,4086,Menu Was Very Limited,,,,,
,4088,When We Made Our Reservation In The Afternoon For The Same Night  We Were Told That We Just Got The Last Table. When We Actually Arrived In The Bistro  It Was Half Empty. We Were Suprised About This Circumstance.,,,,,
,4090,The Restaurant Flet Like A Motorway Restaurant,,,,,
,4092,The Food Was Terrible At Bovey Castle. We Were So Disappointed. One Of The Reasons That People Go To A Country House Hotel Is To Have An Enjoyable Food Experience. Because Of The Lack Of Good Food We Didn't Feel Like We Were Having The 5 Star Experience That We Were Promised. We Didn't Try The Edwardian Grill As We Were Not Confident That The Food Would Be Good. Breakfast Was A Farce. The Wait Staff Were Totally Inexperienced And Any Food Ordered From The Menu Would Always Show Up Cold. Getting A Pot Of Coffee Was Also A Painful Experience. We Often To Have To Ask Three Times Before We Got One. The Bistro Was Also Seriously Bad.,,,,,
,4093,I Wasn't Aware Of The Dress Code For The Edwardian Grill (Although That Makes Sense)  So We Didn't Dine There.  In Addition That Menu Was Extremely Carnivorous  I Would Have Expected Some Other Selections As Well As Some More Local Fare (Fish  Poultry)  I Remember The Menu Being Almost Exclusively Beef.,,,,,
,4095,1St Night  1St Impression Not Very Welcoming  Waited To Be Seated But No One Helped Went Over To The Bar Area To Ask If Possible For Dinner. Could Have Been Cleaner. Slow Service From Order To Serve  Which Is Difficult With Children. We Arrived Around 5.30Pm.,,,,,
,4096,We Hjad Guests To Dinner For Our Wedding Anniversary And We All Commented On The Excellent Food And The Value For Money  The Service Was Also Excellent And The Chef Was Obviously Passionate About His Job.,,,,,
,4102,Bland Food Terrible Chips Bland Fish Cakes Cold Room No Atmosphere,,,,,
,4103,The Bistro Is The Weak Link,,,,,
,4104,Again It Felt That The Service Here Had Deteriorated Since Our Last Stay. We May Have Been Unlucky But Service Was Very Slow And Unfriendly. For This Reason We Only Dined Here Once. But Full Credit The Food Was Excellent But Given The Restaurant Prices I Would Expect This.,,,,,
,4106,The Menu In The Castle Bistro Is Very Limited With No Healthy Choices For Mains  Two Shellfish Meals And No Fish  Except Deep Fried. So It's Burgers Or Pizzas! For The Standard Of He Food It Was Very Expensive  Over £100 For A Family Of 4 Every Time We Went! It Needs To Be Cheaper Or A Lot Better!,,,,,
,4110,We Thought It Was A Bit Overpriced.,,,,,
,4111,The Menu Could Have Done With Being More Extensive As We Had Lunch There Earlier In The Day Then We Dined Later But Didn't Realise We Would Have The Same Menu Choices.,,,,,
,4113,We Had About 8 People Serving Us - Which Was Ridiculous. We Got Asked If Wanted Bread About 12 Times - It Is Now A Running Joke Between My Husband And I. Just To Serve Our Plates Took 2 People - One Of Whom Seemed To Just Be Watching!? Honestly I Think There Were More Staff Than Customers In The Restaurant. The Food Was Average.,,,,,
,4114,Due To The Closure Of The Bistro We Ate Our Supper A Bistro Menu In The Edwardian Grill. All The Staff Were Excellent And The Meal Was Superb,,,,,
,4115,Outstanding! Service Provided By Waiting Staff Was Excellent As Was The Quality Of Food And Surroundings. All Staff Made Great Effort To Accomodate My Wifes Food Allergies Which Was Appreciated.,,,,,
,4117,Very Strange That The Waiting Area Was In The Same Room Without Any Screening. To Take Your Dinning To The Next Level Requires Waiting Staff To Announce And Talk Through The Food They Are Presenting.,,,,,
,4121,The Fillet Steak Ordered In The Main Restaurant Came Out Extremely Well Done (A Medium Steak Had Been Requested But It Was Not Even Slightly Pink. We Thought Afterwards That Maybe We Should Have Mentioned This To The Waiter At The Time.,,,,,
,4124,Due To Pregnancy  I Returned The Pink Duck And The Runny Egg As I Forgot To Say They Needed To Be Cooked Thouroughly. This Was Done Quickly.,,,,,
,4126,The Quality Of The Food Was Not A Five Star/Slh Conferm And Absolutely To Expansive. The Golf Grill Doesn't Fit With The Atmosphere Of A Castle. The Breakfast Was A Catastrophy  Because The Bacon Was Old And Smelt  The Latte Was Not Drinkable.,,,,,
,4129,Too Formal An Atmosphere,,,,,
,4130,My Wife And I Felt That The Food Let The Whole Experiance Down. Breakfast Was Dissapointing And The Quality Of The The Food In General Did Not Match Up To The High Standard Of The Hotel.For The Price That Is Being Charged You Would Expect Better!,,,,,
,4133,Lovely Food. A Bit Pricey Though. £15 For Starters And £10 Desserts Was A Bit On The Expensive Side  But The Food Was Lovely  And Our Waitress Was Really Friendly.,,,,,
,4135,My Partner Is A Vegetarian And Usually Struggles When We Eat Out But Your Staff Made Him Feel Very Welcome And He Very Much Enjoyed His Meal.,,,,,
,4140,Excellent - The Beef Wellington & Steak We Had Were Just Superb. Monsieur Le Sommelier Was Also Very Helpful And Looked After Us Really Well.,,,,,
,4143,The Dining Experience Was Not Good. We Experienced Cold Food And Friendly But Poor Levels Of Service - Neither Acceptable At The Prices Charged - Especially When 12.5% Service Is Charged By Default. There Appears To Be Noone In Charge Of The Restaurant. Staff Were Inexperienced And Disorganised,,,,,
,4144,The New Screens In The Edwardian Dining Room Make A Big Difference. The Room Now Feels Much Cosier Than Before.,,,,,
,4147,Although I Have Had A Terrible Experiance With What Happened With The Meat  I Still Have To Say That Everything Is Very Excellent In Every Way Other Than The Fact A Waiter Had Told Me My Meat Dish Was Vegetarian  This Was Disgraceful But That Does Not Alter My View On The Quality And Presentation Which Is Absolutely Fantastic.,,,,,
,4148,The Edwardian Grill Is Very Expensive,,,,,
,4149,Our Dining Experience Was Superb. We Haven't Been For 2 Years And In Previous Years The Dining Experience Was Fine But Nothing Special. This Time With The New Chef It Was Outstanding. I Cant Remember The Last Time I Had Such Good Food.,,,,,
,4151,Generally We Like The Hotel Very Much But Feel The Dining Room Is Understaffed And As A Result The Service Is Slow. There Is Also A Very Long Wait Between Courses So It Takes At Least A Couple Of Hours To Get Through Dinner. It's  A Shame As It Could Be So Much Better.,,,,,
,4153,We Ate Breakfast And Lunch In The Restaurants And Room Services. Met Expectations But Not Extraordinary.,,,,,
,4158,On First Night Could Not Get A Table Till 9:30 And No One In Reception Wanted To Help. I Felt That I Had To Beg In The Bistro To Get An Early Table. Quality Of Food In The Bistro Was Poor. Dinner On Second Night In Oakroom Was Good And All Staff There Were Good. We Decided To Have Icecream And Drinks In The Bar With Children. Asked 3 Times To Be Served And Was Never Served. Complained To Reception And Was Told They Would Notify The Manager. Never Had A Response. Afternoon Tea At 5:30 On Wednesday. Kept Waiting For Our Table Which Was Clear And Ready!- Again Poor. Drinks Arrived At 6:05. Champagne And Tea Together. Dined Out From Then On!,,,,,
,4161,Food V Expensive In Main Restaurant Better Value In The Brasserie,,,,,
,4162,The Bistro Was Very Relaxed And Informal And Was Just What We Wanted.  The Staff Were Really Kind And Accommodated Us And Our 18 Month Old With Ease And Flexibility.  We Loved Breakfast And Again The Staff Were Very Considerate.  The Food Was Very Good Quality And Clearly Premium Products Were Used.,,,,,
,4163,The Steak Was Over Done  For That Amount Of Money You Expect Excellent Food,,,,,
,4166,Amazing,,,,,
,4172,Sorry  Please See Response As Entered Under # 6.  Salt & Pepper Should Also Always Be Provided On Tables And Room Service Trays.  Butter Should Always Be Provided With Bread Or Other Carbs.,,,,,
,4173,Food Arrived Very Late And Bill Was Incorrect.  We Were Asked If We Had A Pen To Sign The Bill With.,,,,,
,4175,As I Already Wrote  I Would Transform At Least One Of The Restaurants In The Same Style Than The Bar Room.,,,,,
,4176,The Bistro Menu Is Very Restricted And The Same For Lunch And Dinner. It Is Not In Line With The Standard Of Your Hotel. The Grill Restaurant Menu Was Good On Appearance But Our Dinner Was Actually Very Average. We Had The Steak Hamburger With Brioche And Foie Gras. It Was Really Dry. I Have Had Better Burgers In Road Side Restaurants...,,,,,
,4179,I Prefer More Fish Selection From The Menu.,,,,,
,4185,Wearing Dirty Jeans With Holes In Them And Lumber Jack Shirts!,,,,,
,4186,Hotter Soup! (If I Had To Find 1 Thing That I Wasn't Happy With  And It Wasn't Cold I Just Like My Soup Red Hot),,,,,
,4192,See Comments Below Re: The Bistro,,,,,
,4198,The Food Was Great I Have To Say. The Hotel Was Very Quite So There Was No Real Atmosphere To Speak Of In The Dinning Room But Was Food Was Very Good. The Sommelier (Lady From Spain I Think) Was Very Good Indeed And Was Very Chatty And Actually Made Our Final Dinner Great Fun.  Nit Picking - The Cheese Board Was Fab But A Couple Of The Cheeses Looked A Little Old. Again Minor Detail  But At 3 Rosettes You Need To Look Out For That. I Come From A 3 Star Michelin Background So I Do Tend To Notice The Little Things.. The Olives In The Bar  However Are Very Cheap And Nasty And Do Need Attention. The Black Olives Are Actually Tasteless.  Overall Though I Enjoyed The Experience  The Service Was Excellent  And Would Return In The Summer When It More Busy.,,,,,
,4201,Due To Private Function   Eat In Breakfast Room   Thought It Lacked Atmosphere. Generally Felt Food Lacked The Depth Of Quality You Would Expect For The Venue,,,,,
,4202,Excellent Service  Wonderful Food,,,,,
,4203,Dining In The Brasserie Was Good. Dining In The Main Restaurant Is Sorry....... . To Expensive For That What You Get In Quality  Sorry. Also After 3 Weeks In Devon And Cornwall. The Poorest Expirience - Compaire It With A Carlyon Bay Hotel And Spa - The Food And Service Was Absolutly Great!,,,,,
,4205,Very Disappointing. The Reality Does Not Meet Expectation. We Can Accept A One Off Poor Service In The Edwardian Grill But Even The Breakfast Experience Was Awful On Both Days. Rather Than Take Dinner On The Second Night We Went Into Bovey Tracey. The Bistro However Was Very Good And The Staff Were Excellent. When We Gathered For The Falcon Display With Your Other Residents Outside And Then Found Out  20 Minutes Laterwhen We Went To Investigate That It Wasnt Happening  Everybody Was Complaining About The Poor Food And Service.,,,,,
,4206,Breakfast Were Poor- A Buffet Under Hot Lamps Is Like A Travel Lodge And The Toast Was Not Toasted And No Black Pudding!,,,,,
,4209,Edwardian Grill Was Superb  Bistro A Bit Of A Let Down In Comparison. Service At Dinner Was Excellent  At Breakfast It Was Slow And Looked Very Chaotic!,,,,,
,4210,Excellent Food Great Service Brilliant Day,,,,,
,4212,Very Poor Waiting Staff  In Both Restaurants,,,,,
,4213,The Bistro Is Very Poor And Would Prove Problematic For A Return Visit As I Would Not Want Eat Lunch Or Dinner Here. Also The Menu In The Grill Is Limited If Staying For More Then Two Nights. Also Needs Some Simple Options.,,,,,
,4215,Expensive.  Despite Advising On Numerous Occasions Resort Staff Prior To Our Stay That It Was Our Son's 21St Birthday (8 Feb) No Acknowledgement Was Made.  I Had Asked For A Special Table At The Edwardian Grill But We Were Seated At The Kitchen Entrance.  Had To Pour Our Own Water And Wine On A Number Of Occasions.  Bill Was Wrong.  No-One Escorted Us Out Of The Restaurant At The End Of The Meal (To Check How We Had Enjoyed Ourselves  Etc)  Despite Our Evening Costing £460 For 5 People!,,,,,
,4216,Would Like Hot Plates For Breakfast.,,,,,
,4217,We Had To Return Some Undercooked Scallops  But The Service Was Execellent!,,,,,
,4218,Much Improved Bistro Service From Previous Years. Staff Very Good And Food Quality Better. Had Long Wait Times And Poor Service In First Visit.,,,,,
,4220,Bit Slow Getting Drinks In The Bar But All Round It Was Good,,,,,
,4222,Quality Of Staff And Sommelier At Edwardian Not Corresponding To Image And Price Level.,,,,,
,4225,No,,,,,
,4228,We Had A Delicious Afternoon Tea - Although One Of The Scone Was Placed Upside Down In The Jam - Not Sure Why. When I Mentioned A Nut Allergy The Waitress Immediately Replaced Several Items - A Nut Allergy Warning On The Menu Would Be Helpful As It Bits On Top Of The Eclair And Hazlenut Filling Were Not Obvious. At Other Venues/Hotels We Have Visited You Usually Get Offered A Top Up On Your Drink. The Staff In The Bistro Were Friendly And Helpful. The Staff In The Edwardian Grill Varied. They Were Attentive But Several Of Them Lacked A Smile! We Had A Super Sunday Lunch. Breakfast Was Good But We Had To Ask For Warm Plates To Put Our Hot Food On.,,,,,
,4229,The Dining Was Lovely  The Food Excellent  However Breakfast Was Extremely Disappointing .. Probably The Worst We Have Had. There Were No Orange Or Grapefruit Segments  No Prunes Or No Muesli.  Stocks Were Low And Not Replenished.  We Were Very Disappointed At Not Being Able To Book Our Dinner At 7 Due To The Wedding  Our Table Was For 7.30 However When We Got There On Time We Were Asked To Wait Ten Mins  We Ended Up Waiting Twenty Before We Were Shown Our Table And The Menus. We Received Our First Course At 8.20. Which Was Not Good As We Had Our Son With Us Aged  13.,,,,,
,4230,The Service Was Extremely Slow In The Edwardian Grill  Even Getting A Glass Of Water Took Ages.  The Service In The Bistro Was Great And Our Waitress Was Cheerful And Helpful And Really Helped Create A Good Atmosphere.,,,,,
,4231,Cheese Waiter !!???!!!!,,,,,
,4232,Bistro Was Expensive But Good Quality And Portions. Table Layout Was Cramped. The Grill Was Extremely Expensive For Such Small Portions That We Went Back To The Lodge For More. Wine Was Ridiculously Expensive And The Waiter Was Patronising. Menu Did Not List All Items On Plate And I Disliked My Main Course So Much I Left It. My Dessert Did Not Contain What Was Listed On The Menu. This Experience For My Son's 21 St Put Us Off The Hotel And May Stop Us Returning.,,,,,
,4233,Totally Understaffed In The Bistro.  Limited Menu.  Edwardian Grill  Food Nice  Decor Dated.  Breakfast Extortionate.,,,,,
,4234,The Atmosphere In The Edwardian Grill On A Saturday Night Was Quite - It Is  A Big Room To Have Son Few Diners In. The Menu In The Castle Bistro Was Limited - More Intresting Salads Would Hve Been Nice For The Summer.,,,,,
,4237,Breakfast Was A Bot Of A Shambles.  Staff Did Not Know Who Had Ordered Coffees/Teas And Where Going To The Wrong Guests  The Food Had Been Under The Heat For A Long While And Was Not Freshened Sufficiently Regularly.  Generally The Staff At Breakfast And In The Bistro Where Not Over Friendly.,,,,,
,4238,The Edwardian Grill Seemed To Lack A Little Atmosphere. Not As Nice As Some Other Rooms In The Hotel.,,,,,
,4239,The Service Was Incredibly Slow. No Apologies Were Made.,,,,,
,4241,The Food Was Excellent On Two Occasions And Mediocre On One Other. Room Service Was Bitterly Disappointing  To The Point Of Being Inedible. Repeated Set Menus Are Inevitable  But When It's As Predictable As Mcdonalds  Then It's Unacceptable At Your Tariffs.,,,,,
,4242,Wunderbar!!!  Thnx For Getting Me The Lamb!!!,,,,,
,4243,The Standards Betweeen The Two Restaurants Were Extreme In Both Quality And Service.  The Bistro Was Very Uninspiring And The Service Was Not Great.  The Service In The Oak Bar Was Very Slow.  The Food And Service In The Edwardian Restaurant Was Excellent.  The Cost Of The Food Was High For The Quality Of It In The Bistro And Oak Bar.,,,,,
,4244,Service Very Slow Generally No Bread Brought With Soup At Lunch Unless Asked For (After Over An Hour Wait) This Is Your Achilles Heal,,,,,
,4245,Some Of The Dishes Were Fantastic  Others Not So  So Overall I Have Put Good But The First And Last Night Our Dinner Was Outstanding.,,,,,
,4250,We Felt The Food Was The One Area That Let The Experience Down. We Were Travelling Around England On Our Holiday So Could Compare Several Properties To Bovey Castle. Bovey Provided The Nicest Room Of The Places We Stayed But Would Rate The Food As Not Nearly As Good As Some Of The Other Properties. The Food Was Adequate Only We Felt.,,,,,
,4251,Very Slow Service In The Bistro,,,,,
,4255,The Bistro Was Fantastic  Food And Service Were Top-Notch.  We Enjoyed Breakfast At The Edwardian Grill But Did See Some Service Issues.  We Normally Had The Buffet  But Watched As A Couple At Another Table Ordered Coffee And Toast Several Times.  At One Point  We Felt So Bad That My Wife Asked Out Server To Check On Their Order.  Compared To The Bistro  The Grill Didn't Seem To Have The Same Level Of Service.  But The Food Was Excellent In Both Places.,,,,,
,4256,Service Could Be Rather Slow At Times  Even When The Restaurant Was Not Busy; This Is A Priority For Parents With Small Children As It Is Stressful For The Child  The Parents And Other Near-By Diners When A Small Child Becomes Restless. Having To Abandon One's Meal Or Have It Taken Up To One's Room Spoils The Dining Experience. No Account Is Taken Of The Particular Needs Of Young Children Regarding Provision Of Smaller Scale Cutlery And Crockery: A 14' Diameter Plate With A Boiled Egg In The Centre Puts The Egg Uncomfortably Out Of Reach For A Four-Year-Old And Serving Hot Chocolate In A Tall Glass With A Small  Low Handle Is Impractical And Unsafe.,,,,,
,4257,The Decaf Coffee Served At Breakfast Was So Strong It Was Undrinkable.,,,,,
,4258,We Stayed For 6 Days And Would Have Eaten With You More Often If The Menu Had Changed Or Had Daily Specials Reflecting Local Produce. The Cheese Board Was Fantastic.,,,,,
,4262,The Restaurant Was A Bit Noisy.,,,,,
,4263,We Experienced Several Issues: One Night  It Took Over 1 Hour For Our Food To Arrive In The Edwardian Grill After Ordering One Night You Had A Wedding Party In The Bistro And Had Not Made Us Either Aware Nor Made Alternative Arrangements For Us To Dine.  In The End We Were Offered A Table In The Bistro Amongst The Wedding (Not Appropriate) Or Eating On Our Laps In One Of The Lounges !!! For A Quality Establishment  You Should Not Leave It Up To Your Guests To Insist On Taking A Table In The Edwardian Grill And Ordering From The Bistro Menu.  We Have Stayed In Many Other Good Hotels (E.G. Stoke Park) And This Aspect Of The Stay Has Let Bovey Down Again (The Last Time We Stayed We Experienced Long Delays In The Restaurant).,,,,,
,4266,We Ate In Both Restaurants  The Edwardian Was A Lovely Experience And Excellent All Round....Compliments To All! We Also Ate In The Bistro  We Ordered Fish And Chips Which We Had Eaten On A Previous Visit And Was So Good We Wanted Them Again!  Unfortunately The F&C Were Disgusting We Had To Send Them Back To The Kitchen And Reorder Off The Menu. The Situation Was Handled Well By Staff And The Replacement Meal Very Nice. However This Experience Did  Taint Our Taste Buds And Therefore Affected Our Overall Dining Experience,,,,,
,4267,The Food Is Good But Expensive,,,,,
,4268,The Bistro Looks Like A Motorway Service Area - Surely Worth A Redecoration.,,,,,
,4270,The Cooked Breakfast Was Very Poor  Including The Cooked And Buffet Food. The Service Was Very Slow Also  Had To Ask For Toast And Coffee 3 Times First Morning.,,,,,
,4272,The Bistro Is Getting Better But Still Lack The Leadership That Would Make It A Truly Excellent Experience  And Again The Food Was Excellent Throughout,,,,,
,4273,We Had Expected The Atmosphere To Be More Like In The Hotel. The Variety Of Food Was Not Very Large  The Taste Was Not What We Had Hoped For. Service Was Friendly But A Little Slow.,,,,,
,4274,Breakfast Was A Shamles And Took An Hour And A Quarter - Ridiculous. Dinner Was Good.,,,,,
,4275,A Disappointing Menu And No Wine List  Little Atmosphere. Too Many Small Children Who Were Poorly Behaved After 8.30 In The Evening. Tomato Soup Awful  Was It Really Home Made As It Tasted As If It Was Out Of A Packet.,,,,,
,4276,Its Very Very Good And A Pleasure.... As Ever,,,,,
,4279,My Only Disappointment With The Dining Experience Was Worrying That We Would Have To Pay For Some Of The Meal As Our Prize Said We Could Have A 3 Course Meal But We Were Told We Could Have Up To The Value Of £90-This Was Only After I Queried Having To Sign For The Bill  Being Charged For Water Etc.Next Morning.So Instead Of Having A Nice Relaxing Evening  I Was Worrying About Charges I Didn't Expect To Have To Pay.Quite Frankly It Was Quite Hard To Get A 3 Course Meal For 2 For Under £90.Someone Would Have Had To Have Had The Soup And/Or An Icecream.Making It Up To £100 Would Have Helped.My Gallant Husband Went Without Pudding So That I Could Have What I Wanted Without Being Over The £90 Limit.Thus He Did Not Get A 3 Course Meal.,,,,,
,4280,An Excellent Meal With Good Service.,,,,,
,4282,Dining Room Is A Little Tired - The Dividers Are A Good Idea But Ugly. Excellent Staff  Katrina  Wine Waiter Excellent.  Milk Supplied For Coffee Was Very Strange - We Sent It Back Twice - Seemed Either To Be Long Life / Uht ? Breakfast Buffet - Why Was There No Muesli Available At All  Some Odd Granola  But Surely A Fresh Muesli Should Be Available,,,,,
,4283,A Bit Pricey  Particularly The Lower End Of The Wine List. However  The Quality Outweighed This.,,,,,
,4285,The Pre Dinner Drinks Bar Service Several Lacking In Service  No One Comes Round To Ask If You Would Like Another Drink  We Stayed Here 2 Nights And I Wondered If They Ever Did Have A Manager! No One Seems To Oversee The Whole Operation   No Attention To Detail,,,,,
,4286,We Loved It!,,,,,
,4289,No Atmosphere In The Large Dining Room Which Was Empty. Staff Could Be More Observant Of Own Personal Hygiene. Flicking My Cheese To Explain What It Was...Unbelievable; Wine For Cheese Also Arrived After Cheese Course Was Finished. What Happened To The 52 Cheese Trolley To Choose From  We Had 5 Small Pieces Plonked On A Plate...No Choice At All!!!!,,,,,
,4290,Service In Bar Very Slow On One Occassion Ignored For 10 Minutes,,,,,
,4292,When Making My Room Reservation I Also Made A Point Of Booking A Dinner Reservation For 2 At 8.15 Pm On 14 September. When Turning Up For Dinner We Were Told By The Waiter That Our Reservation Did Not Exist. We Ended Up Having To Wait For Over An Hour For A Table Which Completely Spoilt The Mood Of The Evening On What Was Supposed To Be A Personal Celebration For Myself And My Wife.,,,,,
,4297,The Private Dining Experience Was Very Good However The Sunday Lunch Service Was Very Slow!,,,,,
,4301,Overall Food And Service Were Excellent. The Maitre D' Was Very Approachable  Professional And Well Informed Lady And She Was Able To Help Us With Wine Choices And Was Very Welcoming And Generous In Resolving Matters When They Went A Little Awry. I Think The Wine List Would Benefit From A Greater Range Of Wines As I Think That Some Of The People That Haven't Flown Down In A Helicoper With A Big Bank Bonus Think That Under £100 For A Bottle Of Wine With Dinner Is A Good Place To Be In Terms Of Price!,,,,,
,4302,Service And Quality At The Edwardian Grill Should Be Urgently Improved,,,,,
,4303,Good Service In Bistro  But Disappointing Service In Restaurant  Friendly But Incompentent And Uncoordinated  We Had To Remain Personal Twice To Three Times To Get What We Have Ordered. Cost-Benefit Ratio In The Restaurant Is Not Well Balanced  E.G. The Steak Was Ordered Medium And Delivered Well Done.,,,,,
,4304,Breakfast Was Poor. Scrambled Eggs Sloppy  Sausages Cold  Breakfast Buffet Does Not Reflect Promised Quality Of Edwardian Restaurant.,,,,,
,4305,Service For Dinner Was Good. Service In The Bistro Could Have Been Better. Breakfast On Our Last Morning Was Appalling. Service In The Bar Was Poor.,,,,,
,4306,Having Arrived Later In The Day We Were Not Hungry Enough To Go To Your Main Restaurant But Found That The Menu In The Bistro Too Basic. Burgers Or Pizza!! My Partner Had Fish And Chips Which Was Very Disappointing  Still Not Too Sure What Fish This Was.,,,,,
,4307,On The Monday When The Hotel Was Quiet Wasa Rung In The Morning To Ask For Food In The Evening. The Room Service Guy Checked With The Chef But Confirmed That We Could Not Get Food On The Same Day. It Needed To Be Ordered The Night Before. Also The Castle Bistro Closed At 6 On Monday And Tuesday. This Seems Incredible For A 5 Star Hotel. I Thought As Custoemrs We Could Have Bene Looked After Better Than That Particulalry When The Hotel Is So Quiet. The Food Is Expensive.,,,,,
,4308,Overall It Was Very Good. The Only Small Detail I Noticed (That Did Not Affect My Enjoyment) Was That The Staff Needed To Improve Their Attire. Most Of The Suits Worn Were Either Mismatched Or A Bit Threadbare. Perhaps A Clothing Allowance Would Help?,,,,,
,4309,Restaurant Manager Was Extremely Efficient.,,,,,
,4310,Service Was Slower Than Desirable. Both Nights Menu Options Were Curtailed. No Draft Beer On Second Night. Cocktail Poor No Stones Ginger For Whiskey Mac. Afternoon Tea Resulted In Limited Places To Sit On Sunday For Guests. Fire Was Smoking Badly. Staff Very Pleasant But Variable Efficiency And Slow To Attend Reception Very Good.,,,,,
,4311,The Overall Service In The Edwardian Grill Has Improved  Aswell As The Quality Of Food. As Resort Members  We Have Experienced Problems In The Castle Bistrothrough The Year  But I Am Pleased That The Food & Service Have Been Improved Reecently. Hopefully This Will Continue Through The Quieter Winter Months.,,,,,
,4312,Breakfast Facilities Excellent Evening Dining Not So Good,,,,,
,4314,I Have 1 Negative Comment Regarding Breakfast. After Ordering We Had To Wait Some Time For Our Beverages  Then We Had Eaten All The Toast Before The Cooked Meal Arrived  Which Also Took Along Time!,,,,,
,4316,I Preferred The Bistro.  I Thought The Main Courses Of The Edwardian Grill Were Slightly Prohibitive.  I Had A Risotto When I Dined In There And It Was Disappointing.  The Service And Staff Were Great However As Was The Wine We Selected.,,,,,
,4319,Very Nice Experience In Both Outlets  Quality Food  Wine And Service.,,,,,
,4323,Bistro Menu Lunch And Dinner Is The Same - Boring And Unhealthy. Everything Battered Or With Cheese. How Many Different Salads Can You Offer With Feta Cheese - Aren't They All Really The Same??  Food Inconsistent - Pizza Was Different Each Time Ordered.  Service Slow.  Table To Be Cleared Even Slower. My Hotel Check Out Bill Included The Full Restaurant Charge  Of Course  Which I Believe Also Included The Tip.  I Think The Hotel Then Added Another Restaurant Service Charge On Top.,,,,,
,4324,Breakfast Was A Bit Of A Shambles With More Than One Table Complaining About Lack Of Communication And Poor Service.  Haddock Was Overcooked And Dry As Were The Poached Eggs.  Had Previously Ordered A Greek Salad And Was Served A Goats Cheese Salad - This Was Efficiently Changed But The Salad I Received For £11.50 Was Neither A Greek Nor A Nicoise Salad.  My Husband Had Very Soggy Fries With His Fish And Chips.  We Subsequently Decided Not To Eat In The Edwardian Grill Based On Our Previous Meals.  This Was Disappointing As We Had A Party Of 10 Family Members Joining Us And We Ended Up A Pub Just Outside Bovey!,,,,,
,4325,We Waited An Hour For Our Meal After The Order,,,,,
,4327,On Our First Night We Eat At The Edwardian Grill Which Was The Better Of The Two Evenings. In General The Food In The Edwardian Grill Was Good And We Enjoyed It  The Service Was Ok  But Not What I Would Have Expected  The Staff Although Friendly Did Continue To Forget Things  We Asked For 2 Glasses Of Wine  We Had To Remind Them. They Asked If We Wanted Some Bread  We Said Yes & They Forgot To Bring It  We Asked For A Bottle Of Sparkling Water  It Didn't Arrive And Gain We Had To Remind Them  They Were Only Small Things Like This  But It Did Give The Impression Of Some Disorganisation.  On The Second Evening We Eat In The Bistro & This Was Just Like A Scene From Fawlty Towers. A Potential Lack Of Staff Meant That Everyone Was Waiting Longer Than Necessary  Our Order For Our Main Course Was Lost & Meant We Had To Wait Longer Than We Wanted  Fortunately For Us We Were Not The Most Discontent People In The Bistro That Evening  With Other Waiting Far Longer Than We Did.,,,,,
,4328,The Bistro Decore Felt Out Of Place Somehow  I Like Modren Design But This One Does Not Fit With The Rest Of The Building  In Particular The Colour Scheme And The Plastic Blue/Balck Flowers Just Looked Bit Less Grand Then The Rest Of The Dining Areas Etc,,,,,
,4329,The Bistro Let Down The Weekend.  We Had To Ask For The Desert Menu  Then Were Asked Our Order Before Seeing The Menu.  We Had A 7 Pm Booking Yet One Of The 3 Choices For Desert Had Run Out!.  We Went To Breakfast At 8 Am Which Unfortunately Was In The Bistro Not The Edwardian Grill  The Food Was Cold  I Pointed This Out To Staff Who Apologised But Took No Action.  On The Sunday Lunchtime The Chef Could Be Heard Arguing With His Staff.  Generally The Bistro Set Low Standards And Failed To Achieve Them.,,,,,
,4334,Poor Choice On The Menu  Lacked Atmosphere.,,,,,
,4338,The Bistro Was Very Busy One Night However The Waiter Still Remained Very Friendly And Helpful. My Partner Is Vegetarian And There Were Some Good Choices For Him.  A Steak Option For Me Would Have Been Nice But All Food Was Very Tasty And Service Good. This Was Value For Money Without Compromise.,,,,,
,4341,We Were Looking Forward To Dining  In The Main Restaurant  But On Looking At The Menu Thought It Very Restricted.  A Wide Choice Of Steaks  But In Our Experience Overpriced.,,,,,
,4342,Loved Being Outside With Lovely View Of Hotel Grounds And Surroundings  But Very Disappointed With Poor Service On One Out Of Two Dinners - Very  Very Slow And I Had Requested A Specific Table In The Morning For Dinner  But The Table Had Not Been Reserved For Me.,,,,,
,4344,The Quality Of The Food Needs To Improve As Well As The Waiting Time At Breakfast.  We Also Heard Swearing Coming From The Kitchen (F Word) On Monday Morning Whilst Waiting For Our Breakfast In The Edwardian Grill.  The Staff In The Bistro Were Pleasant.,,,,,
,4345,Change The Menu More Often,,,,,
,4347,Unfortunately We Felt There Were Much Better Alternatives To The Bistro Available Locally - Better Ambience  Service And Quality/Selection Of Food.,,,,,
,4348,The Waiting Staff Were Particularly Attentive This Year And One Waitress (I Think Her Name Was Becca) Made Us Feel Very Welcome And Should Be Praised For Her Customer Service And Friendliness.,,,,,
,4350,Change The Bistro Menu So We Could Have Eaten There More...,,,,,
,4351,Everything Was Better Than Fine  The Food Was Great The Service Also.,,,,,
,4352,The Price Of The Menu Is Not Reflected In The Quality Of The Meal. Also We Found That The Edwardian Grill Lacked In Atmosphere.,,,,,
,4353,We Ordered Chateau Briand  The Meat Was Lovely (But Only Lovely - Not Amazing As When I Have Had It At Other Restaurants) And The Main Vegetables Were Good  But The Spinach Was Watery And Overcooked And Tasted Horrible All Peppery  The Fondant Potato Was Dry And Yellow  Not At All How It Was Supposed To Be.  We Mentioned It To The Lady Waitress.  The Starters (Scallops And Tartar Were However Lovely).  We Then Had Coffee And Petit Fours In The Cathedral Room And They Had To Be Sent Back As They Were Cold (Even Though The Waiter Had Difficulty Finding Us  As Adam Room Was Busy  They Should Have Been Alot Hotter Than They Were.  Perhaps Serve In A Pot Or Cafetieres.  The Edwardian Grill Room Lacks Some Style  The Grey Gauze Room Dividers Are Ugly  A Pretty Wooden Screen Would Be Better  Or Some Pretty Voile Drapes.  The Waiters Table By The Kitchen Looks Really Scruffy And Unprofessional  Traditional Wooden Serving Units Would Look Better  Tucked To One Side.  A Child Playing A Dvd/Game Console At The Table Should Not Have Been Allowed  Or At Least Asked To Turn The Volume Down.  ,,,,,
,4354,We Both Found The Food Good But Not Excellent.  At £34 For A Main Course - I Would Have Expected Something Really Special. It Doesn't Feel Like Good Value For The Money.  I Wouldn't Come Just For A Meal At Those Prices.,,,,,
,4356,Outstanding Quality And A Pleasant Atmosphere Though Rather Quiet On The Evening We Stayed With Just A Handful Of Other Guests. On The Second Night Of Our Stay We Could Not Eat At The Time We Preferred Due To Conference Visitors And So Ate Out In One Of The Local Villages. Such Turned Out To Be An Enjoyable Evening,,,,,
,4357,Dinner Was Excellent But Breakfast Was A Shambles. We Had To Wait For A Table To Be Set  We Were Not Given A Menu  Just Directed To The Buffet And We Had To Request Coffee And Then Toast And Then Butter And Jams.,,,,,
,4358,Wine And Drinks Very Expensive.  E.G. Glass Of Champagne At 14.00.  9.00 To 10.00 Typical At Other Hotels.  No Range Of Cheaper But Good Quality House Wines.,,,,,
,4364,Dissapointed That The Castle Was Full Of 'Groupon Deal-Seekers' And As One Of The Few Paying Full Price We Had To Wait Until 9.45Pm To Eat As We Didnt Want To Eat In The Burger Bar Bistro.This Affected My Sleep,,,,,
,4377,The Staff Including Manager With The Quality Of Food Makes Your Stay So Enjoyed Experience   Maybe Bistro Have Larger Choice On Menu,,,,,
,4378,Breakfast Was Not At The Same Standard As The Wedding Breakfast Or Bistro Meal.,,,,,
,4380,I Appreciate You Were Catering To A Large Number Of Guests But I Thought The Bacon And The Sausages At Breakfast Were Not Very Well Cooked Or Presented.,,,,,
,4382,We Had A Private Bbq And I Was Not Happy With The Quality Or Quantity Of Food Available. Both My Husband And I Felt Slightly Unwell After Eating The Burgers Provided.  There Was Only Enough Food For People To Have One Choice Of Meat And There Was No Choice Of Dessert.  I Did Not Like The Dessert As It Contained Cream Which I Do Not Like.,,,,,
,4383,We Hired The Summer House For Dinner And Were Able To Have Our Two Labradors With Us.  It Was A Magical Evening.,,,,,
,4385,I Could Not Possibly Recommend That My Local Friends Have A Night Out At Bove For Dining.,,,,,
,4386,Firstly Breakfast Was Rather Disappointing - Continental Had Very Little Choice And The Tiny Piece Of Haddock Presented To Me Was Rather Insulting For The Additional £ 15. You Also Charged My 2 .5 Year Old Son For Sharing Half Of My Croissant But I Couldn't Be Bothered To Argue. Lastly At Midday I Was Told By Your Staff In Your Castle Bistro That I Could Arrange A Barbecue At The Lodge That Evening - I Mentioned To Your Cleaner At 1.00Pm That I'd Like To Do This At Which Point He Said He Would Inform The 'Supervisor' - At 5.00Pm I Called Reception To Arrange This To Be Told It Should Have Been Booked By 10.00Am - Eventually They Managed To Sort Out The Huge Issue Of Connecting A Gas Bottle For Me But It Was Apparent This Simple Request Was All Too Much - Who Knows At 10.00Am If They Are Planning To Have A Barbecue That Night ?,,,,,
,4393,Fantastic - Shame It's So Far From London!,,,,,
,4396,I Went To The Bar  Had A Drink And Was Asked If I Was Dining  Said Yes. Was Then Totally Ignored While Otherpeople Arrived And Were Served First And Given Menus. A Couple Of Staff In Suits Arrived And Strated Giving Glasses Of Champagne Out To Guests  Again Ignored. Asked For A Menu And Was Ignored. Stayed 45 Minutes And Went To Restaurant Door Ay 7.15  Again Ignored. Ordered Room Service. Food Was Good But Cold,,,,,
,4399,The Atmosphere At The Bistro Was Not What We Expected Comparing To The Superb Atmosphere In The Rest Of Your House But Food Etc. Was Excellent,,,,,
,4400,Slow Service And Staff Did Not Really Know What They Were  Doing At Breakfast Having To Remind Them For Tea Or Toast Or An Order You Had Put In 20 Minutes Ago Bistro Service Was Good,,,,,
,4403,Slight Confusion Over The Drinks  Which Had To Be Re-Ordered As The Original Order Was Lost.  Resulted In Us Eating Half The Meal With No Wine.,,,,,
,4404,We Loved The Afternoon Tea. Unfortunately  There Was No Reservation Made For House Guests So We Ended Up Without Table And Had To Wait. I Would Recommend To Always Make Reservations For House Guests So They Can Arrive And Have Tea Effortlessly As - Like Us They  Might Not Even Know There Is Such A Lovely Afternoon Tea Possibility.,,,,,
,4405,Certain The Food In The Edwardian Grill Is Perfect  But The Atmosphere Doesn't Appeal  Too Formal.,,,,,
,4411,More Salads And Veggies....,,,,,
,4415,Staff Very Attentive. Bistro Food Prices Are Reasonable. The Edwardian Restaurant Although The Fine Dining Option We Felt It Is Perhaps A Bit Over Priced For The Quality Of The Food In Comparison With The Bistro,,,,,
,4417,Bistro Was Disappointing Missed Placed Booking A Bit Embarassing  Very Poor Service To Many Faults,,,,,
,4419,The Castle Bistro Was Great For Lunch. Our Dinner In The Edwardian Grill Was Very Disappointing. We Certainly Did Not Experience The 'Immaculate Service' Mentioned On The Hotel Website!,,,,,
,4420,Would Not Use Again Until There Is Consistency With Both Food And Service. It Seems The Hotel Is Only Able To Focus On One Or The Other,,,,,
,4422,Bistro Menu Limited  Especially Desserts. Had A Lemon Ice Cream Which Was Amazing! Fish Cakes Plumped Up With Tasteless Potato Concoction  Not The Best I Have Tasted. Edwardian Grill Faultless - Best Steak Dinner Ever!,,,,,
,4424,Breakfast Was Awful - Not 5 Star Standard. (Put Me Off Trying To Extend My Stay) Afternoon Tea Was V Nice But Really Needs Tea Refills V Limited Menu At Bistro - Extremely Poor Service,,,,,
,4426,The Portions Seemed Larger In The Bistro Than In The Edwardian Restaurant.  However Overall They Were Both Delightful.,,,,,
,4427,Service Slow And Pressured In The Bistro - Not Enough Staff - One Efficient And Friendly (Lady)  One Cold And Avoiding Helping (Man),,,,,
,4429,The Edwardian Grill Menu Was Pretensious Rather Than High Quality. The Flavour And Presnetaiton Of The Food Did Not Necessarily Match The Promise On The Menu And So This Was Relatively Dissappointing So We Ate There Only Once. On The Other Hand The Catsle Bistro Menu Was Limited But The Quality Of The Food Served There Was Excellent And The Staff  Although Very Busy (Half Term Week) Were Very Attentive And Friendly So This Was A Far More Enjoyable Experience. We Therefore Ate There On More Than One Evening.,,,,,
,4430,Service Was Great  Food Needs Work  Not All That Memorable,,,,,
,4435,Edwardian Grill Was Great But We Found The Bistro Very Disappointing Uninspired Choices And Not Well Executed.   The Grill Was Lovely But Expensive And Not Necessarily The Sort Of Food You Want Every Day.  The Bistro Was Considerably Less Good Than Our Local Pub!  If Marking The Grill Separately I Would Mark It Poor.,,,,,
,4436,Quality Of Food Excellent With New Chef Miles Better Than Before. 1 Fish  1 Meat  1Poultry  1 Venison Etc. Offers To My Liking Not Enough Choice For An A La Carte Menu. I Would Also Appreciate More Local Produce  Especially  Fish. The Service Is Very Friendly At All Times  But That Doesn't Compensate For The Rather Un Co-Ordinated Impression It Gave. I Would Prefer To Get Served By The Same Set Of Servants Per Evening.  Otherwise The Waiting Time After The Order Was Generally Too Long. In The Castle Bistro It Takes Far Too Long To Be Attended To - Seems Understaffed - The Food Offered Is Not What I Would Generally Look For In A Hotel Like Yours. A Top Quality Modern English Kitchen  Based On Local Produce Would Be My Favorite  Served In A Relaxed Casual Atmosphere. The Edwardian Grill Should Be Reserved For More Formal Dining Also In Regard To The Attire. I Am Not Talking About Black Tie Here  But Guests In Trainers And T-Shirts And Children Bare Feet In Their Night Dress  I Find Rather Unsuited.  ,,,,,
,4440,We Definitely Made A Big Mistake In Eating In The Castle Bistro; We Should Have Dined In The Edwardian Grill. The Lamb  Recommended By The Hotel Manager Was Tough  Sinewy And Tasteless And We Had To Wait For Nearly An Hour For Our Food. I Have Waited For A Week To Fill Out This Survey As The Hotel Manager Said He Would Try To Find Out From The Chefs And The Kitchen Why We Had This Experience And Then He Would Email To Explain. I Am Not The Type Of Person  However  To Write This On A Public Forum  Such As Tripadvisor  I Would Rather Give You This Feedback Directly.,,,,,
,4441,Was Disappointed That Alcohol Could Not Be Included In Our '£30 Allowance'  I Think Travel Zoo Deal Would Have Been Better If  The Meal Was Included No Matter The Price (Maybe For Bistro Bar Only) And It Was Clear The Alcohol Was Extra. Not Too Happy With Paying A 'Service Charge' In Addition.,,,,,
,4442,The Breakfast In The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent So Much Choice And Excellent Staff,,,,,
,4443,Our Chicken Was Not Cooked  Not What You Expect In A 5* Castle. We Did Tell The Staff And They Were Excellent But All The Food Was Not What We Expected. Eg. Hot Salmon For Starter Was Cold Very Nice But Cold......,,,,,
,4444,Had The Greek Salad Not Much Feta Did Not Taste The Balsamic Nor Honey,,,,,
,4445,Edwardian Grill Experience Very Good Completely Different To The Castle Bistro.,,,,,
,4446,We Had Take Away In The Lodge Which Was Half Hour Later Than Requested And Was Missing A Meal. However The Roast Delivered Was Wonderful,,,,,
,4447,We Felt That The Castle Bistro Let The Hotel Down Somewhat. Service Was A Little Offhand. Wine Was Outrageously Priced For A 'Cheaper' Venue. We Weren't Convinced That Our Fresh Pasta Was Indeed Fresh  As It Was Stuck Together. Pizza Was Tasteless - No Herbs  Olives  Capers? On A Cool July Evening  The Room Was Unpleasantly Warm. We Didn't Really Feel That Anyone Was Paying Attention To Guests' Comfort So Weren't Prepared To Pay The Higher Prices In The Grill Room In Case The Same Was True There.,,,,,
,4449,The Service And Food Was Fine For A Bistro So No Problem.  However  We Had Dreadful Service For Breakfast.  Waited Ages For Our Tea And Coffee - Had To Ask Twice Yet The Room Was Swarming With Staff.    We Felt Ignored.,,,,,
,4452,The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent In All Respects,,,,,
,4453,We Dined In The Castle Bistro Twice  The First Time Service Was Good Ang The Food Was Fair  On The Second Evening (Thurs 29Th Aug) The Service And Food Were Both Very Poor  We Had A Very Long Wait For Our Meals And When They Arrived One Was Very Poor/ Inedible.,,,,,
,4454,Flowers On Table Were Tired.,,,,,
,4456,Would Appreciate Having Gluten-Free Alternatives (Celiac-Disease),,,,,
,4458,Very Modern Compared With Rest Of Hotel,,,,,
,4463,Very Good Service,,,,,
,4465,I Was With My 14Yr Son So We Ate In The Bistro. The Food Was Terrible. It Was As If It All Came From Frozen Packets And Heated In The Microwave. The Service Was Also Slow As There Did Not Seem To Be Enough Staff. This Part Of Our Experience Really Soured The Overall Weekend And Really Let The Hotel Down. It Should Be Easy To Get This Right.,,,,,
,4467,Very Poor Meal In The Castle Bisto. Restaurant Cold And Empty. Very Bland Pizzas For The Children And Tasteless Bolognese Sause On The Pasta. Think The Chef Was On A Post New Year Holiday. Very Nice Lounge Meals In The Oak Room And Library The Follow Day.,,,,,
,4469,I Was Rudely Spoken To Publicly By The Elder Staff Member From The Golf Shop In The Bistro - Previously Mentioned. The Chef Was Having A Row With His Sous Chef - Very Publicly.,,,,,
,4470,Service Was Rather Amateurish For A Hotel And Restaurant Of Its Standing.,,,,,
,4474,We Ate In One Of The Reception Rooms By The Fire. It Was Lovely To Be Able To Do This.,,,,,
,4475,Limited Menu.  Pizza Had No Flavour.,,,,,
,4477,Staff Get Know The Number Of The Table........Fillet Steak At This Level Should Be High Quality ............Mine Was Def Not,,,,,
,4478,Food Was Excellent  One Or Two Staff Were Also Of A High Standard However The Head Waiter Lacked Considerable Tact And Reduced The Overall Quality Of Service Rating To 'Fair',,,,,
,4480,The Ambiance In The Edwardian Was Great  Loved The Candelabras  Made It Very Romantic,,,,,
,4481,Dining Room Bery Nice  Staff Attentive And Nothing Too Much Trouble...Food Excellent,,,,,
,4482,As We Were A Large Party On The Whole You Managed Us Well  But Breakfast 'Got Lost' On Saturday Morning And One Or Two Problems Both Evenings Regarding What Was Ordered Needed Sorting Out,,,,,
,4483,With Exception Of Cheese Selection Which Was Wonderful Found The Other Courses Very Average And Portions Too Small,,,,,
,4484,On Our First Night  The Meat Was So Overlooked  It Couldn't Even Be Cut And Every Single Meal We Had Over The Weekend Was Cold!,,,,,
,4487,I'm Afraid The Dining Experience Did Not Live Up To The Cost.  Breakfast Was Poor.,,,,,
,4488,The Food Was Very Good  But I Had A Rib Eye Steak Which Was Cooked As I Asked  But Very Dry.,,,,,
,4490,I Didn't Feel That Our Dining Experience Lived Up To Our Previous Visit. We Were Expecting Perfection Because This Was Experienced Last Time But It Didn't Quite Make The Grade. Still Very Good Relative To Other Venues But Not As Good As Usual. It Was My Son's Sixteen Th Birthday But This Clearly Hadn't Been Communicated. The Service Wasn't As Personal As Usual And We Had To Ask For The Wine To Be Topped Up. The Pasta Starter Wasn't Great And The Whole Menu Was A La Carte No Table D'hote Option As We Hd Experienced Previously.,,,,,
,4491,Superb.,,,,,
,4492,The Service Was Fabulous And The Food Was To Die For  We Have Never Visited A Hotel Like This Before And Really Enjoyed The Experience.,,,,,
,4493,Cold Coffee  Burnt Pancakes And A Poorly Presented Chateaubriand Was Not Good Value For Money The Cream Tea Was Lacking As Was The Afternoon Tea. We Had To Wait 15 Mins For Our Cold Coffee To Be Replaced. Only To Be Told They Forgot. Not What You Expect From A 5 Star Resort. The Pancakes Were Very Poor. To Serve Them Burnt Was Bad Enough With A Mere Hint Of Maple Syrup.In Most Other Places One Would Have A Small Jug. It Was Very Unfair And We Were All Diappointed And Would Nt Be Able To Recommend To Our Friends To Eat At Bovey Castle,,,,,
,4495,As The Wine Appears Separately On The Bill I Think That The 121/2% Service Charge Is A Bit Steep Especially As It Is More If You Have A More Expensive Bottle Of Wine Whereas The Service Is Presumably Exactly The Same.,,,,,
,4498,The Service At Breakfast Was Painfully Slow  Despite The Restaurant Being Almost Empty.  We Waited 15 Minutes For Our Tea And Coffee  And A Further Half An Hour For A Full English And Egg Benedict,,,,,
,4499,The Staff Were Amazing -The Chef Came Out To Speak To Us About The Carrot Cake And He Was So Passionate About What He Does. All The Staff Seem To Enjoy Working At Bovey And This Is The Key To Its Special Atmosphere,,,,,
,4503,The Course We Ordered Was Not As Described On The Menu  And When We Questioned This  Our Feedback Was Handled Poorly  With No Kind Of Gesture To Make Us Feel Better About It (Although To Be Fair The Food Was Reasonably Prepared And Reeasonably Tasty).  Also A 'Discretionary' 12% Service Charge Is Unreasonable In A Supposedly 5 Star Hotel.,,,,,
,4505,Dining Area Had No Atmosphere.Staff Friendly But Not Trained.No Descriptions Of Dishes.One Member Of Staff Playing With Wall Speaker.Food Average To Be Honest And Only Warm.Felt We Were Hurried Through The Meal.Whole Experience Was Disappointing .,,,,,
,4507,As Mentioned Before We Did Not Pay Service Charges But Gratuities Were Given To Individuals Giving Good Service.We Appreciated The Receptionist Refunding One Breakfast.,,,,,
,4508,Whilst The Dining Room Staff Were Well Dressed  Presented And Efficient. There Was Very Little Interest/Interaction Between Them And Us Regarding The Choice/Recommendation Of Food And Wine/Champagne. There Can Be No Better Example Of This Than When We Stayed And Dined At Reads In Faversham.,,,,,
,4510,The Chosen Wine As Recommended By The Sommelier Was Not Available. The Replacement Offered Was Not Upto Scratch And The Time Taken Meant That It Was Too Late To Bother With Wine. The Sommelier However Decided To Bring A Glass Of Wine Anyway And That Was Corked So Wasn't Worth Drinking.  The Service Overall Was Very Slow And The Food Was Poor - Pretentious  Breakfast Wasn't Much Better.  The Staff Were Pleasant.  We Had A Long Conversation With The Duty Manager During Breakfast.,,,,,
,4511,My Opinion Some Restraunt Staff Need To Be More Helpfull And A Bit More Cheerful Plus Little Back Ground Music As You Can Hear Pin Drop Which Makes You Feel Like You Need To Whisper In Case You Either Up Set Table Next To You Or You Feel They Are Listening,,,,,
,4512,Cooked Breakfast Was Disgraceful  Obviously Precooked Along Time Before Serving  Even The Mushroom Was Hard To Cut  Complained  But Nothing Happend So Ate Continental Next 2 Days.  2Nd Evening Meal Was The Worse Steak I Have Ever Eaten  All I Could Taste Was Charcoal + No Sauce Offered. I Did Not Complain As This Break Was A Treat For My Wife And Did Not Wis Her To Be Upset  So Third Evening Ate In The Bistro  Great Stake I Was Told That This Was Cooked Differently To The Grill  ,,,,,
,4518,Just Lacked Atmosphere  To Many Foreign Workres And Many Staff Young With Limited Experience.,,,,,
,4521,As Discuss At The Time Of The Stay We Recieved Very Poor Service In The Restaurant  Service In The Bistro Was Good,,,,,
,4522,We Were Dissappointed With Few Things:  -Table Was Not Ready At Our Arrival Even If Booked In Advance: -Meal Order Taken Then Were Told Lamb Was Not Longer Available (Not A Big Deal But Server Should Have Been Told By Chef B4 Order Taken; -Main Course As It Was Served Luke Warm (Nothing Worst!). We Had A Steak And Pork And Had To Be Sent Back. Although Very Pleasant And Really Nice The Manager Was Trying To Tell My Partner That A Medium Rare Steak Would Not Be Hot (Felt Patronizing As We Know It Can Sizzling Hot Outside  Nice And Warm Inside Even If Medium Rare) Which We Disagreed. My Pork Was Also Not Hot Enough. No Steak Knife Was Offered To Start With And Needed To Ask For One. We Had To Have A Fork Changed As Dirty (Again It Happens) And When New One Brought A Long Hair Was Attached To It (Again It Happens But The Whole Experience Ruined The Expected Dining Experience). The Staff In The Restaurant Very Pleasent And The Service Was Very Good; The Feed Back On Food And Experience Was Not Handled That Great On The Night.    ,,,,,
,4524,Our Experience May Have Been Jaded By The Disappointment With Our Room But  We Didn't Find The Food To Be As Good As We Thought During Our Previous Visits,,,,,
,4528,Put A Nz Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc On The Edwardian Grill Wine List  It's On The Bistro List.,,,,,
,4530,It Is Much More Appealing In Its Decor Since The Last Time We Stayed.,,,,,
,4531,Had To Ask Twice For A Wine Refill (After One Person At The Table Had Already Been Missed When The Waiter Came Round).  Similarly When  At The End Of The Meal   Tea Was Requested In Place Of Cofee  A Second Request Was Necessary As Only One Of The Three People Requesting Tea Had This Delivered At First Request.,,,,,
,4532,We Ate In The Edwardian Grill. We Had To Wait 45 Mins From Taking Our Order Until Our Starters Arrived. By That Time Although The Restaurant Wasnt Busy. The Waitress Apologised For The 'Miscommunication In The Kitchen' And Said It Was Her Fault  But To Be Honest It Spoilt The Whole Meal. The Potions Sizes Were Very Small Given The Price And My Fish Was Tastless. It Was A Meant To Be A Special Occassion As It Was My Wifes Birthday But Ended Up In Dissapointment. Regarding The Dress Code  We Saw On Two Occasions Customers Coming In Wearing Jeans Which Was Unnaceptable.  ,,,,,
,4535,I Ate All My Meals In The Library  As I Had My Dog With Me. You Were Very Accommodating. Thank You.,,,,,
,4539,It Was As Expected  Very High Quality Ingredients  With The Exception Of The Sausages That You Cooked For Breakfast.  Again A Small Detail  But Budget Sausages Are Not Great. Why Not Charge More Money Anddont Let Yourself Down On Cheapening The Experience.,,,,,
,4544,We Dined In The Bistro And Found The Menu To Be Extremely Limited. I Had Orginally Booked The Edwardian Grill But Telephoned The Night Before Our Stay And Was Assured That The Bistro Had A Specials Board.  Based On This Information I Changed My Booking To The Bistro Only To Find That There Was No Specials Board.  To My Surprise  There Wasn't Even A Dessert Menu And Only Two Desserts Were Actually On Offer.  The Member Of Staff Was Less Than Helpful When Asked About This.  The 'Bistro' Gave The Perception As Little More Than A Glorified Mcdonalds And Not In Keeping With The General Ambience Of The Rest Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,4548,A Few Things Went Wrong  We Asked For The Meat To Be Cooked Medium Well  As Kate Is Expecting  It Was Quite Rare,,,,,
,4549,Though The Food Was Very Good I Should Like To Point Out Some Issues. After Ordering We Were Informed That One Of The Main Courses Had Sold Out. We Therefore Had To Choose Again. I'd Have Thought That The Foh Should Have Known What Was Available At The Time Of Taking Our Order Considering There Were So Few Diners. Upon Being Seated At Our Table I Noticed The Wine At The Table Was Not The Wine We Had Ordered. I Was Informed That This Was A Substitution As The Wine We Ordered Was Unavailable. I Then Had To Hastily Choose An Alternative Which I Was Disappointed To Later See Had Not Been Discounted Due To Your Error. I Also Felt That Charging For Service In A Hotel Restaurant Was Somewhat Cheeky. As This Was A Celebration For My Wife's Birthday I Didn't Want To Make A Fuss At The Table.,,,,,
,4550,The Vegetarian Options Were Ok  But The Portions Were Very Small (Especially The Beetroot And Balsamic Vinegar Entrée). We Would Have Expected A Little Bit More Considering It Was Vegetarian And No Protein Were Included In The Dish. I Had The Scallop And Steak And Mine Were Fine.,,,,,
,4551,Bar Menu Not Up To Date- Three Choices Of Drink Selected From Menu Were Unavailable. The Waitress At Breakfast Did Not Advise Us To Help Ourselves ( She Forgot )  And Can't Believe The Plates Were Cold. Very Basic Services That Doesn't Reflect 5* Service,,,,,
,4556,Main Course Was Only Ok  The Steak Was Cold As Was The Plate.,,,,,
,4562,No Awful Would Not Come Again,,,,,
,4564,Staff Were Not Well Managed. Lots Of Different Staff Came To Ask The Same Thing...Slightly Chaotic. Couldnt Get Attention For Bill In Bar And Left. Food Came In A Strange Order During High Tea.I Liked The Staff And They Were All Lovely And Keen To Help But Just A Bit Disorganised.,,,,,
,4565,The Venue  Interior Decoration  Falconry Display  Grounds  And Staff Were 1St Class.  The Food In The Edwardian Bistro However Was Very Poor For The Following Reasons.  1: Our Evening Meal Was Inedible  And Although Replaced We Were Told That It Was Because Of The Richness Of The Truffle Oil! (This Is Not The First Time We Have Tasted Truffle Oil  But The First Time We Have Ever Sent Back A Main Meal.   2: The Breakfast Was Poorly Presented (Stringy Poached Eggs And Fishy Flavoured Bacon) For These Reasons We Regretfully Cannot Recommend Our Stay To Others  Or Plan To Stay Again Ourselves. ,,,,,
,4567,The Staff Could Have Been A Little Bit More On Their Toes; The Food  Especially In The Bar  Had No Flavor.,,,,,
,4573,Although There Seemed To Be Alot Of Staff In The Restaurant They Weren't Necessarily As Attentive I Was Expecting.,,,,,
,4574,Even Though The Dining Room Was Not Very Busy Our Starters Were Barely Warm  We Didn't Complain But When The Main Course Arrived And Was Worse And Our Vegetables Didn't Arrive At All We Had To Send It Back. When It Came Back It Was Hot - Microwaved? Very Disappointing And Not What You Would Expect From A Hotel Of This Standard. All Of The Staff Were Very Apologetic But The Experience On My Wife's Birthday Was Very Poor.,,,,,
,4583,The Only Things We Noticed Was A Smell Of 'Damp Dog' In The Main Restaurant!  Otherwise Very Good.,,,,,
,4584,First Night  First Meal - Our Experience - Shown To A Corner Table Behind Floor To Ceiling Blinds. - 15 Minutes Before Anyone Came To Take Our Order - Seemed Like We'd Been Forgotten About Despite The Restaurant Having Only 3 Other Tables Occupied ( A Total Of 6 Diners) - About A 20-25 Minute Wait For The Food.  Luckily The Bread Was Tasty And Helped To Fill The Time Gap - Mediocre Dover Sole  3 Minute Pieces Of Grilled Mango Overall Disappointing Service Again.,,,,,
,4591,Breakfast Buffet .....Poor  Menu Items Fair Dinner......No Worth The Price......We Dined Out At Ring Of Bells After The First Night  Very  Very Good!,,,,,
,4592,Edwardian Grill Food And Service Was Very Good. Bistro Table And Floor Always Seemed Dirty. Nobody Seemed Interested In Clearing Up Food From The Floor. Breakfast Was Ok But Waiters And Kitchen Staff Seemed To Have No Knowledge Of Preparing Grapefruit. Attempts At This Over Three Days Ranged From Terrible To Poor And Always Took 10 Or 15 Minutes. On Two  Occasions Our Cooked Breakfast Was Brought To Our Table Before The Grapefruit And We Were Then Asked By The Waiter/Waitress What To Do With It!! The Staff In The Bar Between 8 - 9 Pm Seemed Stressed. Not Enough Staff To Prepare The Cocktails Pre Dinner So Guests Were Waiting Quite A Long Time To Be Served.,,,,,
,4593,We Ate In The Edwardian Grill On The First Night  We Had Sirloin Steak  It Was Slightly Chewy. We Ate In The Bistro On The Second Night And Were Very Disappointed In The Food. I Had Mushroom Soup Which Was So Thick And Put Me Off. Then Had Thai Fishcakes Which Were Big Round Balls Of Stodge With Not Much Flavour. We Felt It Was Food Trying To Be Different For Differents Sake. Normal Good Wholesome Food Would Be Better And Nicer Selections Would Be Good. Not Impressed I Am Afraid And Came Away Very Disappointed,,,,,
,4594,The Service In The Bistro Was Very Good - They Agreed To Serve Us Even Though It Was Past The Normal Closing Time And The Food Was Much Better Than Anticipated. The Experience In The Grill Was Not So Good.  We Waited For A Long Time To Be Served With Drinks/Menus In The Bar And Had To Ask For Service 3 Times Before Someone Arrived To Take Orders.  My Steak Was Inedible And Not A Pleasant Experience.  I Did Not Complain (As We Were Guests Of Our Friends For Dinner)  But The Waiter Saw That It Was Tough And Offered To Change For Fish Which Was Much Better.  Generally Those Who Had Fish Had A Better Meal Than Those Who Had Beef.,,,,,
,4595,We Ate In The Edwardian Grill Twice And The Bistro Once; The Evening Service In Both Dining Venues Was Excellent And The Food Was Well Cooked And Presented  However  My Husband Doesn't Like Fish And 3 Nights Of Beef In The Edwardian Grill Would Be Too Much. Even Lamb Would Make A Change From The Beef But Please Add A Lighter Meal Such As Chicken Or Turkey.,,,,,
,4599,We Often Had To Wait Too Long (15-20 Mins?) For Our Food To Be Brought. Staff Were Courteous & Well-Intentioned But Inexperienced And Under Too Much Pressure.,,,,,
,4601,We Had A Set Menu And On Our 2Nd Night  We Were Served And Entrée And Main Both Seafood  Not The Best If You Don't Like Seafood.,,,,,
,4602,Champagne Was Warm  White Wine Tepid And Red Wine Boiling. Steak Was Returned As Incorrectly Cooked. Service Patchy. Bacon Returned At Breakfast Raw!!,,,,,
,4605,I Really Enjoyed Lunch At The Bistro On A Previous Occasion - I Had Venison  It Was Excellent!!  I Was Just Disappointed That We Couldn't Have A Really Nice Dinner In The Bistro On Saturday Night  Because That Kind Of Menu Was Not Available In The Bistro.,,,,,
,4607,Both Eating Venues Were Excellent And The Staff Also Were Superb,,,,,
,4608,Edwardian Grill Was Disappointing. Food Was Over Salty On Several Dishes And Expensive. Bistro Was Better Value For Money But The Pizzas Weren't Particularly Good. Food Was The Only Disappointment In Our Visit.,,,,,
,4609,We Would Have Preferred A Change In The Menu Between The Friday And Saturday  Although There Were A Lot Of Choices But On The Second Night You Are Having Your 2Nd Choice Which Is A Different Feeling.,,,,,
,4610,Choice In Bistro Limited. Lunch On First Day Rather Average,,,,,
,4611,Disappointed The Edwardian Grill Was Closed For A 'Deep Clean' For A Few Days During Our Stay.  Bistro Closing At 6 Pm Left Little Options For Alternative Meals.  Also Felt Meals Were Expensive.  Birthday Meal In The Library Was Excellent.,,,,,
,4613,The Bistro Was A Disappointment. I Do Not Think The Ambience In Here Was Good. Also  On The Day Of Our Arrival We Went To The Bistro And I Had Pasta. I Asked For A Spoon To Go With My Fork Rather Than A Knife And Also For Black Pepper..None On Table. Two People Agreed To Get The Items For Me And Promptly Went Off To Do Other Things! I Complained When Paying The Bill  And The Young Man Went Off And Returned To Say That The 12 And A Half % Service Charge Had Been Removed (Something I Would Not Have Paid Anyway In View Of It Being Supposedly Discretionary).,,,,,
,4614,Service Slow,,,,,
,4615,Both Dinner And Afternoon Tea Were Faultless.  However  I Believe That There Is Significant Room For Improvement With The Ingredients Of The Full English Breakfast. The Sausage And The Black Pudding Were Both Poor.,,,,,
,4617,While Staffing Levels Are High In The Edwardian Grill  At One Dinner There Was A Huge Delay Between The Serving Of The First And Main Courses. The Service At The Castle Bistro Is Well Meaning But Somewhat Chaotic.,,,,,
,4618,The Main Restaurant Was Good But The Bistro Was Very Poor. Service Was Awfull .,,,,,
,4619,We Have Stayed A Number Of Times Over 30 Years And The Choice Of Menu Has Steadily Declined. There Was Only Beef Or Fish On Your Menu  No Venison  Duck Or Even Chicken. I Only Had One Option Which I Liked. Likewise In The Bistro There Were Too Many Pasta Dishes  Again  The Only Option I Liked Was Fish And Chips.,,,,,
,4620,As Mentioned Before The Bistro Food Could Be Much Much Better - More Cafe Type Quality Than Bistro Quality,,,,,
,4622,We Had To Wait Almost An Hour For Our Food Despite The Fact There Were A Lot Of Staff And Not Many Guests In The Bistro. Despite Asking Where Our Food Was We Still Had A Long Wait And Were Eventually Told There Had Been A Blip. One Of Us Had Ordered A Burger Asking For It To Be Dairy Free But It Came With Cheese. A New Burger Did Come Without Cheese. This Was Nothing Short Of Dreadful Service.,,,,,
,4624,Night One Our Main Meal Was Brought To Our Table Before We Had Finished Our Starter. Night Two We Arrived At 2000 Hours As Requested Didn't Get Our Table Till 820 And Food Didn't Arrive Till Nearly 2100 Looked The Food Like It Was On Its Last Legs I Think We Got The Last Scraps That Was Left!! And Dessert Was Ice Cream Or One Other. Badly Organised ...,,,,,
,4626,Ludicrously Expensive And Not That Special. The Staff Were Very Slow To Get Us Our Drinks,,,,,
,4629,Yes  My Wife's Breakfast- Smoked Haddock Was Very Small Indeed And Cold Dinner Was Excellent,,,,,
,4630,I Had Room Service On Both Nights And The Standard Of The Food Was Very Mediocre. I Had Room Service Breakfast On The First Morning  Firstly Got The Wrong Breakfast Order  The Toast Was Cold  The Correct Food Then Brought Cold Hard Bacon And Luke Warm Hard Scrambled Egg. Truly Awful. So I Went Down To Breakfast On The Second Morning  This Was An Equally Dire Experience  Waited Over 15 Minutes For Two Poached Eggs. They Came On An Enormous Plate Looked Totally Disgusting And Were Luke Warm Again. How You Can Possibly Justify £14.95 For That I Just Do Not Know.,,,,,
,4632,The Staff Were Attentive And Highly Trained.  However I Left Our Breakfast Arrangements With Them And Clearly This Information Was Not Passed On To The Morning Staff  So Unfortunately I Am Disappointed With The Follow On Service.,,,,,
,4634,A Change Of Menu In The Edwardian Would Be Nice If Staying More Than One Night.,,,,,
,4636,No Water Provided With The Meal And We Had To Ask Each Evening. No Bread Supplied Either Meal Was Cold On One Of The Evenings.,,,,,
,4637,The Bistro Was A Little Disappointing.  When We Arrived On Friday Afternoon  We Asked If We Could Have Afternoon Tea On The Terrace But We Were Told It Was Fully Booked And Yet Prior To Arrival We Didn't Know That We Would Need To Book This (Which Would Have Been A Little Difficult Anyway As We Weren't Sure How Long Our Journey Would Take  Coming From Buckinghamshire.,,,,,
,4640,I Ordered Mussels As A Main Course In The Bistro. Half Of The Mussels Shells Were Closed. I Commented To The Waitress Who Told The Chef. There Was No Comment Or Apology Forthcoming. I Also Had To Asked To Be Served. Being A Woman Travelling Alone  I Was Not Recognised As A Potential Customer.,,,,,
,4641,I Thought The Attire Of The People Serving Us At The Wedding Breakfast Was Not As Tidy As The Reception Staff. They Didn't Seem To Have A Uniform?,,,,,
,4643,Standard Of Meals And Presentation Let The Hotel Down In Both Restaurants.  Breakfast Was Chaotic On Our First Day And Continental Selection Was Poor.  Tea In The Oak Room Was  However  Very Good.,,,,,
,4644,Drinks Particularly Cocktails Were Overpriced But Otherwise Bovey Castle Has Something For Everyone.  We Thoroughly Enjoyed Breakfast And Dinner In The Edwardian Grill  Dinner In The Bistro And Afternoon Tea In The Lounge (The Cakes Were Divine).,,,,,
,4648,We Felt Service Could Have Been Better.  Some Of The Staff Just Did Not Seem Too Bothered. But Frederico Sorted Things If Only All Staff Had His High Standards,,,,,
,4649,I Thought The Menu In The Bistro Was Dull  We Went To The Ring Of Bells In North Bovey One Evening And Thought It Much Better (Than The Bistro),,,,,
,4650,Service In Bistrol Was Slow - Didn't Receive Our Starter - Pizza Orderered Didn't Have Any Basil As Per Menu - Waitress Apologised And Didn't Charge Us For The Meal - This Was A One Off  We Eat The Following Day And Everything Was Ok,,,,,
,4651,The Bistro Was Short Staffed And Service Was Very Slow  Staff That Were There Worked Really Hard.,,,,,
,4652,The Edwardian Grill Was Obviously Far More Enjoyable To Dine In Than The Castle Bistro Though The Menu Prices Were Exorbitant By Comparison And Our Allowance Was Insufficient To Cover A Three Course Dinner Pre-Booked For Both Nights !,,,,,
,4653,We Feel That The Bistro Is Not Worthy Of Being Part Of A 5 Star Hotel.  We Chose To Dine There Because We Had Stayed In Three Different Hotels Before Arriving At Bovey And Had Enjoyed Fine Dining In Each Of Them.  We Thought That We Would Prefer A Lighter Evening Meal At Bovey.  Sadly We Didn't Ask To See The Menu In Advance.  The Choice Of Menu And Quality Of Food Was  In Our Opinion  Poor.  Service Was Very Slow Despite The Bistro Not Being Very Busy.  The Staff Were  However  Very Courteous And Friendly.,,,,,
,4654,The Menu In The Bistro Got A Bit Boring By The Fourth Evening. Sometimes The Presentation Was Disappointing Especially The Sweets!,,,,,
,4656,The Ribeye Steak Was Too Chewey. Very Little Choice Of Meat. I Would Suggest To Review The Menu. Hamburgers As A Child Dish  Then 2 Simple Meat Choices  1 Chicken  I Fish  One Vegi And One Pasta Choices. The Pizza Was Excellent Accoring To My Children  The Starters Also Nice.,,,,,
,4658,Preferred The Food In The Bistro To The Meal We Had Last Visit In The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,4660,Quite Expensive.,,,,,
,4661,My Husband's Meal Was Good  However  Mine Was Dry And Over Cooked. It Put Me Off Eating Any More Food. I Wouldn't Eat There Again Or Recommend It To Friends.,,,,,
,4663,Too Large And Cold Atmosphere,,,,,
,4664,Loved The Food But Was Disappointed That My Main Course Was Not What Had Been Ordered And To Save Making A Fuss Did Mention It To Waiter And Said I Would Eat The Meal That Had Been Supplied By Mistake,,,,,
,4665,Wine Expensive,,,,,
,4667,Very Expensive. We've Had Many Meals Of Equal Or Superior Quality For A Fraction Of The Cost. Presentation Was Excellent  But That Doesn't Alter The Quality Of The Food.,,,,,
,4669,Draught Beer Was Not Available In The Evening For My Husband,,,,,
,4670,Sorry To Say But We Thought That The Staff In The Restaurant Were Poorly Trained And Managed.  Nobody Seemed To Be In Charge  Giving Directions.  The Service Definitely Did Not Merit A Mandatory 12 1/2 % Tip For Hotel Guests.,,,,,
,4671,Breakfast Service Less Effective Than Dinner. Menu Too Dominated By Beef  Excellent Though It Was!,,,,,
,4674,Our Party Have All Commented That The Food Was Warm Not Hot  The Steaks Had Too Much Fat And Gristle   And Apology Accepted From Staff We Were Left Without A Wine Service Until We Requested Our Glasses Be Topped Up. Complimentary Glass Of Water Offered By Way Of Apology .,,,,,
,4675,Staff Made Too Many Personal Comments Eg ' I Don't Like The Tiramasu' When Asked To Describe It And Poor Description Made  Listing The Look Of The Item; Another Describing Their Recent 'Car Prang' In The Snow...,,,,,
,4676,I Feel The Vegetarian Options Could Be More Exciting - To Match The Rest Of The Meat/Fish Menu.,,,,,
,4677,We Ordered The Rosotto And It Was Not That Good.  Service Was Good But Not Great.,,,,,
,4683,The Staff And The Service Were Absolutely Top Class Supervised Throughout By A Very Friendly And Efficient Rachel.,,,,,
,4687,Breakfast Dissapointing  Stained Table Cloths And Used Crockery On Table First Day. Second Day Not Offered Any Toast Or Kitchen Items Wanted Both !!,,,,,
,4689,We Had Sole In The Dining Room Which  For The High Profile Image  We Didn't Think Was Amazing.  However We Did Enjoy The Atmosphere And The Overall Experience.,,,,,
,4692,If The Food Was Served Hot I Would Have Enjoyed It.The Salt And Pepper Should Have Been On The Table.Service Was Slow,,,,,
,4695,I Was Very Impressed That The Ourdoor 'Hog Roast' Was Almost A Formal Dining Experience.  Tables Were Set Up Beautifully And Service Was Very Attentive And Friendly.,,,,,
,4697,Seamless Service And Very Tolerant Staff Considering How Boisterous We Were As A Group. The Female Staff In Particular Were Simply Amongst The Best  And Fully Engaged In The Night With Completely Appropriate Response To Our Celebrations - They Seemed To Enjoy Being There Almost As Much As We Did!,,,,,
,4698,Poor Brasserie Menu And Food Quality But Good In Edwardian Restaurant,,,,,
,4700,The Bistro Leaves A Bit To Be Desired.  Stir Fry Vegetables Should Be Just That And Not A Bit Of A Mash.  No Complaints About The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,4701,Yes The Maitre D' (Rachel) Was Excellent And Extremely Professional. One Of The Best I Have Come Across In All My Frequent Travels,,,,,
,4702,Our Experience At The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent - From Food To Service.  Our Experience In The Bistro Was Quite Different As We Didn't Care For The Atmosphere And The Service Was Not Good.,,,,,
,4703,For The Cost Of Dining In The Edwardian Grill  I Would Expect Better Quality And Selection. Deserts Should Be `Special`Not The Same Old Choices. Breakfast On Friday Was Ok  Why For Breakfast On Saturday Do You Need To Put The `Troughs` Of Food. For The Cost  The Only Way Is To Present The Food Is To Be Served It. Toast Should Be Always Served In A Toast Rack  Not On A Plate  As It Gets `Moist`. You Would Be Well Advised To Raise Your Game.,,,,,
,4704,We Had Afternoon Tea - 4 Scones And Two Very Mediocre Cappuccinos For Over £30. The Next Day We Had The Same In Moretonhampstead - It Was Much Better At A Third The Price.  We Also Had Dinner In The Bistro. I Had A Burger Which Was Rather Dry With The Strangest Chips - Almost Like Twiglets. My Wife Had Spaghetti Which Was So Salty She Complained And Was Given A 50% Discount. The Meal Wasn't A Disaster But We Expected More Given The Reputation Of The Hotel,,,,,
,4705,Your Staff Are Excellent.,,,,,
,4707,The Staff In The Restaurant Seemed Not As Knowledgeable As One Could Expect From The Kind Of Venue Bovey Is.,,,,,
,4710,I Would Rate The Edwardian Grill As Excellent Across The Board And The Bistro As Average - Both In Ambiance And Food Choice And Quality.  I Know You Are Trying To Appeal To Families With The Bistro But It Does Feel Like A Coffee Shop On The M4.  Why Not Serve A Few Really Tasty Limited Menu In The Bar For Those Who Don't Want A Fancy Dinner Every Night But Aren't Attracted To The Bistro?  We Really Enjoyed The Ring Of Bells Pub In North Bovey Two Nights. I Think Similar Food Would Be Very Popular In The Bar - Could Even Have Quite Limited Hours So The Bar Is Still There For Those Who Just Want A Drink.,,,,,
,4711,Whilst The Staff In The Bistro We Excellent The Venue Lacked 'Bistro' Atmosphere And The Menu Was Somewhat Limited.,,,,,
,4713,Service (Especially At Breakfast) Was Slow And Very Poor. No 'One Person' Seemed To Be In Charge Of Specific Tables At Breakfast And It Was Hard To Attract Anyones Attention. Even After Ordering The Wait For Food Was Unacceptable.,,,,,
,4715,The Edwardian Grill Wasn't Upto The Standard For Bovey Either For Breakfast Or Evening. If I Had Been On My Own I Would Have Walked Out.  It Seemed As Though We Were In The Way.,,,,,
,4716,It Could Have Been So Much Better. The Menus Read Superbly But The Execution Lacked The Degree Of Excellence Which Was Implied. Sadly This Was Particularly So For Dinner In The Edwardian Room. Also The Bottle Of Chablis Ordered To Accompany Our Meal Was Way Below Par; Displaying None Of The Fresh  Crisp  Flinty [Steely] Characteristics For Which It Is Renowned. All Considered This Was A Hugely Disappointing 'Black Hole' In An Otherwise Enjoyable Experience At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,4717,Ridiculous Prices And Breakfast As Evidenced To Manager A Disgrace.,,,,,
,4718,On My First Morning In The Edwardian Grill My Order Was Forgotten And I Had To Wait Over Half An Hour For My Breakfast. The Food In The Bistro Was Very Poor And On The Second Night It Was Inedible. The Staff Were Unable To Provide My Wine Of Choice. It Was The Worst Food I Have Ever Eaten And Did Not Meet A Two Star Status Let Alone Five Star Status.,,,,,
,4719,The Executive Chef Helped Us When We Were Looking For A Menu On Friday Afternoon.  He Was Very Guest Focused And Answered All Our Questions.  The Lady Who Runs The Bistro Was Extremely Friendly And Persuaded Us To Dine In The Bistro On Saturday Night.  She Is A Real Asset To The Business.,,,,,
,4720,My Answers Were For The Bistro  However We Dined In The Edwardian One Night And My Answers For There Would Be 'Excellent'.,,,,,
,4721,We Did Not Expect Cold Plates And Hot Food Gone Cold On The Hot Breakfast Buffet.,,,,,
,4722,The Food Was Very Good. We Particularly Enjoyed The Simplicity And Service In The Bistro. The Only Criticism Is The Limited Choice In Both Restaurants.,,,,,
,4723,The Food In The Bistro On The First Night Was Disappointing. I Had A Rib Eye Steak Which Was Chewy. The Tart Dessert Was Overcooked. My Wife Had Fish And Chips And Said The Fish Batter Was Greasy. On The Second Night In The Restaurant My Wife's Beef Main Course Was Cold. I Had Monkfish Which Was Nice But The Portion Was Minute And There Were Virtually No Vegetables.,,,,,
,4725,Lacked Atmosphere On Mid Week Nov. Evenings. Background Music Did Not Help. Not Sufficient Variety In The Menu For A 4 Night Stay.,,,,,
,4726,The Service At Breakfast Was Poor  No One Explained The Procedure. I Waited 25 Mins For A Very Dry Uneatable Omelet. Asked For Tea Got Coffee,,,,,
,4727,My Husband Thought The Mackerel Starter Was To Die For!  We Were Very Impressed With The Food Overall  The Afternoon Tea Was Absolutely Scrummy  And I Had The Bet Lemon Sole In The Bistro That I Have Had In Many Years!,,,,,
,4728,On Our First Evening We Went For A Drink In The Oak Bar. We Were Handed Drinks Menus But Then Forgotten About. Others Arrived In The Interim And Were Served But Eventually We Gave Up And Returned To Our Room And Made Ourselves A Drink.,,,,,
,4729,A Nice Atmosphere,,,,,
,4730,We Had Mussels For Lunch In The Bistro And They Were Overcooked But Not To Spoil The Lunch We Didn't Complain And Finished Lunch. In The Afternoon We Had Tea And Coffee And The Coffee Was Cold. A New One Was Given But It Was Awful But We Felt Too Embarrased To Complain Again. We Also Ordered Biscuits But They Never Turned Up. The Evening Meal In The Edwardian Grill Was Good  Apart From The Ice Cream  We Couldn't Tell What Flavour Was What. The Waiting Staff Were Very Pleasant And We Enjoyed Chatting To Them. Breakfast Offered A Fantastic Choice But Unfortunatley After Asking For Black Pudding  It Arrived After I Finished The Breakfast With The Chef's Apologies.,,,,,
,4732,The Staff Were Somewhat Indifferent  Particularly In The Bar But Agnes Was Very Helpful When We Dined In The Edwardian Grill  Although A Little Reserved To Start With.,,,,,
,4733,Diner Was Average. Breakfast Was Just O.K We Had A Club Sandwich In The  Grill And Was Awful This Is A Real Shame As On Previous Stays In The Hotel It Has All Been Exellant,,,,,
,4736,Thought The Menu Options Strange; Either Basic Burger In The Bistro Or An Expensive Restaurant With No -Accredditation (Aa Rossettes Or A Michelin Star) And No Real Indication Of Seasonal Fresh Food - Just A Standard Menu Which Made Me Think It Would All Be From The Freezer. So My £60 Meal Allowance Was Not Spendable In The Bistro And Was A Too Little For A Basic Restaurant.  Left Me Feeling Slightly Cheated; So Dropped My Overall Score From Definite Return To A Maybe.,,,,,
,4737,I Was Informed That I Could Only Eat In The Bistro At 6.30 P.M. On Saturday As The Dining Room And Bistro Was Full.  Having Waited For My Room To Be Released  I Had Lunch At 1.45 P.M. And So Needed Little In The Evening. Having Arrived At 6.30P.M. To An Almost Empty Bistro  It Remained That Way Until I Left At 7.45 P.M.!!!,,,,,
,4739,The Breakfast's Were Very High Standard And Delicious.,,,,,
,4740,We Waited Lmost 45 Minutes On The First Night Before We Were Given Our Starter (25 Minutes To Order).  When The Starter Arrived  My Partner  Who Had Ordered Prawns And Crayfish  Was Unable To Locate Any Crayfish In Amongst The Prawns.  We Were Then Told The Kitchen Had Run Out Of The Former!  On The Second Night  My Partner Ordered The Liver.  The Third Piece Of Liver Was Raw Inside - Literally Oozing With Blood.  The Restaurant Itself Was Noisy - Certainly Not A Peaceful Atmosphere.,,,,,
,4743,Disappointing Choice  Told That They Were Freshly Prepared Burgers But Had To Be Served Well Done? The Local Pub Asked For Cooking Preference As Soon As A Burger Was Ordered. The Edwardian Grill Was Fully Booked  But Due To My Wife's Allergies There Was Nothing Other Than Steaks To Choose From.,,,,,
,4744,The Young Staff Struggled To Deliver That Consistent High Level Of Service You Would Expect From A Establishment Such As Bovey Castle,,,,,
,4746,Very Disappointed With The Bistro. A Very Limited Menu Then To Be Told Further Parts Of The Menu Were Unavailable Then Deciding On A Pizza To Be Told That There Was No Dough And Then While Considering An Alternative Meal I Was Then Informed Dough Was Obtained From The Other Kitchen On Being Served It Was Obviously Not Enough As It Was So Thin In Some Parts It Was Like Eating A Crisp And On Other Parts There Was No Covering.  On Ordering A Second Pint Of Peroni Nastro I Was Not Surprised To Hear That There Was None Available. I Was Asked By The Waitress If My Wife And Myself Enjoyed The Meal I Informed Her Of My Disappointment Of The Dining Experience She Later Told Me That She Had Reported My Complaint To The Manager And That He Would See Me The Next Morning Which He Did Not Do.,,,,,
,4747,Thought The Food Was Disappointing For 5 Star Hotel Same For Breakfast,,,,,
,4748,Castle Bistro Very Noisy And Red Lighting Spoils The Castle Experience. We Were Delayed Due To Inclement Weather But The Chef Kindly Prepared Food  Although It Was Very Basic And Very Little Choice. Breakfast Buffet Was Very Limited And Poor.  Afternoon Tea We Were Told Was Going To Be Served In The Cosy Piano Bar But Instead Was Served In The Cold No Atmosphere  Empty Corner Of The Edwardian Grill.  This Was To Be A Special Birthday Treat For My Brother  So We Complained But Only Got A Slight  Reduction Off The Bill  However The Afternoon Tea In A Stunning Castle Experience Was Ruined.  The Manager Requested To Speak To Us The Next Morning But He Was Nowhere To Be Found  So We Cancelled Our Evening Reservation For Dinner In The Edwardian Grill.  We Would Never Dine Here Again.,,,,,
,4749,No Water Served With The Meal Without Requesting It Each Time.  A Little Bread Would Also Have Been Appreciated,,,,,
,4752,Boring Limited Menu! Burgers Fish An Chips And Pizza Not What We Expected At 5 Star Hotel.  Bun Rock Hard. Waitress Agreed An Offered Free Dessert.  Specials Board And Fish Dishes Would Add More Choice.,,,,,
,4756,Go To The Castle Cafe In Chagworth  Locally Sourced  Excellent . Your Bistro Should Be Able To Do As Well.,,,,,
,4757,We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Entire Experience Of Dining In The Bistro.The Service Excellent With Cheerful Staff (Probably Better Than Our Previous Experience In The Grill) And The Food Was 1St Class.Compliments To The Chef.,,,,,
,4759,We Have Not Eaten In The Edwardian Grill During Our Last Few Stays At Bovey.  This Is Because We Had Not Been Very Impressed On Previous Visits.  We Did Talk About Trying It Again On Our Next Visit (Used The Bistro This Time As Had Grandchildren With Us) But Breakfast In The Edwardian Grill Was Very Poor And This Has Put Us Off.,,,,,
,4761,Menu Could Have Been A Bit More Varied,,,,,
,4762,Need To Get Teas And Coffees Hot. Need To Know Who Ordered What To Take Service Up A Level,,,,,
,4763,The Room Was A Mix Of Edwardian And New (Chair Backs?) I Felt Its Identity Was Lost As An Edwardian Room - Perhaps Screens Would Be Useful To Make It Appear Cosier And Less 'Open Plan'.,,,,,
,4764,Did Not Like The 12 1/2 % Service Charge Automatically Added To The Bill. To Argue Against It Puts The Diner In An Uncomfortable Position.,,,,,
,4765,We Agreed That We Have Had Better Meals At Other Devon Restaurants But We Enjoyed Eating With You.,,,,,
,4766,Too Many Staff Hovering Around My Table Asking Questions About My Satisfaction With Meal.  Main Entree A Let-Down.  Cheese Platter Excellent.,,,,,
,4768,The Table For Which We Came To The Restaurant To Select During The Afternoon  Appeared To Be Reserved When We Arrived For Dinner. The Sommelier Should Learn How To Handle A Bottle. And A Winelist Organised According To Prize Does Not Enhance A Quality Image Of The Restaurant. Unfortunate  Since The Food Was Excellent.,,,,,
,4769,Vastly Overpriced And Not Of A Quality Commensurate With The Bill Or Description Ie Lot Of Hype,,,,,
,4772,Like Fawlty Towers With Poor Food And Dishonest Staff,,,,,
,4779,A Good Meal With A Varied Menu. Some Staff Excelled Over Others. Mr Shapland Had The Fillet Steak Which He Said Was The Best He Had Ever Had.,,,,,
,4780,You Will Always Have A Problem Being A Hotel With A Golf Course That Groups Of Single Men Will Understandably Be A Little Loud For Other Guests.,,,,,
,4781,Please Note Previous Comments,,,,,
,4782,Again  Our  Experiences Were Mixed.  We Dined In The Edwardian Grill For 2 Breakfasts And 2 Dinners.  At Times The Service Was Friendly  Helpful  And Professional; At Other Times It Was Rude  Oblivious  And Inefficient.  At Times The Food Was Quite Good; At Other Times  It Was Less Than Expected.,,,,,
,4783,Our Experience At The Edwardian Grill Was Mixed.  We Had 2 Breakfasts And 2 Dinners There.  At  Times The Service Was Friendly  Polite And Professional; At Other Times It Was Ignorant  Oblivious  And Rude.  The Food At Times Was Fairly Good; At Other Times It Was Sorely Lacking.,,,,,
,4784,The Service Was Not The Best. Different Staff Waited On Our Table & Did Not Know Who Had Ordered What And So Spent Some Time Sorting It Out. At Breakfast The Service Was Slow As Was The Food.,,,,,
,4786,Both Food And Service Was Brilliant.,,,,,
,4787,Quality Of Dinner Food Excellent  But Lack Of Variation In Menu Day To Day And Limited Choice In Meat Dishes Means You Quickly Exhaust Preferences And Desire To Eat In Edwardian Grill. Size And Layout Of Grill Gives Little Atmosphere Or Privacy.  The Service At Breakfast Was Appallingly Slow - 45 Minutes To Produce A Cooked Breakfast Off The Menu Is Wholly Unacceptable.,,,,,
,4790,We Wanted To Have A Light Breakfast And This Option Would Be Great If It Were Available In The Bistro Before 10 A.M.,,,,,
,4792,Service Slow At Breakfast Particularly At Peak Times. Had To Wait Half An Hour For Table Each Morning.,,,,,
,4794,The Earliest Booking Was 9.00 Pm Which We Accepted But In Fact When We Were Finally Shown To Our Table It Was After 9.30Pm So Very Late Indeed (The Staff Did Provide Us With An Additional Complimentary Drink During The Extended Wait),,,,,
,4795,You Do No Obviously Not Hold Your Guests'knowledge Of Wine In Any Respect  If You Have A Wine List Organised On The Basis Of Price. Most People Would Select On Basis Of Taste And Quality. Apparently Unknown Parameters At Bovey; Price Is More Important ?? It Explains At Least Why The Bottle Was 'Manhandled' By Thye Acting Sommelier Of The Day. We Took The Trouble Of Going Down To The Restaurant In Order To Reserve A Specific Table  But Upon Arrival That Was Of Course Taken.,,,,,
,4796,Disappointing,,,,,
,4797,Breakfast Service Was Slow Once The Manager Appeared It Speeded Up,,,,,
,4799,It Would Be Nice To See Candlelabras On All Tables We Had Just A Tee Light   I Asked For Strong Tea At Breakfast And Got A Pot With One Tea Bak And When The Toast Arrived On A Dish I Asked For A Toast Rack As The Toast Goes Soggy To Be Told That They Had Run Out Of Toast Racks  How Sad That A Hotel Of This Standard Cannot Afford To But Half A Dozen More Toast Racks!!. My Husband Asked For His Egg On A Side Plate And Not On The Main Plate And It Came On The Main Plate!! Is There A Language Barrier With Some Of Your Staff?,,,,,
,4800,The Restaurant Is V Ery Expensive And The Dress Code Is Not Adhered To,,,,,
,4801,We Were Very Impressed And Couldn't Believe You Have No Aa Rosettes.,,,,,
,4802,Your Staff Are Good,,,,,
,4807,Expensive!!,,,,,
,4808,We Found The Alrgish Table Made It Harder For My Father To Hear Us Without Raising Voices. The Table Was On The Edge Of The Dining Room So It Felt Rather Isolated. You Had A Couple Of Larger Parties In Which May Have Affected The Quality Fo The Food  But The Fillet Steak Was Dissapointingly Dry.,,,,,
,4810,Thought It Rather Petty Being Asked To Pay An Extra £2 For Breakfast  Having Not Being Toldthat B&B Meant An Allocation!,,,,,
,4812,Service Was A Bit Hit And Miss  Staff Very Friendly But Didn.T Serve With Thier Heads Up,,,,,
,4817,No Member Of Staff Asked For Comments On Satisfaction Even Though It Was Clear That More Than Half Of My Dinner Was Left. This Was The Same In The Morning When My Scrambled Eggs Were Clearly Burned. They Should Not Have Been Served As They Must Have Stuck To The Pan And Were Discoloured. Style Is Valued Over Substance  But It Is Not Cheap And You Need Both. The Bistro For Lunch Was A Much Better Balance And Nicer Experience. We Do These Short Breaks Often And Have A Good Base For Comparison.,,,,,
,4824,Very Nice Staff But Over Attentive  Food Was Ok,,,,,
,4832,Food Was Good But Expensive!,,,,,
,4833,Waitress Seemed A Little Inexperienced And There Was A Small Language Problem That Resulted In An Incorrect Meal. Music Was Way Too Loud Initially But Was Turned Down On Request. Otherwise Excellent. Breakfast Could Do With Some Muesli  Other Than Granola.,,,,,
,4838,The Quality Of The Food Was Good And The Staff Helpful And Attentive. The Wine List Although Extensive Was Depleted By A Large Number Of The More Popular Less Expensive Wines Not Being Available  Again Disappointing For A Quality Hotel. The Brasserie Food Was Good Although Wine That Was Available On The Sunday When We Arrived Was No Longer Available By The Monday By Lunchtime,,,,,
,4843,The Menu In The Edwardian Room Was Restrictive  On Both The Entree And Main Courses Only Beef Or Fish My Wife Had Difficulty Choosing Perhaps Some Game Or Poultry ?,,,,,
,4844,I Do Not Like Buffet Breakfast Arrangments  And The Wine Ordered By The Glass Was Different  Although Offered As The Same. As We Stayed Two Nights  It Was A Pity Some Aspects Of The Menus Did Not Change,,,,,
,4846,Edwardian Staff Excellent. Bistro Staff Pushed To Keep Pace,,,,,
,4847,We Were Not Happy To Have Been Charged A Service Charge For Dining In The Edwardian Grill On Top Of A Service Charge On Our Overall Package.,,,,,
,4848,See Tripadvisor Comments Re Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,4849,We Had Lunch In The Bistro And Considering Ther Were Only Two Others In There The Service Was Very Slow,,,,,
,4850,Very Slow Service,,,,,
,4855,Difficult To Say As We Were Part Of A Very Large Party. Food Was Average And We Were Given Coffee Cups But No Coffee Or Tea Was Offered. ,,,,,
,4856,We Thought The Self Service English Breakfast Was Disappointing,,,,,
,4859,The Edwardian Grill Was Full - To Be Fair This Was Advised Beforehand- On The Night They Allowed Us To Have The Steak Off Their Grill Menu However Which We Ate In The Bistro... The Bistro Menu Felt Was A Little Basic Especially For Evening Weekend Dining And The Bistro Itself Wasn't That Appealing - Bright Lights/ No Table Cloths .. Having Said That Service And Quality Of Food V Good- I Am Happy With Informal Dining - If It Had Been Gastro Pub Type Food - Somehow The Bistro Doesn't Feel Like Rest Of The Amenities- Lack Of Atmospher Etc- Not Major Issue But Compared To Rest Of Hotel Felt The Style Doesn't Fit As Well ,,,,,
,4863,Had To Ask A Couple Of Times If We Could Order Our Food After Nearly 20 Mins Waiting Even Though Only About 4 Tables Occupied In Restaurant. ,,,,,
,4867,Food Was Good But Not Excellent  Having Dined At Many Four And Five Star Hotels I Feel That Bovey Let Itself Down In This Respect Especially At Breakfast.,,,,,
,4868,The Speed Of Ordering The Food Was Not Quick At Lunch Time.,,,,,
,4869,Poor Sweet Selection... Only 2 ,,,,,
,4870,We Were Moved Into A Smaller Less Atmospheric Room On Two Of Our Three Evenings And While I Understand This In The Light Of The Low Occupancy At The Time Of Our Stay  Had We Known In Advance We May Have Decided To Dine In The Bistro.,,,,,
,4871,Dinner Was Rather Disappointing - Though When Catering For A Large Party You Do Not Expect Real Fine Dining.   Hoped For Better.,,,,,
,4872,The Bistro Needs To Up Their Game !,,,,,
,4875,The Service For The Dinner Was Pretty Slow,,,,,
,4880,Castle Bistro Was Lovely  The Whole Evening But With The Problems The Following Night I Could Not Really Enjoy Our Meal In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,4882,Excellent!,,,,,
,4885,Service Was Extremely Slow.  Eastern European Servers Spoke Very Poor English And Made Mistakes With Ordering.,,,,,
,4889,Will Come Back,,,,,
,4890,Thought The Decor Was Not In Keeping With The Rest Of The Hotel.  Food Was Good First Night But Poor Second Night.  The Burgers Were Too Salty And Inedible  However  The Manager Provided Excellent Service,,,,,
,4893,The Castle Bistro Design And Decor Lets The Hotel Down.  Feels Like Something At A Shopping Centre  Very At Odds With The Rest Of The Hotel's Excellent Design.,,,,,
,4894,We Ate In Both Of The Restaurants And The Food Was Excellent. However It Would Have Been Nice If There Was A Different Menu Available For Lunch Or Dinner In The Castle Bistro As The Weekend We Stayed We Were Unable To Have Lunch In Any Of The Lounges As They Were Fully Booked For Afternoon Tea On Both Days Of Our Stay. This Meant We Had To Eat In The Castle Bistro For Lunch And Dinner On The Saturday And Again Sunday Lunchtime - A Lunch Menu With Some Lighter Bites (Sandwiches/Wraps Etc) Would Be Lovely.,,,,,
,4895,If I Was Staying Longer I Would Like To See A Bigger Menu,,,,,
,4898,Atmosphere Could Have Been 'Cosier' And More Intimate,,,,,
,4900,Liked The Bistro  But The Menu In The Flag Ship Dining Room Was For Me A Tad Boring  Great If You Like Steak  Which I Do  But My Fillet Was Tough.,,,,,
,4901,We Had Reservations At The Edwardian Restaurant On The Evening Before Our Departure But This Reservation Was Not Honored When A Large Group Reserved The Entire Restaurant.  Alterntaive Arrangements Offered Were Not Satisfactory So We Ate Elsewhere.,,,,,
,4902,The Menu In The Bistro Was Very Limited  Especially When A Couple Of Things Were Also Not Available. We Had Previously Been Made Presumptive Reservations In The Bistro For Both Nights Of Our Stay And I Am Very Glad That I Rung Up And Changed These As I Would Have Been Very Unhappy To Eat There Twice. The Dining In The Grill Was Incredible Though  As Was The Sunday Lunch Menu.   More Choice On The Menu And Ensuring That Everything Was In Stock Would Have Made The Bistro A Great Option For A Less Formal Evening Though.,,,,,
,4905,Home Made Jam/Marmalade Would Be An Added Touch And Small Pastries Croissants And Pain Au Chocolate For Breakfast Would Be Nicer Rather Than Large Danish Pastriesetc,,,,,
,4906,We Were Fortunate With The Weather But It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had An Area Where We Could Have Undercover Refreshments With Our Little Dog...We Had To Leave Her In The Car As She Is Not Used To Being Caged.,,,,,
,4908,Service At Dinner Was Generally Ok But It Seemed Like You Were Short-Staffed As The Meal Delivered To The Room Was Very Slow. Also  All Of The Pre-Paid Wine Mysteriously Dissapeared From The Tables To Teh Kicthen Once The Meal Was Finished. Did We See A Credit For Unused Wine?,,,,,
,4909,It Was A Conference Gala Dinner Rather Than Wedding,,,,,
,4913,The Pizzas Were Overdone  The Crust So Hard I Have Never Had Such An Awful Pizza  I Couldn't Even Cut It With A Knife That Is How Hard And Dried Out It Was. The Service Was Slow And Inefficient.,,,,,
,4915,With Small Children We Were Really Tied To The Bistro And A Wider Menu Would Have Been Nice When We Were Having Lunch And Dinner In There Every Day,,,,,
,4917,The Dinner In The Evening Was Excellent But More Bar Staff Were Needed For The Amount Of People Attending.The Breakfast The Following Morning Was Pretty Dreadful It Was Cold  Had To Wait For Things To Be Replenished Tables Weren't Cleared  Pretty Disappointing,,,,,
,4918,Food In Edwardian Grill - Excellent. Castle Bistro - Good,,,,,
,4922,Staff Were Very Slow And Seemed Disorganised.,,,,,
,4926,We Were A Little Disappointed That The Menu Was The Same For Botyh Friday And Saturday Nights,,,,,
,4929,Sadly No Time To Sample The Edwardian Restuarant  Another Time.,,,,,
,4937,No,,,,,
,4939,We Were Informed That The Dress Code For The Edwardian Grill Was No Denim. We Were Rather Disappointed That A Gentleman On The Next Table Was Wearing Denim Jeans ,,,,,
,4941,More Varied Menu Required In The Bistro.,,,,,
,4942,Great Breakfast Selection. ,,,,,
,4947,Lose The Fake Flowers,,,,,
,4952,We Really Enjoyed The Edwardian Grill But Felt The Castle Bistro Let The Side Down A Bit  We Understand It Is Not Fine Dining But Were Disappointed In The Quality Of The Food  A B It Second Rate For Such A Nice Hotel,,,,,
,4954,Beautiful Dining Room With A Lovely Atmosphere.,,,,,
,4955,Standards Were Good Despite Only Being About 12 People In The Restaurant. I Thought The Decor Could Do With Some Refreshing As It Seems Dated,,,,,
,4956,Don't Like The Piped Music In The Bistro And Should Be Fresh Flowers On The Tables.,,,,,
,4958,Change Menus Or Add Daily Specials,,,,,
,4961,Our Dinner And Dessert Was Lovely.  Breakfast Was Very Nice. However  My Wife Was Bought Vegetarian Sausages Which Were Still Frozen From The Inside.  Although They Were Redone  It Was Disappointing To See The Amount Of Time It Took. Except For This Slight Hickup  We Had A Wonderful Dining Experience And The Food Was Nice And Fresh And The Breakfast Layout Was Of Exceptionally Good Quality.,,,,,
,4963,The Castle Bistro Served Excellent Food  And Reasonably Priced. The Atmosphere Of The Bistro Was Not In Keeping With The Rest Of The Hotel. The Wine Was Very Overpriced.  The Breakfast In The Edwardian Grill However Was Exceptional! ,,,,,
,4973,We Really Enjoyed The Edwardian Grill (Rated Above). I Had The Vegetables As My Main & Have Never Had Such A Tasty Vegetarian Dish.  However I Would Rate The Bistro "Fair"- The Food & Presentation Was Below Pub Standard (& Certainly Below My Own Kitchen).,,,,,
,4974,Lovely Food  Spoilt But  Very Slow Service   I Would Not Expect To Wait This Long At This Level Of Hotel ,,,,,
,4975,We Were Not Given A Choice And  Felt That We Had Been Put In The Bistro As We Had A Good Deal And Were Not Paying The Normal Full Price For The Room.  The Bistro Was Nearly Empty And There Were No Table Cloths On The Tables Which Made The Room Feel A Little Bit Like A Cafe Rather Than A Restaurant. ,,,,,
,4978,The Food Was Good But Below Our Expectations. It Was Not A Particularly Busy Night Yet We Had To Make Considerable Effort To Catch The Waiter's Attention When Required.,,,,,
,4979,The Waitress In Our Private Dining Room Was Lovely  I Didn't Get Her Name But She Was Funny  Personable And Discreet. ,,,,,
,4983,The Food Was Fantastic As Was The Breakfast The Next Day With Great Service All Round,,,,,
,4986,The Deco Of The Place Is Not Edwardian Npr Restaurant Like  Its More Like An Event Room But With The Great Customer Service From The Edwardian Staff And The Quality Of The Food Its Not An Issue At All! ,,,,,
,4996,Would Have Liked A Lot More Choice With Regard To The Bistro Menu. Barbara Was A Very Welcoming Host.,,,,,
,4999,No,,,,,
,5009,Lovely Friendly Staff...Couldn't Do Enough For You!,,,,,
,5014,Dessert Was Very Average  However French Fries Were Delicious!,,,,,
,5015,I Did Not Like The Design Of The Castle Bistro At All  Too Modern  Totally Out Of Keeping With The Hotel And The Whole Experience. As A Result We Skipped Lunch And Opted For Afternoon Tea In Front Of The Fire In The Library.,,,,,
,5016,The Portions Were Quite Small And My Husbands Fish Was Over Cooked  But Overall We Were Very Happy,,,,,
,5018,The Bistro Menu Was Very Limited  As I Personally Have A Problem With Too Much Oil And Citric Acid.   This Meant That I Continually Had An Upset Stomach.  We Would Also Prefer Large Chips As They Do Not Have So Much Oil.   I Suppose That I Should Have Realised This As It Is A Bistro  But I Have Not Been To One Before.   I Think That Should Be A Bit More Choice.,,,,,
,5019,No,,,,,
,5021,Bistro Was Very Good - Home Made Burger ?,,,,,
,5022,The Remarks In Answer To 15 Relate To The Edwardian Grill Only.  The Food In The Bistro Was Dreadful,,,,,
,5024,Brilliant,,,,,
,5025,Fantastic ,,,,,
,5026,The Service Was Quite Slow.   Otherwise Ok.    Did Not Like That They Did Not Have Any Special Children's Menu On Christmas Day At The Edwardian Other Than Regular Menu Despite The Steep Rate (Half Of Adult) And Not Only That They Did Not Have Bananas For The Banana Split That Was On The Children's Desert Menu. ,,,,,
,5030,Excellent,,,,,
,5031,The Grill Area Detracted From The Dining Experience,,,,,
,5036,The Food And Wine Was Not Good Value For Money. A Little Disappointed By The Grill  Especially The Oyster Dish. Seafood In General Is Not Very Good.,,,,,
,5037,The Setting Was Perfect  But The Food 'Lacked A Little Something '..Could Really Do With Upping The Game Slightly. Would Have Been Nice To Have Had Some 'Green Vegetables' With The Sirloin And Potato..,,,,,
,5041,This Is The Weak Area.,,,,,
,5044,Service And Food In Bistro Was Excellent And Very Good Value  Although Ambience Was Average And Seats Were Uncomfortable. Service In Edwardian Grill Was Slow And Not Very Attentive But Food Was Superb . Breakfasts Were First Class.,,,,,
,5048,Your Food Is Fine  In Keeping With The Hotel,,,,,
,5053,We Had Xmas Lunch With You. Having Eaten At Bovey Castle On Many Occasions We Looked Forward With Much Anticipation. £ 75 Each Was A  Lot But We Thought It Would Be Very Special. In Fact It Was Very Disappointing And Very Poor Value For Money. There Was Nothing Special About The Food The Beef Was Overdone In Some Cases. We Had To Ask As Did Other Tables For The Horseradish. There Was Very Little Additions With The Turkey Such As Bread Sauce Or Cranberry Jelly. The Puddings Lacked Anything Special And No Cream  Brandy Butter For Example With The Xmas Pudding. I Am Still Unsure Why 1 Waitress Wore What Seemed To Be A Sombrero It Just Made Us Feel Little Valued,,,,,
,5055,We Found Thegala Dinner Somewhat Overwhelming. Our First Plate Of Food Arrived One Hour And Ten Minutes After Sitting At Table. By The Time The Meat Course Arrived We Felt Overfed And Decided Not To Partake Of That Course. Wine Is Meant To Accompany Food  Not Preceed It As Happened On That Occasion. It Was Unfortunate  But Please Take Into Consideration That We Were An Aged Party And Therefore Not Used To Large Meals.Apart From That It Was A Magnificent  Generous And Very Well Planned Occasion. Thank You.,,,,,
,5066,A Clear Indication Of The Extra Cost Of Dining In The Edwardian Grill Would Have Been Helpful And Probably Would Have Given Us A Better Experience.,,,,,
,5068,Would Love To See Tooth Picks On Tables.,,,,,
,5069,Children's Pasta Tiny!,,,,,
,5071,Ensure Food And Drink Is Available For The Volume Of Guests In The Party,,,,,
,5072,In 3 Nights Stay Couldn't Get A Slot Between 7&8 Which Meant I Couldn't Dine In The Restaurant With My 10 Year Old This Could Put Me Off Returning As It Spoilt The Stay ,,,,,
,5073,Coffee Was Slightly Odd,,,,,
,5074,Very Nice,,,,,
,5075,The Bistro Was Good And The Food Very Good  But The.Choice In The Edwardian Dining Room Was Too Way Out For Our Taste However The Velouté And The Chicken Was Good. The Waiters At Dinner Did Not Look Happy.,,,,,
,5083,On Arrival (Of Our First Day) The Cafe Bistro Was Incredibly Busy For Lunch. We Waited Nearly An Hour Before We Ate. The Staff Were Incredibly Apologetic - And Could Not Be Faulted However. A Second Dining Area/Option Might Have Worked With Such Huge Demand? Our Next Experience Of Lunch Went Very Well - And Again  The Waiting Staff Were Charming And Extremely Efficient.,,,,,
,5089,Excellent,,,,,
,5094,I Loved The Dining Room Decorations On New Year's Eve. It Looked Really Lovely.,,,,,
,5095,As Mentioned Earlier In This Survey The Coffee Is Very Strong. Steak Arrived Undercooked Even Though We Had Requested Medium To Well Done. Chips Although Tasty And Crisp Were Very Oily. Would Have Like To Have The Choice Of A Whole Fresh Fish Rather Than Segments Of A Fillet Of Fish At Dinner And More Green Vegetables On Offer.,,,,,
,5098,Great Food Now Trying To Lose Weight,,,,,
,5100,Guest Must Be Advised Inadvance If The Edwardian Gril Room Is Not Avilable Because Of Private Function,,,,,
,5104,No,,,,,
,5106,The Main Dining Room Was Excellent  It Could Not Be Faulted But The Bistro On Our First Lunch Had Extremely Slow Service  So Far As To Say We Had To Leave Before Eating.  I Am Sure This Was Only Due To To The Volume Of Guests Arriving At The Same Time.,,,,,
,5112,Have To Admit That The Room Service Was Poor Quality And Not Good Value For Money. Wouldn't Repeat That. The Only Time I Have Ever Know The Kids To Turn Their Noses Up At Burger And Pizza - We Threw An Entire Pizza Away - Disappointing. Edwardian Grill Was Fantastic - My Husband Had A Great Birthday Meal And The Children Were Well Catered For And Very Welcome.,,,,,
,5115,Getting Better All The Time ,,,,,
,5120,Staff Were Too "Familiar"  A Bit Slack  Music Too Loud  General Service Poor And It Felt Like I Was In A Cafe Not In Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,5122,Lovely Waiters Good Wine Selection And Varied Menu And Excellent Breakfast,,,,,
,5123,Quality Of Food Was Good Considering The Number Of Guests Being Catered For Simultaneously. New Years Eve Gala Dinner Food Quality Deteriorated As Courses Progressed - Pasta Had Dried Out (Under Hot Plate?) And Duck Was Very Tough & Chewy,,,,,
,5124,The Edwardian Grill Is Still Not A Great Standard. It Is Top Prices And Mediocre Quality At Best. This Is Our 3Rd Trip And Still The Only Aspect Of The Hotel Which We Think Is Sub Standard. We Had To Wait A Long Time For The Good And Mine Had To Go Back Because It Was Flat Cold (Irrespective Of The Quality!) The Bistro Has Improved A Lot. All The Staff Are Great,,,,,
,5125,We Had Drinks In The Oak Bar Which Turned Out To Be Really Expensive ....That Is My Only Negative Comment About Our Stay! ,,,,,
,5126,Dinner Was Ok In The Bistro And Service Good - My Steak With Cafe De Paris Butter Was Very Salty Though. Good Sized Portion Of Prawns & Crayfish Starter. Overall It Was Fine  Nothing More.,,,,,
,5127,For A Restaurant That Appears To Pride Itself On Steak  Mine Was Poorly Cooked And Very Bland In Taste. ,,,,,
,5129,Defined Children Times Might Be A Good Idea In School Holidays.,,,,,
,5131,Another Time We Would Choose The Grill In Winter  As The Lower Ceiling In The Bistro Tends To Emphasize Noisey Children. Not Much That You Can Do About That If The Parents Dont Keep Them Quiet.,,,,,
,5134,Excellent  I Will Recommend It. Your Personnel Are Very Efficient And Dishes Were Simply Extraordinary  Comments About Edwardian. About The Bistro  Very Friendly And Easy Going People  We Attended With Four Children  It Was Very Easy To Get Everyone Happy. All Of Us Enjoyed!,,,,,
,5135,Better Than We Remembered  Staff Again Attentive Unless Busy. So Not Ok To Chide Someone For Pouring Your Own Wine When You Have Waited With An Empty Glass For Ten Minutes.,,,,,
,5138,All Was Magnificent Except Breakfast Buffet Was Cold.,,,,,
,5139,We Would Have Dined On Our Second Night In The Edwardian Grill  So Cannot Comment On It ...Yet.,,,,,
,5140,Edwardian Grill Needs A Bit Tasteful Decoration  The Castle Bistro Looks More Like A Centre Parks Bistro. Unfortunately.,,,,,
,5141,I Enjoyed The Meal Presented Well. Service Was Also Brilliant,,,,,
,5143,This Is Only My Opinion But Worth Thinking About. To Deliver Dishes At The Cost That They Are  I Didn't Feel Like It Was Over Priced But What I Did Feel Is That It Wasn't Good Value For Money. To Overcome My Opinion I Think All I Would Of Asked For Was A Few Priced In Extras. Such As A Nibble On The Table Maybe When We Arrived. Then To Have The Bread After. And Maybe A Palate Cleanser Before The Dessert. ,,,,,
,5145,We Had Delicious Meals In Both The Bistro  Where I Has The Nicest Fish And Chips I've Ever Had  And In The Edwardian Grill Where My Husband Had The Nicest Venison He's Ever Had! ,,,,,
,5146,Like You Got The Choice Of Where To Dine,,,,,
,5149,Rather Expensive!  Especially The Drinks.,,,,,
,5150,One Or Two Quality Ciders On Offer Would Have Been Nice. Your Bottled Ciders Were Awful.,,,,,
,5151,Much Better Chef Than Last Visit,,,,,
,5156,See Earlier Comment Re Portions And Dessert Choice,,,,,
,5157,Cold Desserts Should Be On Cold Plates Or The Cream Melts!,,,,,
,5158,We Noticed That The Food Was Much Better This Time Around Than The Last Time We Came The Menu Was A Little Bit More Cutting Edge. ,,,,,
,5159,The Service In The Bistro Was A Little Slow  But The Food Was Good. The Edwardian Grill Was Perfect In All Respects (Apart From The Child Shouting While Playing On The Rocking Horse At 7.30Pm Right Outside The Restaurant Doors! Perhaps Not The Best Place For It??),,,,,
,5161, I Feel The Bistro Could Be Improved And This Has Lowered Our Rating Of The Whole Experience.  Here Are Some Examples: Our Daughter Was Not Offered The Cordial From The Children's Menu.  We Were Not Aware It Was Included Until The End Of The Meal. When We Finished Our Main Course  We Waited Over 20 Mins For Someone To Ask Us If We Want A Dessert Or Some Drinks.  In The End We Left Without Having A Dessert Or Tea/Coffee The Couple On The Next Table Complained That They Had Found Soil In There Salad! ,,,,,
,5162,Had To Wait A While For The Coffee At Breakfast & Ask Twice ,,,,,
,5163,The Food In The Bistro Was Good But It Felt More Basic Because Of The Decor Which Didn't Fit In With The Rest Of The Building. A Tablecloth Would Help Especially In The Evenings.,,,,,
,5167,I Felt The Main Course Of Mushroom Cannelloni Could Have Been A Little More Generous. Breakfast Was Excellent And Made More Enjoyable By  Excellent Service And Attention..,,,,,
,5168,Although Arriving For Pre-Drinks We Were Welcomed Wholeheartedly And The Venue Was Beautiful  We Both Felt The Food Didn't Match The Price Tag And The Service From Sitting Down To Dine Was A Bit Hit Or Miss.   ,,,,,
,5169,The Chef Needs To Learn What Can Be Eaten On A Strict Gluten Free Diet.  Had I Eaten The Chips I Would Have Been I'll For The Following G Two Days Also Salad Needs To Be Washed More Thoroughly Other Than This To Food Was Delicious,,,,,
,5171,One Meal Was Returned Due To The Fact Of Being Severely Over Cooked.  We Were Offered A Replacement But Had Lost Interest In Eating.  We Felt That Having Over Cooked The Meal The Chef Should Not Have Been Willing To Offer It To Us As A Satisfactory Meal.,,,,,
,5174,Bistro Decor A Bit Basic And Didn't Seem To Fit In Overall Style Of Rest Of Hotel. A Tablecloth Would Be Nice.,,,,,
,5175,It Would Have Been Useful To Know About The Service Charge Before Receiving The Bill At Checkout.,,,,,
,5176,Delicious Food  Attentive Staff And Lovely Dining Room,,,,,
,5178,The Bistro Had Run Out Of A Lot Of Things But Was Not Informed Until We Ordered And The Food Was Not Very Good.I Had To Return My Meal As It Was Cold And The Chips Were Tasted As If They Were Reheated. We Will Try The Edwardian Grill On Sunday Evening When We Stay As We Have Had Good Meals In There Before.,,,,,
,5180,Something Not Right About Staffing.....Appeared To Not Be Able To Cope With Demand ,,,,,
,5181,Disappointing Bistro Menu And Quality. Good Service Though Excellent Service And Quality In The Edwardian Grill Far Outweighs The Bistro Short- Comings Fortunately.,,,,,
,5191,The Quality Of The Service In The Castle Bistro At Breakfast  Was Poor. The Waiter Took Our Order  And While Waiting We Had Cereal.We Were Then Left For About Half An Hour And Our Table Was Not Cleared. In The Meantime  Other Guest Had Arrived  Had Their Breakfast And Left. These Tables Were Also Not Cleared. Eventually I Had To Find A Waiter And Explain That We Had Been Waiting A Long Time. A Few Minutes Later Our Breakfast Finally Arrived And We Ate It Surrounded By Uncleared Tables. By Now Most Of The Other Guests Had Finished. No Apology Was Made. A Very Disappointing Experience. ,,,,,
,5193,I Wish We Had Eaten At The Edwardian Grill Instead. As It Was  Castle Bistro Was Very 'Business Hotel' In The Menu Choices. Afterwards We Went And Found The Edwardian Grill And Were Dazzled By It. I Wish We Had Known. Perhaps If A) My Wife Had Read The Correspondence Properly  Or B) We Had The Choice (Supplement To Be Paid) Explained To Us At Reception Then We Would Have Chosen It.,,,,,
,5196,Food In The Bistro Very Poor,,,,,
,5197,We Dined In The Bistro  There Was A Lovely Atmosphere  The Manageress Was Very Friendly And Helpful And The Food Was Excellent!,,,,,
,5199,On The First Morning The Fried Eggs Had Runny Whites  On The Second Morning I Asked For Them To Have Non Runny Whites  They Turned Up Runny  I Sent It Back To The Kitchen And It Came Out Even Runnier. I Left It And Refused To Pay The Service Charge.  The Steaks Were Like Boot Leather  It Was A Popular Topic Of Conversation In The Bar Amongst The Other Guests The Afternoon Champagne Tea Was Very Nice,,,,,
,5202,The Waiter Service Was Only Average For Such A High Class Establishment,,,,,
,5203,Had The Fish With Mushrooms Which Was A Little Over Salty And Would Have Benefitted With Something Like Mash To Balance It.  Beautiful Setting. Lightening Could Have Been A Little Softer. ,,,,,
,5205,The Food Was Delicious And The Service Was Great In The Edwardian  A Small Improvement Would Be For The Waiting Staff To Remind You Of What You Had Ordered E.G. Scallops With Xxx Vinaigrette Etc  The Service For Breakfast In The Castle Bistro Was Very Average But I Think That The Change Of Venue Was Causing Staff Issues. I Had To Wait Over 5 Minutes For A Cereal Bowl Having Asked 3 Times. I Also Heard The Chef Use The "F Word". The Breakfast Experience Didn't Spoil Or Sour The Weekend  It Was Just Nowhere Close To The High Bar Set In Other Areas Of The Hotel.  ,,,,,
,5206,Menu Was A Bit Limited,,,,,
,5208,Fantastic! ,,,,,
,5209,The Only Thing We Did Notice  Was That At Breakfast You No Longer Have The Hot Dishes At The Buffet For Self Service. Also There Were No Croissants Available.,,,,,
,5210,Service In The Grill Was Excellent But It Was Only Fair In The Bistro. ,,,,,
,5212,Very Knowledgeable Staff Re Wines And Cheeses Etc. Impressed That When We Asked For A Particular Table On Wednesday It Was Automatically Reserved For Us The Following Evening.,,,,,
,5214,The Food Was Lovely  Well Cooked And Good Presentation. Congratulations To The Chef. The Breakfast Service Was Not As Exemplary As In The Evening.,,,,,
,5218,Looked At Menu In The Grill Restaurant On Your Website We Did Not Think It Was Very Intersting  Decided To It At Gidleigh Park  For Lunch,,,,,
,5219,No,,,,,
,5222,Bistro Disn't Look Or Feel Like A Bistro...More Like A Cantwen...Not What I Expwcted. Food Presentation And Araff Knowledge Needs Improving To Match Prices.,,,,,
,5223,I Didn't Really Like The Castle Bistro As It Felt Out Of Keeping With The Rest Of The Building.,,,,,
,5224,Enjoyed The Lunch In Bistro And Dinner In Grill - Lovely Contrast Of Venues. And Although I Didn't Have It Myself - What A Cheeseboard! Staff Extremely Efficient.  Breakfast Was A Little Disappointing For Both Of Us  With The Hot Items In The Buffet Not Terribly Hot - Though I Did Notice That The Waitress Was Attentive To Keeping It Re-Stocked.,,,,,
,5225,The Service And Staff Were Excellent,,,,,
,5227,Having Eaten In Some Very High Standard Fine Dining Restaurants We Did Have High Expectations Of The Food  However  We Did Find That Although The Presentation Was Great The Taste And Quality Was A Disappointment. We Felt That A Lot Of The Flavours Didn't Compliment Each Other Which Was A Shame. ,,,,,
,5228,Again It Was Lovely But I Thought Expensive For What We Had. ,,,,,
,5229,Some Of The Best Food I Have Ever Eaten,,,,,
,5235,I Would Not Hesitiate To Recommend It To Others  A Truely Special Experience With A Dedicated Team Of Staff Who Were Most Attentive Without Being Intrusive.,,,,,
,5236,Would Have Liked A More Extensive Beef Menu  Not Just Steak. Morning Toast Could Be Artisan Bread. Otherwise  Everything Was Delicious And Excellent Quality.,,,,,
,5239,All The Tables Were Full But The Staff Made Us Feel Like We Were The Only People In Eating,,,,,
,5242,You Catered For My Gluten Allergy  Thankyou.,,,,,
,5243,Ordered A Medium T Bone Steak And Came Extremely Rare.  Dissapointing,,,,,
,5244,On The Friday Evening The Service Was Impeccable However  We Thought It Was Rather Slow At Sunday Lunch.,,,,,
,5245,Liked The Breakfast Arrangements: One Extended Breakfast Time.  Mixture Of Self Service And Silver Service Is A Strong Offer,,,,,
,5248,The Service On Friday Evening For The Two Of Us Was Perfect But For Sunday Lunch  When We Were Joined By 10 Members Of The Family It Was Quite Slow.,,,,,
,5250,The Edwardian Grill Room Is A Beautiful Room And The Use Of Candlelight In The Evening Creates A Good Atmosphere.,,,,,
,5252,My Dining Experience As All Other Experience At Bovey Castle Was Excellent With The Exception Of The Bistro.  I Only Dined There Once  But It Was Disappointing.  The Service Was Not Helpful Regarding Gluten Free Meals  There Was No Offer Of What I Could Have Or How It Could Be Adapted.  What I Ordered Was Satisfactory  But Limited Choice.  No One Here Asked If There Was Anything Else They Could Get Or Do For Me - As They Did In All Other Areas.  As A Result It Was A Functional Experience  Rather Than A Pleasurable One.  I Did Not Return For Another Experience.  The Room Was Also  Cold.,,,,,
,5257,Had The Christmas Meal Which Was Lovely But The Christmas Pudding Was A Bit Hard. I Did Comment About This And The Staff Were Very Kind In Offering Any Alternative. ,,,,,
,5259,Food Was Average But I Can Appreciate That The Castle Bistro Is Not The One To Go To For Fine Dinning ,,,,,
,5266,See First Comments.,,,,,
,5269,Breakfast Excellent. We Ate In The Edwardian Grill And Feel That For The Cost The Food Should Be Better. I Had A Tough Rump Steak Which Was Very Disappointing. I Am A Beef Farmer (Pedigree Ruby Red Cattle) And I Know How Good A Steak And Beef Should Be. Staff Generally Very Good. Dining Room Was Quiet When We Stayed And The Waiter Was Good But Slightly Over Attentive Which Made It Hard To Relax. ,,,,,
,5279,My Husbands Duck Was Slightly Chewy  Which He Just Mentioned To The Waitress. We Were Very Impressed Then That The Manager (Or Senior Staff) Came Over To Apologise. It Was Still Very Tasty!,,,,,
,5281,Breakfast Was My Favourite.
At Dinner We Had Steak  But No Steak Knives Which Made It Difficult To Eat.,,,,,
,5282,The Fine Dining Hall Should Be Used Only For Breakfast Or Large Party's Only  And Not For Fine Dining Evening Meals. There Are Other Smaller More Intimate Rooms That Could Be Converted Into Dining Rooms. Boveycastle Is Not Butlins! ,,,,,
,5283,A Bit Of A Wait For Dinner But It Was Worth It,,,,,
,5286,On Booking We Were Not Told That You Would Have To Pre-Book To Eat In The Edwardian Grill - This Oportunity Would Have Been Helpful.  The Bistro Was Like Another World And Not In Keeping With The High Standard Of Service And Attention To Detail Found In The Main Section Of The Castle  However The Food Was Fine. ,,,,,
,5287,Selection Of Puddings Was Very Limited Otherwise Food Was Excellent,,,,,
,5288,The Breakfast Was Really Excellent. ,,,,,
,5289,See Above Re- Reservations
Also £30 For A Bottle Of Modest Wine (+12.5%) A Bit Much,,,,,
,5297,Slightly Disappointed On The Lack Of Choice For Sweets. Especially As It Was My Birthday & Only Two Sweets Available  Of Nothing I Liked.,,,,,
,5301,Starters A Bit Expensive For What You Get. Interesting Choices Though And High Quality Presentation.,,,,,
,5303,We Were Impressed By Both The Edwardian Grill And The Castle Bistro  But Decided To Eat In The Grill For Our Special Occasion.  The Number Of Staff Who Attended Us Was Surprising  But Their Skill In Their Work Made It A Very Personal Experience.  Though The Grill Appears A Very Formal Room  They Managed To Make It Seem Quite Intimate Too.,,,,,
,5304,The Edwardian Grill Was Excellent But The Bistro Was Not As Good. The Bread We Received Was Stale And One Of The Staff Couldn't Speak English Well Enough To Be Understood.
We Felt The Music Was Too Loud. But We Didn't Ask To Turn It Down. ,,,,,
,5308,The Quality Of Food Was Excellent,,,,,
,5318,If You Offered Sushi Then We Would Be There Even More!  ,,,,,
,5319,We Both Thought The Food Was Top Quality Restaurant Food And Very Relaxed Env't,,,,,
,5322,No Sharp Knives Served With The Meat   We Had To Ask For Them 
Other Than That The Service Was Very Good ,,,,,
,5323,The Rating Above Is For The Bistro.  I Would Rate The Edwardian Grill As Good  Excellent And Good.
The Manager In The Edwardian Grill And The Oak Bar (Don't Now His Name But Had Sideburns And Was Italian I Believe) Was Excellent And The The Lady In The Black In The Bar Was Very Good.  Hate To Say It But There Felt Like There Was A Divide Of Staff - Good Ones In The Edwardian Grill And The Not So Good In The Castle Bistro. Food In Edwardian Would Have Been Marked Excellent Had It Not So Obviously Sat Under The Hot Plate For A While And Dried Up A Little.,,,,,
,5325,Lovely Ambience And A Reasonably Priced But Very Tasty Wine.,,,,,
,5327,My Excellent Rating Was In Relation To The Edwardian Grill - Excellent - The Bistro However Has Real Problems - Our First Night We Arrived But We Had To Wait For Our Friends To Join Us - We Were Put On A Table And Then Pretty Much Ignored - I Finally Got The Attention Of A Young Waitress Over And Asked Her For Some Wine  Water And Bread. She Disappeared And I Saw Her Doing Other Tasks - Another Slightly Older Waitress Then Came To Take Our Order 10 Mins Later - When I Said We Had Ordered I Was Told That Nothing Had Been Ordered And Then I Explained Who Had Taken The Order And I Was Told That She Was "Agency Staff And Did Not Know What To Do" 

In All The Environment Was Very Cold And Souless-On The Sundeay Night I Had A Burger - This Was Extremly Salty - And Again The Service Was Not Good - Staff Were More Intereseted In Talking Behind The Bar And Doing Other Tasks And Could Not Make Any Eye Contact-All In All The Food And Service Was A Disappointment In The Bistro - 

Grill Out Of This World   ,,,,,
,5328,The Above Scores Are Related To The Edwardian Grill Only  Which Really Was Excellent Especially For Two Guests Who Do Not Eat Meat. First Class.
The Castle Bistro Was Not Great And Almost Didn’T Seem Part Of Bovey! Overpriced  £26 For Two Cheese And Tomato Pizzas. Very Limited Menu Choice And A Confused Atmosphere  Not Sure The Bistro Knew What It Was Trying To Be?
,,,,,
,5329,Menu Diverse And Delicious. Catered Well For Children And Adults With Different Food Requirements.,,,,,
,5333,The Food At The Edwardian Grill Was Not Up To The Standard Of The Rest Of The Hotel. We Wished We Had  And In Future Will  Eat At The Bistro Which Was Really Nice. The Grill Was Ok But Not Worth The Money  The Steak Was Over Cooked  Overall It Did Not Measure Up To London Restaurants Of The Same Cost. I Was Disappointed That My Food Allergy Had Not Been Logged  When I Rang Up To Make The Booking Before Our Visit I Was Asked About Food Allergies And I Explained My Dairy Intolerance. I Expected Not To Have To Mention This Again And That When We Were Seated The Staff Would Know. This Is The Level Of Service I Have Received At Other Hotels And Restaurants. Instead I Had To Explain And I Asked For A Tomato Based Sauce Rather Than Bearnaise With My Steak. When It Came I Had The Bearnaise Sauce And When I Asked Again I Was Bought Tomato Ketchup. This Wasn't What I Had Expected In A High Class Restaurant! I Didn't Mind Explaining To The Waiter  I Just Don't Understand Why I Was Asked When I Booked The Table If It Wasn't Logged. ,,,,,
,5334,Beautiful Food  Attractive Menus. Was Some Discrepancy In Portion Size But This Was Not A Problem To Me. I Had A Halibut & It Was Small With No Additional Potato & Veg. It Came With Some Trompettes  A Small Garnish Of Fried Bread And Eggs & 3 Small Leeks -  It Looked Tiny Compared To My Husbands Steak That Had Several Sides (Mushroom  Chips  Watercress  Green Beans & Sauce). This Was Not A Problem To Me As I Do Not Have A Big Appetite But I Could Imagine Others Could Be Frustrated By This & May Have Expected Sides Too. ,,,,,
,5337,The Dining Was Very Impressive. Also I'd Like To Add That Whilst Relaxing In One Of The Lounges A Lady Called Maria Looked After Us And Was Very Helpful & Friendly  A Credit To You! ,,,,,
,5338,Food Was Very Enjoyable And Excellent Quality  Though The Puddings In The Bistro Were The Exception To This  Quite Average At This Point.,,,,,
,5344,No,,,,,
,5349,I D0 Feel That If You Wish The Lodge Visitors To Make Use Of The Dinning Facilities In The Hotel  A Sample Menu In The Loge  Visible Or At The Check In When Guests Arrive.  The Lodge Book Does Not Show Off Enough Of The Food.,,,,,
,5350,No  Other Than The Breakfast Was Fantastic!,,,,,
,5352,More Vegetarian Options,,,,,
,5353,Excellent Service & Delicious Local Produce Made For Memorable Dinning Experiences.,,,,,
,5354,Excellent Choice Of Wine. ,,,,,
,5355,As This Was An Offer We Were Giving A Written Note Saying That We Were Dining In The Bistro. We Dined In The Edwardian Grill On Our Second Night Which We Preferred.  The Bistro Is Ideal For A Family With Children  But We Felt That The Edwardian Grill Was More To Our Liking.,,,,,
,5356,No All Perfect,,,,,
,5358,No,,,,,
,5361,The Food In The Evening Was Outstanding And The Service Great. ,,,,,
,5364,Sunday Lunch Was Excellent Value.  Restaurant Was Very Accommodating After I Had Eaten One Of The Two Vegetarian Meals  And I'd Not Fancy The Other.  I Was Offered An Alternative Which Was Appreciated.,,,,,
,5366,Rosemary Roll Was Far Too Salty I Couldn't Eat It  Everything Else Was Perfect,,,,,
,5371,The Price Of The Starters Were A Little Step For What You Got.,,,,,
,5372,I Really Appreciate Room Being Found For Us In The Edwardian Grill - Exquisite Food! ,,,,,
,5373,Please Remove The Mirrors. It Will Be Better Without Them. In Fact It Gives You A Feeling Of A Ferry Boat. There Was A Bit Too Much Smell From The Kitchen In The Dining Hall. I Would Advise That You Turn The Table For Two 90 Degrees So That The One Person Has Not Have To Stear Into The Wall All Evening  And Have The Rest Of The Room Behind You. Staff In The Dining Hall Was Very Attentive.,,,,,
,5374,We Were Not Offered The Choice Of The Edwardian Grill And Assume It Was Closed As The Hotel Was Quiet  But Not Impressed At All With The Castle Bistro For An Evening Meal - Starter Okay  But Main Course And Pudding Were Awful And Generally The Menu Was Very Unappealing. I Am Unlikely To Visit Again As A Consequence.,,,,,
,5376,We Felt That The Design Of The Bistro Was Not In Keeping With The Splendour Of The Hotel. It Felt Quite Exposed In The Evening Especially With Such Awfull Weather Battering Against The Undressed  Windows  Rather Like A Conservatory  No Soft Furnishings Etc. However This Is A Personal Taste And Certainly Did Not Affect Our Enjoyment Of The Meal.,,,,,
,5377,The Rather Limited Evening Menu  And Not Enough Plainer Food  If We Had Been There For A Week We Would've Struggled To Find Something On The Menu Every Night. ,,,,,
,5382,We Really Enjoyed Dining In The Smaller Part Of The Edwardian Restaurant ,,,,,
,5383,Excellent Except: As Mentioned To Barbara And Federico The Bistro Pizza Base Was Just Poor - Too Thick And Uncooked..Like Soft Unccoked Dough. The Replacement After Complaining Was No Better - We Were Not Charged So We Are Not Unhappy - Just Expected Better. Dinner In The Eg Was Superb..The Vennison And Duck Perfecty Succulent. Made Mistake Of Ordering Red Wine By Glass (For Variety) And It Was Not Well Looked After - Lacked Freshness. Cheese Choice Was Wonderful And Young Hungarian Lady Was Just Charming! Breakfast Was Splendid! ,,,,,
,5385,Menu Was Not Too Appealing

Lunch In The Oak Bar Was Very Poor

Wines Were Overpriced,,,,,
,5386,Very Expensive In Edwardian Grill ,,,,,
,5387,You Offer Everything  Formal  Informal  Fireside  Excellent Options.,,,,,
,5388,Bistro Menu Was A Little Restricted. Edwardian Grill Served Excellent Food But Was A Little Expensive.,,,,,
,5389,Really Enjoyed The Whole Dining Experience,,,,,
,5392,None,,,,,
,5396,Food Was Well Presented And Tasted Wonderful   I Think Being Served By Six Different People Is Excessive Because They Can't Keep Track Of Bread Rolls Being Given  Glasses Topped Up And Whether Anyone Has Asked If All Is Well.,,,,,
,5399,This Is The Second Time I Have Dined At The Bistro - Previously Had Lunch On A Spa Day.  The Menu Did Not Seem To Vary Much From My Previous Visit - Fortunately My Companions Had Not Visited Before So It Was All New To Them,,,,,
,5402,Our Dinner Was Terrible.Chef Was Away !,,,,,
,5404,Edwardian Restaurant Was Excellent.  I Would Comment That All The Starter Options Were "Fussy" And Simpler Options Were Not In Evidence.
Bistro Was Adequate - Service Was Good But Food Was Disappointing For The Venue.,,,,,
,5405,There Was A Problem In Translation Regarding Order But Was Rectified Promptly .,,,,,
,5411,We Both Opted For Fish As A Main Course And Both Were Disappointing.,,,,,
,5413,Dining Room Staff Were Very Knowledgeable About The Food On Offer And Were Not Afraid To Offer Suggestions And Opinions To Help Us Decide On The Choice Of Food And Wine,,,,,
,5415,The Food Was Exceptionally Tasty.,,,,,
,5416,No,,,,,
,5417,Much Nicer Eating In The Main Grill Instead Of The Smaller Room When There Are Smaller Numbers Of People.,,,,,
,5418,Disappointed That The Bistro Menu Was The Same All Day Each Day. I Dont Eat Pizza So Choices Were Quite Limited,,,,,
,5419,Just The Drinks Mentioned Previously.,,,,,
,5420,Yes  Your Waiter In The Edwardian Grill Needs A Refresher Course In Customer Service.,,,,,
,5423,The Food Was Served With Calmness  Style And Good Attention To Detail.,,,,,
,5424,Very Pleasant And Beautifully Presented,,,,,
,5425,Please Can You Tell Me Who Your Meat Supplier Is? Best Rib-Eye I Have Ever Had And That Includes The Restaurants I Have Eaten At In The Us! ,,,,,
,5426,Loved The Edwardian Grill Will Try The Bistro Next Time We Stay,,,,,
,5428,We Particularly Enjoyed The Cocktails And Service In The Bar Prior To Dining.
Re: Breakfast: I Would Have Preferred Vegetarian Sausages To Be Offered As Part Of The Breakfast Buffet To Allow Vegetarians To Access The Choice Offered To Non-Vegetarians Rather Than Having To Order A Vegetarian Cooked Breakfast From The A La Carte Menu.,,,,,
,5429,The Food And Staff Were Excellent As Always! Can't Wait To Come Back For This. ,,,,,
,5430,Very Pleased To See That The Menu Now Has Greater Choice - Important To Have More Variety When Dining On More Than One Night. ,,,,,
,5433,Very Good. The Edwardian Grill Food Was Very Tasty. We Had St Valentine's Special Menu And It Was Delicious...Maybe One Suggestion For The Future - To Keep One Desert On The Special Menu. In Our Case  We Had 2 Plus Cofee With Sweets  Which Were Tasty  But We Both Struggled To Eat It All And Were Very Stuffed At The End Of The Dinner. Perhaps 2 Deserts Is A Little Too Much And It's Hard To Trully Appreciate The Flavours.,,,,,

,Total Responses:,67,,,,,
,Not Answered:,0,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,
,218,Its Isolation Is A Bonus - Our Group Kept Focus And Bonded More As A Result.,,,,,
,300,The Internet Code/Set Up Was Appreciated But Not Easy To Set Up  So We Had To Write Our Own Instructions For Our Guests.,,,,,
,301,I Did Not Do Any Business During Our Stay And Did Not Log Onto The Internet  However Mobile Phone Reception Is Really Quite Difficult - Impossible From The Lodges And Some Parts Of The Main Hotel But Ok From The South Terrace,,,,,
,346,Excellent  But I Wouldn't Advise Staying An Overnight Stay  Which Is A Pity As My First Impressions Were So High That I Was Going To Strongly Recommend To The Partners Of Clare House Surgery That We Have Our Away-Weekend At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,412,The Internet In The Business Meeting Room Is Operating Normally  And We Can Access Our Company Via Vpn Network Connection With No Problem.  (We Only Have Problem In The Hotel Guest Room Internet Via Wifi Ports There).,,,,,
,540,The Conference Room Was A Bit Of A Squeeze For All Of Us And The Coffee Ran Out So I Missed Out. Otherwise Everything Was Organised Without A Hitch.,,,,,
,558,None,,,,,
,603,Yes  I Think In This Day And Age Internet Should Be Provided For Free,,,,,
,687,Not Sure Whether It Was Our Fault Or Yours But Slides Projected Were Poor Quality,,,,,
,692,The Facilities Were Good  Save For The Projector For Powerpoint Meant The Slides Were Very Poor.,,,,,
,694,Our Lunch Was Very Late On The Second Day  Even Though You Had The Timings.,,,,,
,700,You Need A Relay For Mobile Signal.  Biggest Single Drawback.,,,,,
,730,The Conference Suite Was Crowded For The Number Of Delegates.  The Temperature Was Cold And The Projector Was Not Sharp - Consequently A Number Of Slides Did Not Display Correctly.,,,,,
,781,Poor Mobile Phone Signal - But I Don't Suppose There Is Much That Can Be Done About That!,,,,,
,877,The Sound For The Laptop When Plugged In Did Not Work,,,,,
,981,Mobile Phone Coverage Was Poor,,,,,
,1041,Unfortunately  There Was A Power Cut In The Suite We Were Supposed To Use.   However  We Were Rehomed In The Library Which Was A Lovely Room And Served Our Purposes Well.   I Am Not Sure About The Av Equipment Or The Internet As Our Network Manager Took Care Of Things And I'm Not Sure What He Provided Or What The Hotel Provided.,,,,,
,1101,The Library Was Used Due To A Power Failure In The Chosen Business Venue,,,,,
,1154,Telephony And Internet Reception Have Improved From A Year Ago  But Are Still Too Erratic And Unreliable.,,,,,
,1185,I Would Hesitate To Recommend It.,,,,,
,1281,Excellent!,,,,,
,1384,Very Poor Quality Projection Screen- Quite Important For A Successful Meeting In The Multimedia Age,,,,,
,1424,Meeting Room Was Cold And We Lost 30 Mins Waiting For Flipcharts Etc... Not Well Organised.. And Then  Through The Day More Heaters Were Brought Into The Room Until Such Point It Was Roasting No Happy Medium,,,,,
,1565,We Ended Up In The Library Due To Technical Problems. It Proved Perfect For Our Needs Being A Small Group. At Times The Smoke From The Neighbouring Lounge Was Distracting And Made It Difficult To See.,,,,,
,1592,It Too A Good Couple Of Hours To Get A Picture On The Presentation Screen So Rehearsal Time Was Greatly Reduced But I Think This Was A One-Off Niggle Rather Than A Recurring Problem.  Espite This  Our Agm Concluded As A Great Success  Due In Large Part To The Facilities And Support Of Bovey Castle Staff.,,,,,
,1593,Phone Reception Very Poor So Not Ideal For Business Users,,,,,
,1733,Only Huge Pens Were Available Next To The Flip Charts,,,,,
,1818,Lack Of Seats Was A Problem And Several Of Us Had To Send Or Sit On A Table. It Was A 3 Hour Course So A Little Uncomfortable.,,,,,
,1901,A Lovely Setting Where We Were Looked After Well By All Your Staff.  Thank You,,,,,
,1993,A Stronger Wi-Fi Is Needed,,,,,
,2025,Meeting Room Was A Bit Chilly On Arrival  The Stairs To The Room Were Very Steep And Quite Slippery After It Rained,,,,,
,2107,Only Issue Is The Internet Access,,,,,
,2200,2Min 20 Sec Call To A Mobile = Â£4.50 That Is A Lot!,,,,,
,2205,Excellent Venue To Hold Our Prodcut Launch Event Which Was A Factor In Its Huge Success.  Well Done All The Team At Bovey!,,,,,
,2318,The Proper Venue Was Not Available Due To A Power Problem. We Were Given The Library As An Alternative Which Was Informal  But Very Nice To Work In. Again  The Staff Were Outstanding.,,,,,
,2357,Lack Of Mobile Phone Signal,,,,,
,2388,Room Was A Bit Crowded For 10 People Access To The Lunch In The Room Was Difficult - Only One Person Could Access The Food At A Time Due To Space Constraints And Layout In The Corner,,,,,
,2524,Craig And Polly Were Fantastic At Helping Me Get The Av Equipment Up And Running And Talking Me Through How Things Work.  The Team Also Bought Up Extra Flip Charts As Requested And The Breakfast / Refreshments & Working Lunches Were Fabulous.  The Meeting Room Was Great And Important To Have Natural Daylight And The Venue Does Work Well For Us.,,,,,
,2830,The Library Is A Splendid Room And We Were Well Looked After.,,,,,
,2959,Brilliant For A Business Xmas Party Do,,,,,
,3784,The Projector Was A Bit Fuzzy  Maybe Figure Out How To Sharpen The Resolution?  (Dartmoor Suite),,,,,
,4003,I Work For A Company Who Will Be Using Bovey Castle For Our Company Day In June. I Was Checking Out The Facilities And The Grounds For The Daytime And Evening Entertainment. We Have Lots Of Rooms For Our Sole Use On That Day And Have Been Told That All Furniture Can Be Removed To Suit Our Requirements.,,,,,
,4030,Need To Improve Telephone Reception And Internet Dropped In And Out,,,,,
,4037,Needed A Lot More Coffee Served. One Small Flask Was Never Going To Serve 30 People.,,,,,
,4044,It Would Be Good To Clarify Up Front That The Same Room Could Be Used Over Duration Of The Stay And That Materials Could Be Left Safely In The Room Overnight.,,,,,
,4155,We Didn't Use The Business Facitilites So No Comment.,,,,,
,4164,Great For The Incentive Market!,,,,,
,4210,Excellent And Well Looked After By All Staff,,,,,
,4225,No,,,,,
,4237,It Is A Big Problem For Business That You Cannot Get A Phone Signal Easily.  These Days With Smart Phones And Ipads  A Mobile Connection Is Essential.,,,,,
,4241,Ridiculously Off The Beaten Track. A Delightful Retreat  But Not Conducive To Business Planning. This Is An Unfair Comparison  As It's Akin To Complaining About Rain In The Lake District  But As A Strict Business Venue  Then It Isn't For Me.,,,,,
,4298,Although Deemed Business  It Was In Fact Our Xmas Party  So None Of The Facilities Were Experienced,,,,,
,4324,We Were Looking For A Venue To Host A Conference In October And Was Impressed With What We Saw But Do Feel The Restaurants Let The Bovey Castle Down.,,,,,
,4382,I Am Unable To Answer These Questions As It Was My Husband That Used The Business Facility. I Am Sure Other Guests In Our Party Will Answer Them For You.  My Husband Did Comment That Coffee Was Cold And Did Not Arrive When Requested.,,,,,
,4393,Very Well Suited,,,,,
,4454,Excellent,,,,,
,4510,To Have To Pay For Wifi In A Hotel In This Price Bracket Is Very Poor,,,,,
,4511,No,,,,,
,4520,Wireless Internet Connection Was Very Poor.,,,,,
,4557,The Lack Of A Signal For Mobile Phones Was A Bit Of An Issue As We Are A 24 Hour Business.,,,,,
,4610,No,,,,,
,4747,Poor Internet And Mobile Phone Access,,,,,
,4821,We Were In The Room In The Annexe - Which Became Very Warm And Stuffy- Perhaps Due To The Unseasonally Warm Weather! And Probably Too Many People With It Equipment In One Room,,,,,
,4889,No,,,,,
,5016,Lovely,,,,,
,5252,A Fabulous Place  And A Wonderful Setting.  Fabulous Food With The Exception Of The Bistro.  Great Staff.,,,,,
,5365,I Did Not Use It For A Business Venue - I Was On My Way To A Business Meeting Locally.  However The Fact That I Could Not Get Any Mobile Phone Connection Would Put Me Off If I Were To Consider Using It As A Business Venue.,,,,,

,7,The Room In Which I Had My Massage Was A Little Too Cool For My Liking  And I Could Have Been Wrapped Up More In Order That I Stayed Nice And Toasty!,,,,,
,11,I Had A Swim And Absolutely Love The Pool!  Always Have!,,,,,
,15,Relaxation Room Was Not As Relaxing As Others. Slightly Old Fashioned In Concept But Perhaps This Was Intentional.,,,,,
,26,The Gym And Pool Area And Changing Rooms Were Not The High Standard We Expected As Members Of Chewton Glen Spa.  Needs Decorating And Ladies Changing Room Like A School Changing Room.  Gym Machines Good But Far Too Crowded And No Free Weights. No Free Water Or Towels.,,,,,
,27,I Didn't Use The Spa Itself But Used The Swimming Pool  Sauna And Steam.  It Was Lovely To Come Back From A Tiring Day And Relax Apart From The Noisy Children And Even Noisier Parents Who Stayed Past 5.30Pm When It Should Have Been Adults Only.  Can I Suggest A Member Of Staff Goes Down At 5.30Pm To Make Sure All Children Are Out.  I Didn't Feel I Could Say Anything And Didn't Want To Get Into An Argument When I Was Supposed To Be Relaxing.  It's Not Fair To Put Your Guests In This Position  Staff Should Tell Them To Get Out.,,,,,
,29,The Pool Was Fantastic  I Have Only Marked The Other Boxes As '2' As I Felt The Changing Rooms Were A Little Too Communal With No Privacy.  Also There Were No Lockers Which Was Disappointing.  The Spa Pool  Being Part Of The Pool  Wasn't As Good Or As Warm As Others I Have Tried.  However  I Hasten To Add That I Am Being Hypercritical As Everything Else Was So Perfect!  I Also Am Slightly Spoilt As I Regularly Visit The Carey's Manor Spa Which Is An Unfair Benchmark To Try To Meet!,,,,,
,30,Excellent,,,,,
,32,Beautiful Pool,,,,,
,33,The Treatment Was Good. Spa Decor A Little Outdated And Dark.,,,,,
,36,It Was Lovely And Relaxing - Would Not Describe It As Exceptional Due To General Wear And Tear Especially The Changing Facilities.,,,,,
,45,It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Trial Access To The Spa For Guest Staying. I Would Have Liked To Look Around. Treatments Were Very Expensive.,,,,,
,48,I Had A Massage Which Was Lovely And Having Had A Lot Of Massages In The Past  It Was One Of My Better Ones.  The One Thing That  Sadly Let It Down Though  And Im Sure It Couldnt Have Really Been Helped Was That I Was Trying The Totally Relax But They Were Cutting The Grass Right Outside The Window With A Rather Noisy Strimmer Which Was Rather Annoying.  The Therapist Did Turn The Music Up But You Could Still Hear It And She Did Apologise At The End.  I Appreciate The Grass Needs Cutting  I Was Just Unlucky!,,,,,
,50,Staff Were Very Helpful In Getting More Therapists In - But If More Treatment Times Had Been Available We Would Have Used Them.,,,,,
,56,Pool Was Great And Perfect Temperature. Kids Loved It!,,,,,
,61,We Only Used The Pool.  It Was Very Nice For The Children.,,,,,
,63,Gym Equipment A Bit Dated.,,,,,
,68,Overall The Spa Area Is What I Would Expect.  There Are Areas That I Notice Purely Because Of The Business I Am In - Mastic Joints On Tiling Perimeters Within The Shower Areas Were Poorly Done.  The Changing Areas Were Kept Clean And Tidy But The Ladies Area Did Run Out Of Water On One Occasion.  The Sauna Was Generally Clean The The Floor Tiles Were A Little Uncleaned In Areas.  The Windows Overlooking The Scenery Were Limescaled With Water - With Such A Lovely View It Is A Major Eye Drawing Location And So The Limescale Consequently Makes It Look Unnecessarily Grubby. The Spa Treatment I Had Was Wonderful And The Staff Professional.,,,,,
,73,Used The Sauna  Steam Room And Pool.....Lights Need To Be Checked In The Steam Room - One Missing...It Is The Small Things  The Lack Of Attention To Detail That Do Not Add Up To A 5 Star Experience,,,,,
,75,Loved The Indoor Pool,,,,,
,77,I Didnt Have Time To Have A Treatment But We Did Visit It And We Went To The Pool Twice.,,,,,
,85,Friendly  Approachable Staff With A Genuine Interest In Their Clients,,,,,
,89,Get Some More Staff And Prioritize Guest Requirements Over Local Non Residents.,,,,,
,112,Jacuzzi Could Be Warmer,,,,,
,117,One Of The Shower Cubicles Is Missing A Door.,,,,,
,119,There Was No Soap In The Gents Changing Room Toilets !,,,,,
,121,No,,,,,
,131,Generally Speaking The Pool Felt Cold And The Steam Room Was Also On The Coold Side.,,,,,
,148,The Sauna Was Too Cold And The Showers Were Looking Tired But There Was Always Plenty Of Towels And The Pool Was Very Good.,,,,,
,153,The Pool Was Lovley - Children Under 16 Still Using It After Hours Though! The Gym Was Adequate.,,,,,
,163,Fantastic Views From The Loungers! A Separate  Warm Jacuzzi Would Have Been Preferable!,,,,,
,165,The Steam Room Was Out Of Order.,,,,,
,167,I Think The Jacuzzi Is In Urgent Need Of Updating. Why Would You Have It Joined To The Pool And Cold? It Needs To Be Separate And Hot Otherwise There Is No Point. The Sauna Was Small And Had A Gap In The Door Which Allowed In A Draft And The Steam Room Was Very Average. We Felt That The Spa Facilities Needed To Updated To Be In Line With The Rest Of The Hotel's Standard.,,,,,
,180,To Me 'Exceptional' Means Something Very Specific.  My Experience Was Positive In All Respects  But I Would Not Describe It As 'Exceptional'.,,,,,
,182,We Neither Saw Or Spoke To Any Spa Staff At All!!,,,,,
,191,Only That I Worried About Leaving My Bag In The Changing Room Whilst I Went Swimming.  As A Day Guest It Would Be Helpful To Have A Locker.,,,,,
,193,It Would Be Nice To Have Individual Changing Cubicles.,,,,,
,194,Only Used The Pool  Jacuzzi Etc. Was Surprised To Find The Jacuzzi Was Built In To The Pool And Therefore As Cold As The Pool! I Would Expect A Jacuzzi To Be Warmer  So Felt Like It Was A Waste Of Time To Use. We Also Unfortunately Used The Pool At The Same Time As Children Were Allowed In. Their Parents Clearly Could Not Read The Signs  As The Children Were Jumping In The Pool And I Also Received A Kick To The Head From An Over Exuberant Child!,,,,,
,197,My Wife Was Unable To Book Treatments Because Fully Booked. The Children's Hours In The Pool Were Not Being Observed By Some Guests Which Made It A Little Less Relaxing Than Otherwise!,,,,,
,198,The Changing Room Was Very Small And The Floor Had No Matting So Was Very Wet  Not Very Warm And No Lockers. The Dressing Gowns Supplied Were Very Small And No Staff Were Seen To Ask For Larger Ones.,,,,,
,214,It Was A Shame That The Steam Room Was Out Of Order On All Three Days.,,,,,
,221,I Booked A Treatment For Myself And Daughter - Mine Was Excellent However There Was Some Confusion Over The Treatment Booked For My Daughter And She Didnt Receive What She Had Wanted - An Extra 10 Minutes Was Put On At The End But She Was A Little Dissapointed.,,,,,
,227,Only Used The Pool  Sauna And Steam Room Which Were All Spotless And Enjoyable. Can't Comment On Treatments!,,,,,
,235,In Relation To The Pool Area. We Would Have Used All Those Facilities For A Lot Longer Had There Been Loungers For Us To Sit/Lie On. But These Were Not Available,,,,,
,238,Only That The Cost Would Be Prohibitive  When We Next Visit,,,,,
,239,Changing Rooms Were A Bit Disappointing. No Lockers For Clothes And Little Room When Busy.  Also Not As Clean As Expected. Not Quite 5 Star Standard In Our View.,,,,,
,242,The Changing Rooms Were Quite Basic And A Build Up Of Used Towels Etc Around The Pool By People Who Had Long Left The Pool Area  Felt There Could've Been Someone Checking The Area Every 30 Minutes Or So,,,,,
,243,The Spa Was Fine But It Is Certainly Not On The Luxury End Of Things. The Relaxation Area Was Not Especially Relaxing - There Were Only 2 Recliners And It Was Not Low-Lit. There Were No Complimentary Snacks Such As Fruit  Nuts  Crackers.,,,,,
,244,Fantastic Place To Stay However  Attention To Small Details Could Have Made It Even Better.,,,,,
,245,Jacuzzi Could Have Been Warmer. I Expected More Facilities From The Spa Due To The Quality Of The Rest Of The Hotel Ie Water Jets  Lights & Smells In Steam Room,,,,,
,249,No,,,,,
,255,We Used The Pool And Sauna Room  Both Were Very Nice. There Was A Lack Of Lockers Though. None To Be Exact...So Had To Wait For Someone To Come Out And Get Changed Before Getting One.,,,,,
,257,The Facilities Were Lovely  However The Wate In The Pool/Spa Is Far Too Cold.  I Tried To Get An Appointment In The Spa But Unfortuantely It Was Fully Booked.  On Days Of High Demand Such As Bank Holidays It Would Be Nice If Hours Were Extended.,,,,,
,259,Welcome And Therapists Were Lovely (Especially Kim).  Sundrai Products And Experience Of Treatment Was Lovely - Only Adverse Comment Was That Spa Bed/Couch Was A Little Flat And Hard - A Little Difficult To Fully Relax. All Therapists Knew The Treatments And Could Tell You All About The Products And Gave Excellent Advice On What To Do Or Use In The Future.  It Was A Very Enjoyable Experience And Was Lovely And Quiet And Relaxing.  Several Days On And My Skin Still Feels Great.  Would Not Hesitate To Recommend The Spa,,,,,
,260,My Wife Felt Initially Hurried Even Though She Was Early For Her Appointment.She Was Told She Had Exactly 25 Minutes For Her Treatment.,,,,,
,262,Lovely Pool - Main Reason Why We Return Again And Again!,,,,,
,273,No,,,,,
,278,The Treatment And The Lady Who Provided It Were Very Good,,,,,
,279,Very Welcoming And Relaxing. Therapist Was Lovely,,,,,
,281,Outstanding Massage,,,,,
,288,Fabulous Pool,,,,,
,290,Too Many Children In Pool  Jumping  Splashing  Diving So Not Able To Swim Any Lengths - Big Disappointment As Was The Reason I Booked Break!! There Should Be A Swimming Lane Separate  And A Pool Attendant As No-One Adhered To The Rules.,,,,,
,292,We Used The Facilities  Pool  Sauna Etc.  Rather Than The Spa Services.,,,,,
,294,A Wonderful Surprise Birthday Treat From My Husband  I Would Recommend The Spa As A Day Package To Friends.,,,,,
,295,I Think The Products Seemed Good But It Would Take A Clinical-Style Trial To Assess Their Standard In Comparison With Others.,,,,,
,311,Booked A Half Hour Massage- But Lasted 20 Minutes. For Â£50 Odd Pounds  Would Have Expected The Whole Time. But Not Too Much Of A Worry.,,,,,
,317,Great Massage For Myself And My Daughter.  The Experience Was Fantastic And Kate And The Other Lady ( Sorry Cant Remember Her Name) Where So Friendly And Helped Me Purchase Some Products Again.  I Would Absolutely Use The Spa Again On Our Next Visit.,,,,,
,318,The Temparature Of The Sauna Is Too Low (70C). Dry Sauna's Should Be Between 85-95 C. Steam Temperature Was A Bit To High (60?) And Should Be Around 45 C.,,,,,
,327,I Really Enjoyed My Treatment At The Spa  Treatment Rooms Were Excellent And Staff Well Trained. The Pool Was A Little On The Cold Side - Fine If Swimming To Keep Fit But A Little Chilly If Lazing Around - Particularly The Jacuzzi End - Muscles Not As Relaxed As They Would Be If The Jacuzzi Wasnt Attached To The Cool Swimming Pool. Also  Whilst Loungers Enjoyed A Great View  Some Padding On Them Would Be Great And Also The Option Of Ordering A Drink To Be Served Whilst Relaxing.,,,,,
,332,We Only Had Treatments But Pool Area & Changing Rooms Need Attention !,,,,,
,333,Pool Was Lovely And Facilities Really Clean - Lots Of Towels.,,,,,
,347,Pool Is Fab.  Room In Which Pool Is Was V Hot For My Parents Who Didn't Swim They Had To Leave.  Lady On Reception Was Only Person We Met  Was Fine But Didnt' Go Out Of Way To Explain How Everything Worked As Was Our First Time There.,,,,,
,350,Beautiful,,,,,
,351,Spa Was A Total Let Down  The Steam Room Is Dated And Does Not Work Well. No Separate Jacuzzi. We Felt With The Spectacular View An Outdoor Jacuzzi Would Be Lovely. No Reading Material  Or Drinks Service. We Felt To Was Very Poor In Relation To The Rest Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,355,Lovely Pool And Steam Room And Relaxing Area But (A) Pool Chlorine Seemed Uncomfortably Strong; (B) Changing Area Is Inadequate- Overcrowded  No Lockers  No Cubicles And Only 2 Showers So Long Queue At Busy Times (C) Need To Inspect More Frequently: I Had To Report A Large  Patch Of Blood In The Steam Room And It Took A Further 15 Minutes For Cleaning Team To Turn Up- Should Have Been Dealt With Immediately.,,,,,
,359,Only Used The Swimming So Didnt See Any Staff. Very Nice Pool,,,,,
,361,Sorry That You Moved Away From Elemis,,,,,
,365,I Wasn't Able To Get A Spa Treatment At A Time To Suit During My Stay As I Wasn't Informed That I Had To Per Book. Spa Day Guests Seem To Have Preference Over Staying Guests. No Lockers In The Changing Rooms Seems Odd.,,,,,
,369,No One At Reception Of Pool Whilst We Were There. Pool Seemed A Little Tired.,,,,,
,370,It's Great That Lockers Have Been Installed In The Swimming Pool Changing Rooms  But Although I Was The First To Arrive At 0700 On Sunday Morning None Were Available  So People Must Have Been Storing Things Overnight Which Didnt Seem To Be In The Spirit Of How They Were Presumably Intended.  Also One Of The Showers Had The Control Tap Missing So Was Awkward To Turn On And Off.,,,,,
,371,The Spa Was Not Really Spa - There Is A Beauty Salon On The First Floor But Without A Steam Room/Jacuzzi/Sauna Etc. It's Can't Be Described As A Spa. The Swimming Pool  Steam Room And Sauna Were On The Lower Ground Floor Quite Apart From Everything Else And Was Full Of Parents And Their Kids. The 'Jacuzzi' (Normally Our Favourite Thing On A Spa Day!) Was Just The End Of The Swimming Pool So Was The Same Temperature I.E. Not Very Warm. It Was Also Full Of Kids  Being The Only Shallow Bit Of The Pool. So We Gave Up On This Which Was Very Disappointing. Also  During My Treatment  All I Could Hear Was Shouting From People Outside On The Level Below  Above The Normal Relaxing Music - Surely Treatment Rooms Should Be Soundproofed As Much As Possible?,,,,,
,372,Partner Did Not Think That Her Nails Where Of The Expected Quality. I Can Never Understand Why You Did Not Make The Spa End Of The Pool Warm/ Hot!,,,,,
,374,The Swimming Pool Was Lovely And It Was Nice To Have Box Of Floats Etc For The Kids.  As Regards The Spa Treatment It Was Very Good.  I Only Went To The Spa For The One Treatment And Although The Waiting Relaxing Room Was Nice It Is Always Nice To Relax After In A Separate Area Rather Than With Those Arriving.  It Made That Part Of The Treatment Less Relaxing Than It Might Have Been.,,,,,
,376,Ladies Changing Rooms Were Inadequate And Poorly Laid Out.,,,,,
,377,We Love The Pool Area At The Hotel But It Was Let Down On One Day (Saturday Evening) Where It Was Clearly Evident That Nobody Had Attended To The Changing Rooms Or Pool Areas For A Very Long Time - Towels Everywhere  Cups Around The Pool And Floors Generally Dirty.  It Is A Shame As The Facility Is Normally Excellent.,,,,,
,378,We Could Not Use The Pool For Our First Day Due To Reasons Unknown!,,,,,
,395,The Service Charge In The Spa Is Set At A Lower Rate Than I Would Normally Pay.  That Said  The Total Amount Of Service Charge I Was Charged For The Holiday Overall Made Up For It,,,,,
,396,I Had A Facial At The Spa And Felt It Was A Lovely Experience.  I've Had Many 100'S Of Facials Over The Last 30 Years  And This Was Right Up There With The Best Of The Best.  The Back Massage Was Really Lovely Too.  I Think My Therapist Was Called Kim And She Did A Fantastic Job.  I Felt Wonderfully Relaxed Afterwards  And Thoroughly Spoilt.   We Also Used The Pool  Which Is The Best We Can Ever Remember Using In A Hotel Anywhere In The World.  Thank You.,,,,,
,397,Great Staff  Somewhat Noisy From Other Areas Of The Castle (Laughter And General Enjoyment) But Did Not Really Detract From Treatment,,,,,
,398,Rita Was Amazing!! She Made Me Feel Very Relaxed And Tailored My Treatment To Suit Me. I Left Feeling Thoroughly Indulged And Totally Relaxed.,,,,,
,400,The Spa Was Fine But Not At The Same Level As Some That I've Been To In Equal Facilities.  It Was An Average But Totally Fine Experience.,,,,,
,401,While Swimming It Feels Very Dark At The Far End.,,,,,
,403,Only Used Swimming Pool,,,,,
,405,Changing Rooms Are Small. It Would Have Been Good To Have More Sunbeds Available Outside,,,,,
,406,Above Ratings Refer To Pool Area. Jacuzzi A Bit Disappointing As It's Part Of The Pool And Therefore A Bit Too Cold! Steam Room Excellent.,,,,,
,408,Only Used The Swimming Pool And Sauna/Steam Rooms. No Problem At All Here And The Facilities Are Excellent  Nice And Well Serviced. Not Sure What Box To Tick So Just A Comment Here.,,,,,
,428,Did Not Visit,,,,,
,435,Unfortunately Both Our Treatments  Which Were Part Of The Valentines Package Were Disappointing. I Had A Facial And My Partner A Back Massage Both By The Same Therapist Who Although Very Pleasant  Did Not Live Up To The Same Standard As The Rest Of The Hotel. I Think It Would Also Be Worth Considering Having Separate Areas For Those Waiting For Treatments And Those Who Have Received Them. There Is Sufficient Space In The Reception Area For People Waiting For A Treatment To Sit  Wait And Complete Questionnaires Leaving A Quieter Area For Relaxation. In The Shower Cubicles There Was No Shower Gel Shampoo Or Conditioner Which Means That After A Swim Guests Have To Return To Their Rooms Having Once Dried Themselves  To Wash And Condition Their Hair  Or Not Shower And Go Direct To Their Rooms.,,,,,
,436,The Member Of Staff Who Carried Out My Wife's Treatments Was Excellent And Probably The Best She Has Encountered.,,,,,
,437,Just Used The Swimming Pool.,,,,,
,454,We Only Used The Pooland Facilities Which Were Good.,,,,,
,456,I Only Visited The Swimming Pool Very Early In The Morning When No-One Was About.,,,,,
,464,Loved The Pool  Which I Assume Is Part Of The Spa,,,,,
,467,Pool Itself Was Mediocre. Towels Everywhere  Even On Unused Sun Loungers Where Customers Were No Longer Using The Facilities. The Jacuzzi Was Not Hot As It Flowed With The Same Water As The Pool Which Was Disappointing. Steam Room Was Okay. Changing Rooms And Showers Were Terrible!!,,,,,
,468,I Felt That The Changing Rooms Could Have Been Slightly More Luxurious As The Women's Changing Rooms Had Only One Hair Dryer  No Cubicles To Change Into And No Robes To Use Within The Spa Facility.,,,,,
,471,Fantastic - I Enjoyed Every Second.,,,,,
,472,Charlotte The Therapist Was Excellent  The Best Massage Ever - Comment From My Other Half!,,,,,
,474,Although I Enjoyed My Treatment  I Did Not Find It To Be Of Any Superior Quality To Other Local Spas I Have Attended And So Did Not Feel It Justified The Higher Price.,,,,,
,475,Excellent All Around.,,,,,
,476,Very Enjoyable. Staff Were Friendly And Professional.,,,,,
,483,The Massage Treatment Was Average  The Products Used Seemed To Be Of High Quality. The Massage Bed Was Creaky  The Music Chosen Was Far Too Upbeat For It To Be Relaxing  And What Was Meant To Be A Deep Tissue Massage Was Only An Average 'Normal' Massage. The Masseur Did Not Go Deep Enough Into The Muscle And Tissue.,,,,,
,484,It's A Bit Cheeky To Add On A Service Charge To An Already Very Expensive Treatment. Either Don't Do It Or Include The Cost Of The Service Charge In The Total Cost - Nobody Likes Surprises Like That.,,,,,
,486,Very Good Prenatal Massage.,,,,,
,488,The Staff Made This Experience Feel Very Special,,,,,
,489,Really Enjoyed My Experience  Lovely Staff,,,,,
,498,Lovely Swimming Pool,,,,,
,499,No Staff There. Strange Build No Outside,,,,,
,506,I Chose To Use The Pool Before 9.30 And After 5.30 As I Understood This Would Be The Time When No Children Were Allowed.  However  This Rule Was Ignored By Several Guests  And When Members Of Staff Came In To The Pool Area The Rule Was Not Enforced  Which I Found Very Disappointing.  I Love Being Around Children  But This Holiday Was For Relaxation  And I Do Not Find The Sound Of Screaming Children Particularly Conducive To Relaxation!,,,,,
,509,The Jacuzzi Would Benefit From Being Warmer Than The Pool. Appreciate That Is Probably Not Possible Nor A Significant Issue,,,,,
,515,The Sauna Was Broken And The Showers Were Also Tricky To Control The Heat Of.,,,,,
,517,It Was Far Too Hot In The Swimming Pool Area - We Had To Go For A Swim Just To Cool Down! Could Have Done With The Pool Being A Little Warmer And The Air Temperature Cooler,,,,,
,520,In The Ladies Changing Room There Wasn't Much Space To Put Clothes Down As There Were Only Two Benches And People Had Left A Lot Of Clothes/Bags On These.,,,,,
,523,Facilities Were Very Disappointing. This Is Actually The Only Negative Thing From Our Stay. Compared To Other Hotels Such As Lucknam Park For Instance  We Thought The Experience Wasnt Good Enough. The Water Of The Swimming Pool Had Way Too Much Chlorine  There Was No Hot Tub. The Spa Wasnt Hot And The Changing Room Need Refurbishment. The Area Before Entering The Changing Room Is Very Cold Which Makes It Uncomfortable When We Came Down From Our Room Wearing A Robe,,,,,
,526,Only Used The Swimming Pool,,,,,
,550,I Got Told The Wrong Information For What Treatment I Was Entitled To With My Package Which I Thought Was A Little Unprofessionl.,,,,,
,553,The Sauna Wasn't Hot Enough (60 Degrees) And The Steam Room Could Do With Being Steamier And Having Aromatherapy Oil As It Smelt Damp,,,,,
,591,Unfortunately The Sauna Was Not Working And The Pool Area A Bit Untidy When We Visited But Otherwise Lovely.  The Ladies Who Gave Myself And My 2 Girls Treatments Were Fantastic And Could Not Have Been Nicer.,,,,,
,593,Treatments Were Excellent.,,,,,
,597,Having Been To Many Spas This Was A Disappointment. Firstly  There Were No Recliners Around The Pool And There Were A Few Broken Chairs. The Sauna Was Luke Warm As Was The Steam Room So They Were Pretty Pointless. My Husband And I Wanted The Same Treatment Which Was One Of The Main Treatments But Were Told That Only One Person Was Trained To Do This Which Seems A Bit Bonkers So I Had To Settle For A Contemporary Treatment Which Was Neither Here Nor There Although Amy Was Lovely. The Room Was Noisy Though So I Couldn't Relax Properly - I Think It May Have Been Above Reception? All In All I Wouldn't Rush Back For Treatments I'm Afraid. My Husband Really Enjoyed The Specialist Treatment.,,,,,
,599,Only Observation I Have Is That The Swimming Pool Was A Little On The Cold Side.  Again Not A Complaint Just An Observation For Your Use.,,,,,
,603,The General Facilities Are Very Pleasant  The Therapies Though Are A Little Overpriced  And Being Asked To Provide A Gratuity Is Not Really Professional  I Would Not Have A Treatment There Again,,,,,
,604,No Steam Room In Order  8 Children Running Around Shouting And Screaming Did Not Lend Itself To A Relaxing Atmosphere And The Attitude Of The Guy Changing Towels In The Gents Changing Was Far From Professional,,,,,
,605,My Massage Was Not Good.  In Fact My Husband Had The Same Therapist For His Massage And Felt It Was Not Good Either.  We Were Scheduled For Deep Tissue Massages And At Best It Was A Weak Swedish Massage.  Felt More Like She Was Pouring Oil On And Rubbing It In.,,,,,
,608,I Had A 25 Minute Massage Which Was Fabulous  Followed By A 50 Minute Facial. I Was In The Treatment Room Next To Reception And The Noise Was Just Unbelieveable. It Was Not In The Least Bit Relaxing As All I Could Hear Were People Talking Very Loudly At Reception. It's A Shame As The Girl Who Was Doing My Treatment Was Lovely  And I Was Impressed With The Products And The Room. My Experience Was Ruined Though By The Noise.,,,,,
,609,Very Accommodating  Friendly And Professional Team.  Would Definately Recommend.  Facilities (Treatment Areas) A Bit Tired And Limited.  Pool Was Great  Air Temp Very Warm- Ideal For Our Toddler Who Loved It.,,,,,
,615,I Had A Sports Massage And Cannot Belief The Benefit It Has Made - Really Impressed!!; My Wife Had A Massage And Enjoyed That Too.,,,,,
,616,Treatments For Both Adults Were Very Good  But Not Of An Exceptionally High Standard,,,,,
,619,Isolating The Treatment - Good Result. The Overall Spa However Is Lagging Other Places Of 5* Status.,,,,,
,623,The Welcome Room Felt Cluttered Like It Was Tring To 'Be' Lots Of Things But Doing None Of Them Quite Right  However  The Treatments And Staff Were Excellent.,,,,,
,627,The Spa Was Amazing And The Therapist (Eleanor?) Was Lovely. Would Recommend The Spa.,,,,,
,631,Service Charge Was Added Automatically Which I Didn't Like  As I Would Have Done It Anyway.,,,,,
,632,Again  The Spa Waiting Room Is In Desperate Need Of Redecoration.  The Chairs Are Dirty And It Felt Shabby  However That Said The Massage I Had Was Excellent  I Was Super Impressed.  I Have Spa Treatments Regularly And This Was The Best Massage I Have Experienced In A While.,,,,,
,636,After Waiting An Hr I Visited Spa Reception Desk To Be Told My Apt Was 1.5 Hrs Later Than I'd  Booked I Just Wish I Was Told Before I Waited All That Time  However A Reduction Was Made At Check Out Which Helped The Frustration.,,,,,
,638,I Didn't Use The Spa  Only The Swimming Pool And Sauna/Steam Room Which Were All Absolutely Great. One Of The Best Hotel Swimming Pools In England I Have Been To - Stunning Location With Equally Stunning Views.,,,,,
,643,No,,,,,
,645,Changeing Rooms Not Quite Right ,,,,,
,648,More Loungers,,,,,
,652,I Only Used The Pool Rather Than Any Of The Spa Facilities But This Is Definitely My Favourite Pool In The Uk With The Most Amazing View.  The Showers In The Ladies Changing Rooms Are Beginning To Look A Little Tired But The Elemis Products Are Great.,,,,,
,653,The Pool Changing Area Is A Little Cramped For The Size Of Pool.  Lockers Would Be Good.,,,,,
,661,We Just Used The Pool/Sauna Area.,,,,,
,663,We Just Used The Pool,,,,,
,665,Pool Great. A Separate Jacuzzi Would Be Great,,,,,
,666,The Swimming Pool Is Out-Of-Date.,,,,,
,677,The Pool Was Advertised As Adults Only After 1730  Unfortunately Two Rather Noisy Children Remained Until After 1800 And The Adult With Them Did Little To Supervise Them. Maybe The Hotel Staff Could Help A Little  Possibly An Announcement Just Before That Time With Polite Reminders Should They Remain. I Don't Want To Appear Grumbling  But Sometimes It Is Nice To Enjoy Facilities With A Bit Of Peace After A Chain Time,,,,,
,679,Only Used Work Out Equipment,,,,,
,681,Great Pool,,,,,
,683,Great Massage!,,,,,
,703,The People Running The Spa Really Did Pull A Rabbit Out Of The Hat For Me  They Managed To Squeeze In An Appointment For My Wife At Very Short Notice After Initially Saying To Her That They Were Fully Booked - Craig Was The Chap Who Sorted It Out For Me When I Phoned And Explained That It Was All My Fault For Not Booking Sooner Like I Should Have Done.  He Managed To Get An Appointment For My Wife In The End And She Absolutely Loved The Spa Experience.  A Big Thank You To Craig.,,,,,
,712,Looks Very Well Maintained.,,,,,
,721,We Really Enjoyed The Experience Although There Was Nothing Particularly Innovative About It - Definitely A 4 Star Experience  Not A  5 Star.,,,,,
,722,We Only Went Swimming  So We Cannot Really Say.,,,,,
,732,Cleanliness In The Shower Cubicles Could Be Better,,,,,
,770,Katherine Was Wonderful,,,,,
,777,I Didn't Use The Spa Myself But Asked A Couple Of The Girls.  Some Treatments Had Been Great And Some Ok.  Some Noise Could Be Heard While In The Treatment Rooms.  Having Said That They All Enjoyed.,,,,,
,792,The Jacuzzi Within The Pool Would Of Been Lovely If It Was Separate And Warmer.,,,,,
,793,Treatments And Therapists Were Very Good  Although A Bit Pricey And Hadn't Been Aware Of The Service Charge Pool Nice When Empty (Went At Lunchtime) - Wouldn't Have Enjoyed If Busier,,,,,
,795,Facilities And Staff Are Lovely. Treatments Were Good But I Question The Training Of Some Of The Therapists Especially The Massage Therapist.,,,,,
,796,Spa Experiment Was Exceptional But Thought It To Be Overpriced.,,,,,
,797,The Water In The Main Pool Was Quite Cold,,,,,
,800,My Beautician Was Very Friendly And Accommodating,,,,,
,802,My Massage Was The Best I Have Ever Received From A Spa Facility.  I Think The Person's Name Was Rita.  She Was Excellent.,,,,,
,803,Overall The Experience Was Excellent. For A Hotel Of This Standard And Quality  The Dining Was Not As Good As I Would Have Expected In Both The Edwardian Grill And The Oak Bar. As An Example  I Ordered A Sandwich In The Oak Bar And Was Presented With What Appeared To Be Sliced White Bread From A Cheap Pre-Sliced Loaf. I Would Have Expected Fresh Baked Bread Of A Higher Standard And To Have Been Asked What Type Of Bread I Wanted - No Choice Was Offered. A High Point  However  Was The Cheese Trolley Which Was Fantastic!,,,,,
,804,One Treatment Felt Rather Rushed. Otherwise Excellent.,,,,,
,807,A Little On The Expensive Side Compared To Other Spa's I Have Used  Although Treatment And Service Was Good,,,,,
,811,The Treatment Room Did Not Appear Clean It Looked Dusty,,,,,
,812,We Would All Three Happily Come Back To The Spa,,,,,
,813,My Wife Returned From Having Her Nails Treated Having Had 5 Fingers Badly Cut. The Bleeding Lasted For 2 Days On And Off. Terrible!,,,,,
,814,There Was No One On Reception When I Arrived For My Appointment There Is A Sign To Say Wait In A Room This Room Is Not Indicated. My Treatment Was Ok To The Standard Of Any Ordinary Beautician Would Give. When I Came To Pay They Could Not Tell Me If It Had Been Booked To My Room Or Not. I Paid Cash They Couldn't Add Up And Calculate My Chage They Also Did Not Have Any Change So I Had To Wait Until The Girl Went Somewhere? To Get Change. Very Mediocre.,,,,,
,816,A Pleasant Experience,,,,,
,824,Shabby Old Equipment In Gym Badly Needs A Refit. Unmanned!,,,,,
,825,Water Fountain Was Not Working.,,,,,
,826,I Only Used The Swimming Pool...,,,,,
,827,I Actually Just Used The Swimming Pool Area - Which Was Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,830,No,,,,,
,832,Good But Not Exceptional.,,,,,
,835,Loved The Pool Really Good Size For A Hotel Pool And Glorious Luxury To Swim Both Evening And Morning Without Children,,,,,
,845,Pool Excellent But Room Far Too Hot.  Gym Equipment Pretty Average,,,,,
,846,Lockers Would Be Helpful,,,,,
,848,The Sauna Was Out Of Order.  It Was A Shame That The Jacuzzi Was Not Separate To The Pool And Therefore Warmer.  I Would Have Liked An Individual Changing Room.,,,,,
,849,I Am Referring To The Pool  Steam Room.,,,,,
,850,Once The Pool Was For Use By Adults Only  I Would Have Preferred The Toys To Have Been Cleared Away.,,,,,
,852,It Is Not A Spa - It Is A Co-Ed Semi-Public Swimming Pool,,,,,
,858,The Pool & The Sauna/Steam Room Were Lovely  Very Enjoyable.,,,,,
,859,I Am Confusing The Spa For The Swimming Pool ...........,,,,,
,862,Towels Of Poor Quality But Otherwise Nice,,,,,
,864,The Poolside Shower Did Not Appear To Work Particularly Well.  The Showers In The Ladies' Changing Room Were Not Hot Enough.,,,,,
,866,I Just Used The Pool And Steam And Sauna,,,,,
,867,Sauna Ver Tired-Kids Not Controlled  And Very Slippy On Tiles...,,,,,
,919,I Had 2 Appointments With Rita - Facial And Pedicure. She Was Outstanding Both In Her Work And Warm Personality - It Felt As Though Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. A Wonderful Lady.,,,,,
,947,We Only Swam Because The Treatments Were  Too Expensive,,,,,
,973,The Area Is A Little On The Cramped Side.,,,,,
,990,I Found Amy Cold And Uninterested In Giving Me My Treatment.  I Really Felt She Did Not Want To Be Working On A Sunday.  I Would Have Like Her To Ask Me If I Was Warm Enough When I Was Not.  I Would Have Liked Her To Ask If The Massage Was At The Correct Pressure Which It  Was Not.  I Have Trouble With My Neck And Had To Change Positions A Couple Of Times And I Felt Uncomfortable Asking Her If I Could Move My Head.  At The End Of The Massage I Was Covered In Oil And I Asked For A Robe Because I Had Come In My Clothes.  She Said They Did Not Have Any.  I Paid Over Â£90 Which Is A Great Deal Of Money For A Treatment I Did Not Enjoy.,,,,,
,998,I Wasn't Able To Get An Appointment At The Spa  Most Likely Because I Called Too Late So I Can't Really Comment On Treatments Etc.  I Enjoyed The Pool And Reading On The Deck.,,,,,
,1000,I Only Used The Swimming Pool. Disappointing That In Its Design The Window Area Did Not Open So As To Give An Open Air 'Feel' In Good Weather,,,,,
,1004,I Felt The Spa Was Very Poor And Would Not Use It Again. The Actual Treatment Was Very Good. The Pool Is A Long Way From The Treatment Area And Both Look Dated. I Was Suprised To Have To Carry My Clothes Around Because There Were No Lockers. The Relaxation Room Was Cold And Unattractive. We Were  Not Offered Any Refershements  After Our Treatments .It Was More A Saloon Than A Spa. Given How Lovely The Rest Of The Castle Is I Felt The Spa Let You Down.,,,,,
,1005,Showers/Changing Facilities Within The Spa Would Be A Bonus,,,,,
,1007,The Services Were Lovely.  One Was So Good I Had It Twice (Reflexology With Rita (I Think).   Nice And Relaxing.  I Didn't See Any Kind Of Locker Room For Clothes Though  So That Was Unusual.  I Wasn't Sure If This Was A Function Of The Type Of Services I Was Having Or If Your Spa Is Not Set Up That Way. Most Of The Spas I Visit Have A Changing Room With Showers And Steam/Sauna To Prepare For The Services.  If This Was An Option  It Was Never Explained To Me Or Mentioned.,,,,,
,1010,For Me To Mark The Experience As Exceptional There Seems To Me To Be A Significant Flaw In The Set Up.  We Would Have Liked (And The Photographs Implied To Us) - That It Would Have Been Easy To Move Between The Spa  Pool And Sauna Etc.  It Is Hard To Lounge Around In A Relaxed State Even With The Relaxation Room Available - Its Too Small And One Is Not Encourage To Linger There.  We Have Experienced Much Better Setups In Other Places. The Treatments We Had Were Very Good Options For Us And We Selected To Come To Bovey Castle Because Of The Indian Head Massage And The Deep Tissue Massage.  The Showers In The Treatment Rooms Were Excellent.,,,,,
,1021,Lovely Staff Great All Round,,,,,
,1022,I Was A Bit Disappointed That My Treatment Was Done In A Standard Hotel Room Which Looked Like It Was Set Up As An Overflow Treatment Room,,,,,
,1025,The Ladies Were Fantastic And We All Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Treatments And Would Definitely Book When Visiting Again.,,,,,
,1030,I Complained That On 3.10.2013 There Werw Children In The Pool Up To 6.30Pm Having Organised Swimming Lessons - I Spoke To A Receptionist  A Member Of I Guess The Management Team And Then To Mr Aresti To Express Disappointment That Despite All Information To The Contrary  The Pool Was Not An Adult Only Zone After 5.30Pm.  I Was Expecting A Relaxing Evening Swim  Not To Be Amid Loud Coaching By The Swimming Teacher.  Certainly Not What I Expect From A 5* Hotel.,,,,,
,1031,Lovely Pool.  Thank You.,,,,,
,1039,Only Used Pool Area,,,,,
,1040,Used Swimming Pool And Gym Only  Both Good.,,,,,
,1041,I Only Used The Swimming Pool And The Changing Facilities  But These Were Both Of A High Standard And Very Enjoyable.,,,,,
,1044,Only Went For A Swim - Lovely Pool,,,,,
,1047,No,,,,,
,1061,Just Visited The Gym. The Cv Equipment Was Good  The Weights Were In Need Of A Service As Most Were Sticking Or Slipping. Nice Facility To Have Though.,,,,,
,1072,Enjoyable,,,,,
,1075,We Didn`T Use The Spa Area With Treatments But Did Use The Steam Room/Sauna Etc Where We Were Pleased With The Facilities.  As An Improvement Suggestion It Would Be Helpful To Have A Small Spin Dryer In The Changing Facilities To Remove Most Of The Water From Costumes So That They Are Still Not Wet When Being Reused.,,,,,
,1131,Excellent,,,,,
,1132,The Treatments I Received Were Truly A Wonderful Experience,,,,,
,1134,The Therapist Who Gave Me A Massage Was Unkind - I Mentioned I Was Ill And Needed Help With Getting On To The Table And She Disappeared. I Also Asked To Be Taken Back To Room One And She Was Very Unwilling To Help Me Even Though It Was Clear I Am Elderly And Ill.,,,,,
,1136,Only Used The Pool,,,,,
,1137,I Only Used The Swimming Pool,,,,,
,1138,It Would Have Been Nice If The Changing Rooms Had Changing Cubicles And Lockers As There Was No Indication In The Room Or Elsewhere That There Were No Such Facilities.  The Answer To This Of Course Is For Residents To Change Into Their 'Spawear'  Place Their Valuables In The Room Safe  Put On The Robe Provided In The Room And Descend In The Lift To The Spa.  However  Cubicles And Lockers Would Have Been Advantageous.,,,,,
,1142,We Only Used The Swimming Pool. The Changing Facilities Left A Little To Be Desired,,,,,
,1145,Only Used The Pool--Which Was A Good Size And Very Relaxing,,,,,
,1173,Misunderstood - We Only Used The Pool Which Is Great.,,,,,
,1202,The Spa Is Lovely  Just Did Not Appreciate That Given It Was Half Term  The Number Of Children That Would Be There!,,,,,
,1203,Unfortunately I Cannot Comment About The Spa As My Wife And Daughter Used It  But Seemed Very Happy.,,,,,
,1216,No,,,,,
,1219,I Felt A Little Rushed As My Appointment Was The Last Of The Day But It Was Still Satisfactory.,,,,,
,1223,The Spa Was Ok But A Little Basic And Not In Line With The Standard Of The Other Facilities Within The Hotel.,,,,,
,1227,New Bucket In The Sauna Would Be Useful.,,,,,
,1228,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,1229,I Really Enjoyed The Treatment  The Lady Doing My Massage Was Really Friendly And Made Me Very Welcome.,,,,,
,1230,I Had A Temp Treat Me  As Did My Wife.  Neither Of Us Felt That We Needed To Know She Was A Temp  Whether She Is Or Isn't Is No Concern Of Us As Guests  Felt Like Excuses Were Being Made Up Front Which Took A Little Shine Of The Experience.  Temp Or No Service Should Be Consistent.,,,,,
,1231,Therapist Was Excellent,,,,,
,1236,I Had A Last Minute Manicure And The Manicurist Was Very Professional And Efficient.  I Think It Was Kim (Her Fiance Is A Chef In Your Kitchen).,,,,,
,1238,Kim Was Very Attentive And Proffesional - Knew Her Treatments And Was A Good  Clear Communicator. The Spa Was Well Presented  Good Magazines  Iced Water  Candles - A Calm And Tranquil Atmosphere - Perfect.,,,,,
,1243,Larger  Changing Rooms Would Be Nice. And A Larger Gym!,,,,,
,1249,Much Better Than Some Other Spas  E.G Hilton  And Reasonable To Good Value For Money. Only One Of Us Used The Spa - For Massage  And Head Treatment.,,,,,
,1253,Johns Experience Was Very Good Margarets Was Good,,,,,
,1266,I Did Not Use The Spa  The Comments Are That Of My Wife Who Did.,,,,,
,1271,The Lady That Provided My Treatment Was Very Professional,,,,,
,1272,This Was Possibly The Only Area Where I Would Have A Couple Of Criticisms - There Isn't A Hot-Tub (Just An End Of The Pool That Has Bubble-Jets But Is Obviously Not Warm  So Not Really Nice To Sit In) And There Were A Lot Of Children Playing  Running About And Being Quite Noisy. Of Course It Was Half-Term When We Went And The Children Are Entitled To Be In The Pool  But I Don't Think It Can Be Marketed As A 'Spa Experience' As It's Not Much More Relaxing Than A Public Swimming Pool. I Suppose It's A Difficult One To Remedy - The Only Option Would Be To Build Another Spa For Adults Only (With A Hot-Tub)! The Treatment That My Partner Had Though Was Superb  A Really Intense Sports Massage From Charlie (I Think).,,,,,
,1283,As A Family We Loved The Pool Area. It Is A Beautiful Pool And You Even Provided Armbands That Silly Mummy Left At Home - Thank You!,,,,,
,1284,The Service Given By The Spa Staff Was Exemplary. Friendly  Courteous And Professional.,,,,,
,1288,Very Clean And Nice But Could Do With Some Lockers In The Changing Areas.,,,,,
,1293,No Lockers In The Changing Rooms. No Moisturiser In The Male Changing Rooms. Steam Room Needed Updating.,,,,,
,1294,We Have Used A Few Excellent Spas Both In This Country And Abroad  And Both Agreed That This Was Number 2 On The List! We Both Had A Great Experience. (Just For Info No1 On Our List Is The Grove Just Outside Watford.),,,,,
,1296,Very Clean And Well Maintained  A Pleasure To Use,,,,,
,1301,My First Experience Of A Spa Treatment And I Am Completely Converted. Fantastic,,,,,
,1310,Excellent Team Well Run....Just Get The Pace Of The Kitchen Up To The Standards Of The Rest Of The Resort.,,,,,
,1320,A Sign At The Entrance Needlessly Asks Guests To Check In At The Leisure Reception. We Waited 10 Mins Before Being Told It Was Unmanned. The Towels Had Run Out And I Had To Go All The Way Back Up To Reception To Get A Locker Key.,,,,,
,1324,We Looked At What Was Available But That Was It  To Much Partying To Be Done !!!,,,,,
,1325,Changing Facilities Small And Could Benefit From Further Showers  However Space Obviously Restricted.,,,,,
,1329,I Booked The Treatments Prior To Our Visit And Thought We Booked An Hour Massage For My Husband  Although He Only Had 1/2 Hour Which Was A Little Disappointing My Husband Said He Which The Staff Had Talked The Treatment Through Before As He Was Suprised When He Was To D It Was Finished  Howeve This Did Not Dectract From The Relaxing Experience.,,,,,
,1333,We Went Into The Pool At Just After 5Pm  After A Number Of Children Had Got Out. The Changing Room And The Area Round The Pool Was Quite Littered And Dirty. Other Than That The Spa Was Excellent,,,,,
,1341,Again The Changing Facilities Are Beginning To Feel A Little Tired & Grubby Now. The Pool & Other Facilities Are Lovely. Having Had Treatments Previously I Can Say They Are Excelkent,,,,,
,1342,The Staff Were Fantastic  The Pool And Jacuzzi Were A Little Cold!! Could Have Been Warmer!,,,,,
,1346,I Liked The Relaxation Room And The Peacful Atmosphere Of The Upstairs Spa Suite,,,,,
,1347,My Phone Call  Which Lead Me To E It Took Me 4 Attempts To Book A Spa Treatment. No One Returned Mail To Which I Got A Prompt Response.,,,,,
,1349,Used The Pool And Sauna Areas Very Good,,,,,
,1360,Really Enjoyed My Treatments,,,,,
,1361,1) Water Bucket In Dry Steam Room Had A Hole In It So Could Not Hold Water  2) Afternoon Relaxation Was Spoilt Slightly By Screaming Children - However  They Have As Much Right To Be There As Us - But Perhaps Dedicate Some Time In The Afternoon On Adults Only,,,,,
,1370,I Was Really Pleased With The Spa. Katherine And Her Team Was Very Good Indeed. Full Marks!,,,,,
,1372,Some Of The Gym Equipment Was In Need Of Servicing,,,,,
,1378,We Only Used The Pool Facilities Due To Time Restraints Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,1385,We Only Used The Pool Area. Very Clean. Shame About The Sauna Being Out Of Order.,,,,,
,1396,Would Be Nice To Have Lovely Outside Sun Chairs,,,,,
,1407,Their Very Few Useable Arm Bands Most Were Punctured Or Ripped.,,,,,
,1412,My Wife Used It .................She Was Happy! Enough Said.,,,,,
,1415,The Treatment Was Lovely - Left Feeling Thoroughly Relaxed And Pampered!,,,,,
,1418,A Luxurious  Relaxing Treat. Will Definatly Be Recommending The Exceptional Treatments.,,,,,
,1426,In Our Honest Opinion I Felt The Spa Did Not Live Up To Our Expectations.  The Treatments Were Ok But Not Exceptional And For The Prices Paid We Felt We Would Have Expected More. Having Used Other Spa Hotels And Salons We Had Something To Compare Too.,,,,,
,1427,Pity The Jacuzzi Was Not Working.,,,,,
,1432,The Pool Area Was Amazing By Far The Best Ever Experienced.,,,,,
,1433,Unfortunately My Manicure Was Not Of A Good Standard. The Paint Job Was Not Neat And My Nails Were Filed Unevenly.,,,,,
,1435,Pool Etc - Pool Was Cold  Jacuzzi Jets Were Freezing  Sauna Broken  Changing Rooms Small (No Lockers) But Well Equipped And Beautifully Clean. The 'No Children' Times Were Not Enforced. Spa - In Need Of Some Renovation But The Treatments We Had Were Exceptional,,,,,
,1448,We Have Been Just In The Indoor Swimmingpool. It Has Met Our Expectations.,,,,,
,1452,The Level Of Cleanliness Was Superb.,,,,,
,1462,Felt The Facilities Were A Little Disappointing  No Hot Tub And Aromatherapy Showers Would Be Lovely,,,,,
,1473,As We Only Used The Pool We Are Unqualified To Comment On The Overall Facilities Of The Spa  But The Pool Area Was Stunning( Except That Untidy Guests Had Left Wet Towels All Over The Place So That Might Need Policing A Bit) The Changing Rooms Were Adequate! The Ladies Shower Going Into The Pool Wasn't Working  Neither Was One Of The Hairdryers. I Am Not Complaining... Just Commenting!,,,,,
,1474,Pool Reception Was Not Manned  And Consequently Could Not Get A Key To Any Of The Lockers Which Meant I Had To Take My Bag Into Swimming Pool. Loungers Uncomfortable And Could Do With Cushions. Spa Treatment Was Brilliant  And Rita My Therapist Did An Excellent Job. One Of The Best Massages I Have Had.,,,,,
,1476,My Fiance Had A Spa Treatment Which Was Fantastic And We Used The Pool Area But We Felt That Although Quite Nice It Needed Investment And Improvement  Particularly The Changing Rooms.,,,,,
,1478,The Shower Drippedthoughout Facial Most Off Putting.The New Products Used Are Not Well Know Would Have Prefferd A Well Known Product,,,,,
,1490,Lovely  Relaxing  Wonderful Treatments!,,,,,
,1492,I Wish I Had Booked In Advance As They Could Only Book Me In For A Half An Hour Facial.,,,,,
,1496,The Changing To The Pool And Steam/Sauna Area Did Remind Me That I Was In A Golf Club....  Which Did Not Inspire Me To Book Any Spa Treatments Which Was A Shame,,,,,
,1504,6 Of Our Lady Guests Had A Spa Treatment Which They All Said Was Wonderful!,,,,,
,1511,Thoroughly Enjoyed The Spa But Outside The Rooms It Could Be Rather Noisy.,,,,,
,1514,Lovely Team Of Therapists. Very Welcoming And My Lady Gave Me A Fantastic Massage/Facial.,,,,,
,1517,Great Massage And Helpful Staff,,,,,
,1521,I Had A Brilliant Massage  The Best I've Experienced  Both The Manicure And Pedicure Were Lovely Too. Great Staff  Friendly Conversation  Which Put Me At Ease. I Would Like To Suggest An Improvement To The Ladies Changing Area For The Pool . Lockable Lockers Would Be Helpful To Put Bags Etc In For Secure Storage And A Couple Of Individual Changing Cubicles As Both Children And Adults Were Changing Together.  It Could Be Embarrassing For Some Individuals Maybe.,,,,,
,1523,Very Warm Welcome,,,,,
,1524,Sundari Is A Fabulous Brand  But Very Pricey In The Uk,,,,,
,1533,Many Thanks To Amy For A Lovely Treatment.,,,,,
,1535,The Therapists Are Really Friendly And My Overall Experience Great. I Didn't Have Time To Use Facilities On This Last Visit But Good Opinion Overall. The Sundari Facial Products Are Ok But The Body Treatments Are Nice.,,,,,
,1537,My Daughter And I Had A Lovely Mummy And Daughter Spa Treatment With Eleanor And Debbie.,,,,,
,1539,Plenty Of Towels An Nice Shampoo Etc I Would Have Put 'Strongly Agree' But The Steam Room Was Out Of Order!,,,,,
,1551,Noticed That The Showers In The Gents Changing Had A Small Amount Of Mildew Around The Seals  Other Than That Extremely Clean,,,,,
,1552,I Thought The Cleanliness Of The Pool And Pool Area Was Excellent.  Best I Have Been To From Any Hotel I Have Visited.  10/10,,,,,
,1553,Very Professional And Relaxing.,,,,,
,1559,Our Original Reservation Seemed To Have Been Missed Onthe Spa Scheduling  However The Manager Was Able To Re-Arrange A Slot At A Later Time During The Day.,,,,,
,1560,Old Swimming Pool And Dilapidated Gym And Place Needs A Complete Overall To Bring In Line With 5* London Facilities,,,,,
,1561,We Only Swam And Used The Sauna.,,,,,
,1564,In A Spa I Have Never Been So Relaxed And Impressed By Your 3 Hour Treatment And Something New  Reflexology Your Spa Girls Were Delightful In Particular  I Should Remember Her Name  Who Cared For Me For 3 Hours,,,,,
,1567,Very Wonderful  But I Was In Treatment Room 6 (Opposite The Reception Desk) And There Was Distraction From Outside Noise Of A Lorry And People Talking Loudly Right Outside The Window.,,,,,
,1569,We Didn't Have Any Actual Treatments But Did Use The Pool  Sauna  Steam Room Etc. Overall It Was Ok But As Earlier Indicated  Could Use A Little Tlc In Order To Make It Truly Excellent. Just Little Touches That Should Be Sorted At This Level Were Overlooked E.G. The Sauna Bucket Was Always Empty  There Was A Few Plasters Floating Around In The Pool Etc Etc - Nothing Too Major But Like I Say  At This Level There Should Be A Member Of Staff Just Poking Their Head Around The Corner To Maintain Your Exacting Standards.,,,,,
,1572,A Minor Note; A Hot Jacuzzi Would Have Added To The Experience.,,,,,
,1575,A Really Good Experience  And (As Per The Rest Of Our Stay) The Staff Were Attentive And Efficient.  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble  And They Were Always Will And Able To Help.,,,,,
,1577,Thoroughly Enjoyed My Massage. The Spa Staff Were Very Friendly And Professional.,,,,,
,1580,No,,,,,
,1581,I Loved It - The Swimming Pool In Particular Is Wonderful!,,,,,
,1592,Didn't Use The Spa  Other Than The Steam Room  Pool And Showers; All Of Which Were Excellent  Inviting  Warm And Very Clean.,,,,,
,1602,Due To Overbooking At Your End  My Partner Couldn't Have The Full Treatment That Had Been Requested On The Original Booking  So Had To Have A Lesser Treatment Instead.,,,,,
,1603,No,,,,,
,1607,Fantastic Staff And The Girls Allowed My Wife And Guests To Have The Treatments At The Same Time  Thank You,,,,,
,1609,My Wife Did Not Appreciate The 'Voluntary' Service Charge Which Was Presented At The End Which Made An Already Expensive Treatment Even More So - Not In Keeping With The Relaxed Atmosphere.,,,,,
,1613,To Top Off Other Comments When I Went Into Have My Treatments They Had Me Booked In For The Wrong Treatment. The Girl Treating Me Quickly Sorted It Out And Luckily Had Enough Time For The Treatment That I Wanted. During The Treatment There Was Some Loud Work Being Carried Out Outside  Grass Cutting Or Leaf Blowing  Again The Girl Treating Me Sorted This Out Very Quickly.,,,,,
,1617,Very  Very Expensive When Compared To Other Similar Quality Spas.,,,,,
,1621,Too Expensive Testament Wise For What You Get And Service Charge On A Service Is Ridiculous!,,,,,
,1626,I Only Used The Pool  Jaccuzzi  Sauna And Steam Room. I Though The Facilities And The Changing Rooms Were Exceptional. They Exceeded My Expectations.,,,,,
,1639,Availability Of Treatments Was Disapponting.,,,,,
,1644,Used The Pool Etc.. But Not The Spa.,,,,,
,1651,Have Always Have A Great Experience In The Spa- Wish I Could Do More Often!,,,,,
,1652,My Wife Was Quoted The Price Of The Treatment ( I Had Booked This For Her Birthday)And I Thought This Was Inappropriate As She Was Also Asked To Sign. I Was In Attendance In The Rest/Waiting Room So I Could Have Been Asked For A Signature.,,,,,
,1653,I Personally Did Not Use The Spa But 3 Of Our Party Did And All Highly Rated Their Treatments.,,,,,
,1655,I Enjoyed The Spa -- I Had A Facial.,,,,,
,1658,No,,,,,
,1663,The Lady Who Completed My Treatment Was Lovely And Really Looked After Me As I Was Pregnant. She Made The Bed Really Comfortable For My Facial And Kept Checking I Was Ok. I Can't Remember Her Name But I Had A Facial And Manicure On The Afternoon Of The 1St Oct,,,,,
,1664,David And I Both Had A Full Body Deep Tissue Massage - The 85 Mins One. David's Was Good  Mine Was Terrible. I Was Freezing During The Treatment And The Therapist Appeared Not To Notice Or Care. I Was A Health And Beauty Therapist So Know The Business Well As I Owned A Salon. The Therapist Seemed Uninterested In The Treatment And Her Technique And Massage Movements Were Not Consistent With Her Training.  Her Technique Was Limited And Very Slow Instead Good Massage Requires Using Various Techniques  To Enhance Blood Flow And Promote Relaxation And Well-Being.   I Had A Facial The Following Day And This Was Very Good. I Did Tell That Therapist That My Massage The Previous Day Was Terrible. I Much Prefer Elemis As A Salon Product  Itâ€™S Range Is Far Broader And Clients Never Complain With This Product. Iâ€™M Not A Big Fan Of Sundari Products. I Think They Lack The Luxury Touch.  ,,,,,
,1665,No Locking Lockers Which Was A Bit Concerning And The Unruly Nature Of The Children In The Pool Maybe A Life Guard Is Required To Stop Children Jumping In And Out Of The Jacuzzi And Bombing Others In The Pool,,,,,
,1671,I Was Disappointed That The 'Jacuzzi' Was Not A Separate  Heated Facility  But Just The End Of The Pool With Bubbles.  The Whole Point Of A Jacuzzi For Me  Is The Hot Water And Muscle Relaxation.,,,,,
,1675,Some Tiles Are Missing In The Pool Around The Jacuzzi Area. As We Did Not Have Robes Initially  We Used The Changing Rooms. The Ladies Was Exceptionally Overcrowded  And The Gentlemans Was Occupied By 2 Men And 5 Little Girls  Neither Of Which Provided A Comfortable Environment!,,,,,
,1680,I Actually Visited The Swimming Pool Which Was Full Of Noisy Children Being Thrown In To The Pool By Their Parents.  It Was Impossible To Actually Swim And The Noise Was Great.,,,,,
,1693,I Found The Facail A Little Disjointed If I'm Really Honest. She Went From My Face  To Feet And Back To My Scalp In The Space Of 5Mins,,,,,
,1697,My Wife Commented That She Thought The Swimming Pool Changing Rooms Were Not In The Best Of Condition.,,,,,
,1702,We Used The Pool Facility But Not The Spa Or Treatments Themselves.  Pool Etc Was Lovely,,,,,
,1710,All Aspects Of The Spa/Pool Were Very Good Indeed. The Treatments Were Superb,,,,,
,1720,Floor V Cold In Swimming Pool Changing Rooms  Also Not Very Good For Changing 10 Month Old Baby - Could Do With A Play Pen For Example In Changing Rooom (Like They Have At Gleneagles). Bit Limited On Facial Options - I Really Wanted Something That Was Deep Cleansing Rather Than Loads Of Oils And Massage E.G. Eve Lom. Pool Was Excellent - V Clean Etc.,,,,,
,1726,Attention To Details Again. The Staff Member Who Took Care Of The Towels Passed A Bin Full Of Plastic Cups And A More Or Less Empty Water Container Without Dealing With It. The Day After It Was Still Not Dealt With.,,,,,
,1727,We Used The Swimming Pool Which Was Fine  Although The Air Temperature Was Very Hot. Unfortunately The Women's Changing Room Was Shut For Decorating. I Would Suggest That You Put  A Large Basket Near The Pool For Guests To Put Used Towels In. I Looked For This But Couldn't Find Anything So Just Left It On The Floor.,,,,,
,1730,One Of The Best Massages I Have Had In A While And My Family Agree.,,,,,
,1735,Only Used The Pool  However We Were Very Impressed With The Quality Of The Pool Area,,,,,
,1737,I Used The Gym   Which And Had No Atmosphere. It Was Cold  No Music And The T.V Was Not Working.,,,,,
,1752,We Just Used The Pool - Nice Pool  And Fitness Suite Which Was Adequate,,,,,
,1756,The Changing Area Lacked Lockers  And People Appeared To Have Randomly Abandoned Their Items On The Floor.  The Policy Was Apparently No Children After 1730  So I Was Disappointed To Find Children Still In The Pool At 1800  Constantly Opening And Closing The Sauna And Steam Room Doors.,,,,,
,1787,All Good,,,,,
,1789,Small Lockers For Clothes While Swimming?,,,,,
,1801,Excellent Sized Pool.   Suggest A Spin-Dryer For Swimming Costumes (Like At Celtic Manor !),,,,,
,1803,No Water In The Water Dispenser In The Changing Room  Poor Quality Of The Mirror At The End Of The Pool. At Least 15 Lights Out In The Ceiling. Dirty Windows Obstructing Your View Over The Valley,,,,,
,1814,I Did Not Have Any Treatments At The Spa Therefore Couldn't Comment On The Staff. There Were No Staff Around In The Pool Area. I Feel It Would Have Been Nice If  Robes Had Been Made Available For Use Whilst Using The Spa To Avoid Changing To Go Back To Our Room   Especially As There Are No Secure Locker Facilities. A Few More Loungers Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,
,1816,We Really Liked The Spa - Especially Design And Decor/Atmosphere Etc. We Tick 'Neither Agree Or Disagree' For The 2 Above As We Didn't See Any Staff And We Had No Treatments Booked.,,,,,
,1823,I Found Some Of The Treatments Very Expensive After Having Visted Ragdale Hall On Many Occasions.,,,,,
,1825,It Would Be Nice To Have Lockers - There Were Belongings Everywhere...,,,,,
,1832,Having Previously Had Treatments At The Spa I Wish I Could Have Done So On This Occasion.,,,,,
,1843,Lovely,,,,,
,1847,Unfortunately We Were Slightly Late To Our Appointments As It Took So Long To Sort Out Our Bill  Which Was Completely Wrong. The Therapists Were Fantastic  But It Was A Bit Of A Shame That You Couldn't Really Remain In Your Swimwear And Go Straight Between The Pool And Treatment Areas. Also  It Would Have Been Nice To Have Some Fruit Teas Available. I Was A Bit Shocked At The Changing Rooms At The Pool And The Towels Available There - This Was More Like School Than A High End Hotel And Spa (Haven't Seen Facilities Like That At Any Other Luxury Spas Or Hotels I Have Been To In My Travels).,,,,,
,1848,Due To Staff Shortage We Had To Break Up Our Spa Treatments And Return To The Spa For The 2Nd Treatment.  We Didnt Mind As It Was A Rainy Day So We Didnt Have Anything Else Planned But For Others It Could Be Very Inconvenient And If It Was A Sunny Day It Would Have Ruined Our Chance Of Enjoying Other Leisure Activities On Offer  The Spa Treatment Was Absolutely Amazing In The End Which Made It Worthwhile  The February Treatment Of The Month Is Fantastic. And The Staff Was Great.  One Of The Best I've Had At A Spa It Would Have Improved Our Experience If We Were Advised In Advance To Use The Sauna/Steam Room Prior To Massage Treatment,,,,,
,1853,It Made The Holiday. My Partner Was Stressed Before We Arrived  But After One Session She Was Very Relaxed And Felt Thoroughly Pampered.,,,,,
,1861,It Was My Wife That Had A Facial.,,,,,
,1864,Nice And Clean.,,,,,
,1874,The Whole Experience Was Sublime,,,,,
,1881,Very Good Massage. Would Have Another Next Time,,,,,
,1885,Was Made To Feel Very Special,,,,,
,1887,We Had Booked An Appointment For An Hour Deep Tissue Massage And They Had Us Booked In For Only Half An Hour. They Did Try To Accomodate By Giving 40 Mins And We Had A Reduced Price On It - But The Massage Was Not Very Good - It Was Not Deep Tissue - More Like A General Massage.,,,,,
,1891,Excellent Facilities  Did Think Spa Treatments Bit Extreme In Cost,,,,,
,1892,I Was Made Very Welcome In A Very Relaxing Atmosphere Which Made My Experience More Enjoyable.,,,,,
,1900,None. Staff Were Very Attentive And Professional.,,,,,
,1901,Unfortunately My Partner Was Disturbed By A Father And His Two Young Sons  Who Were Shouting Whilst In The Pool Area.  My Partner Was Relaxing / Sleeping And Found Their Presence Annoying With No Respect For Others  Thus She Left The Pool And Went Back To Our Room.  Sorry If This Is Not What You Want To Hear.,,,,,
,1903,My Partner Was Left Amazed And She Had Never Fealt So Good After A Spa Treatment.,,,,,
,1907,Romantic  Peaceful And Extremely Relaxing.,,,,,
,1912,I Used The Pool  And Felt That The Water Was Too Cold To Be Able To Use For Long. This Was The Same With The Jacuzzi. Again Finishing Touches Not Maintained  Some Of The Light Bulbs Above The Pool Were Not Working.,,,,,
,1918,My Wife Commented That The Treatment She Received  The Monthly Special  Was Probably Amongst If Not The Best Treatment She'd Ever Had And Consequently Due To The Deal  Excellent Value For Money.,,,,,
,1922,Both Therapists Were Extremely Professional And It Was A Lovely Calming Atmosphere,,,,,
,1929,I Used The Pool And The Sauna/Steam Room So Didn't See Staff  Although Very Well Looked After  Towels Were Changed Without Us Even Noticing!,,,,,
,1934,The Pool And Relaxation Area Was Excellent  It Was Lovely To Relax And Watch The View,,,,,
,1947,Very Pleasant Friendly Staff,,,,,
,1953,The Changing Rooms Could Do With Updating And I Felt Uncomfortable That There Were No Locker Facilities Provided,,,,,
,1957,My First Treatment Was With Rita And It Was Wonderful. My Other 3 Treatments Were With Olivia Who I Think Was New And She Was A Bit Awkward And I Did Not Feel She Was Very Experienced And The Treatments Were Just Average. The Spa Did Not Feel Like A Spa  More Like Bolted On Rooms - Would Have Been Better For It To Have Been Closer To The Pool Area  Offer Cake And Smoothies Etc - More Luxurious Decor Etc,,,,,
,1961,More Lounge Beds Around The Pool.,,,,,
,1972,Possibly Introduce Two Week Manicure Ie Shellac,,,,,
,1974,We Booked A Stay That Included A Spa Package And The Options And Treatments Were Excellent  The Staff Were Professional And Friendly.,,,,,
,1976,I Love It.  This Is The Second Visit To Bovey Where I've Used The Spa.  I Had A Massage On One Day And Reflexology On Another.  Both Treatments Were Brilliant But My Preference Is Definitely The Reflexology.  Rita Treated Me On Both Occasions And She Was Sociable  Professional And I Would Highly Recommend Her.  The Perfect Treat.,,,,,
,1981,The Girls Who Came Down To The Lodge For Our Manicures Were Great And Really Helped To Ensure That Everyone Had A Good Time,,,,,
,1985,Didn't Realise There Was A Jacuzzi At The End Of The Pool And Almost Missed The Sauna And Steam Room  Maybe It Could Be Sign Posted?,,,,,
,1996,The Pool Area Was Very Warm  Almost Unbearably; And We We Rather Disappointed At The 'Jacuzzi' Being Part Of The Main Pool - Meaning That The Water Temperature Was The Same As That Of The Pool.,,,,,
,2009,Fantastic,,,,,
,2010,Great,,,,,
,2011,Magical! From Gill Exworthy,,,,,
,2012,It Was Ok  Though Not Exceptional  Especially The Noise Outside From The Golfers When Having A Facial.,,,,,
,2014,The Spa Treatments Were Excellent.,,,,,
,2019,The Changing Rooms  Pool And Spa Areas Were Very Nice  Clean And Tidy With Plenty Of Towels.  A Very Relaxing Atmosphere,,,,,
,2022,It Was A Shame There Were No Lookers In The Changing Rooms   I Had To Leave My Valuables Behind Reception,,,,,
,2027,It Was Very Good But Others (Such As Chewton Glen) Are Hard To Match. Changing Rooms At Bovey Could Do With Up Grading. Floors Were Wet  No Private Change Area  No Lockers. That Said  Massage Was Very Good.,,,,,
,2037,Excellent.,,,,,
,2039,The Treatment Was Very Good.,,,,,
,2040,The Massage Was Good But The Levying Of A Discretionary Service Charge Was Not Welcomed And Indeed The Therapist At Least Drew It To My Attention And Then Removed It,,,,,
,2041,The Pool Is A Good Size. I T Was Lovely To  Sit On The Loungers And Look Out At The View.,,,,,
,2046,Would Loved To Have Had A Massage But It Was A Little Too Pricey,,,,,
,2059,I Only Used The Pool Which Was Excellent,,,,,
,2060,Beautiful Situation. Views From Pool Were Super. Very Relaxing Time.,,,,,
,2061,We Only Used The Pool/Sauna/Steam Room Which We Considered To Be Extremly High Standard,,,,,
,2063,Unfortunately The Steam Room Was Out Of Order Which Was A Shame As We Very Much Wanted To Use This.,,,,,
,2068,The Assistant Manager In The Spa Was Fantastic At Her Job,,,,,
,2069,We Both Had Massages Which Were Superb.,,,,,
,2072,We Were Impressed With The Pool And Facilities.,,,,,
,2075,Fantastic Deep Tissue Back And Shoulder Massage - Second Best Only To Ones Recevied In Thailand! That's A Massive Complement.,,,,,
,2076,Incredibly Relaxing,,,,,
,2081,Some Of The Towells Need Replacing Especially The Green Ones  Very Tatty And Not Up To Bovey Castles High Standard.  The Large Windows In The Swimming Pool Area Could Do With A Clean Too.,,,,,
,2082,Spa Could Be Improved With Water Jugs  Magazines Etc. We Stay At A Spa At Least Once A Month,,,,,
,2094,Well One We Were Quoted A One Night Stay At 460.00 However Are Bill Was 697.00  I Did Not Have My Reading Glasses With Me So Consequently Could Not Check The Bill Until I Arrived Home.,,,,,
,2095,It Was Expensive,,,,,
,2096,Would Like To Return Maybe For A Spa Day.,,,,,
,2103,I Would Prefer To Only Receive Information About The Products Used If I Ask.  It Is Certainly Not A Hard Sell  But It Feels A Bit Awkward To Have To Say No To A Line Up Products That Are Probably Great  I Just Do Not Want To Purchase Them.,,,,,
,2108,No,,,,,
,2121,Therapist Was Superb And Made Every Effort To Make My Treatment Very Special,,,,,
,2135,The Therapist Made The Experience Very Relaxing And Enjoyable.,,,,,
,2136,Gym Equipment (Cardio)Needs Upgrading,,,,,
,2144,Would Of Had Some Of The Treatments  But Felt Some Of Them A Tad Over Priced.,,,,,
,2158,Used The Sauna And Steam Room And Pool. Not Sure If This Was Actually Part Of 'Spa' Facility As We Never Took A Tour Of Facilities  Just Wandered Around On Our Own To Find Gym And Etc.,,,,,
,2160,Just Pool Used,,,,,
,2165,I Actually Only Used The Pool  But That Was Terrific!  I Did In Fact Go Straight Down From Our Room By Lift To The Basement: At The Hotel Gelert In Budapest This Is What One Does.  One Changes On One's Room And Goes Down In A Towel Dressing Gown.  You Could Make This A 'Selling Point' For Residents Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,2173,We Used The Pool And Sauna/Steam Room Areas Which We All Thoroughly Enjoyed However The Changing Area Felt Quite Small When There Were A Few People In There Getting Ready At The Same Time.,,,,,
,2174,A Shame That The Pool And Jacuzzi Facilities Are Seperate From The Treatment Areas,,,,,
,2176,The Pool Area May Need A Modern Face Lift.,,,,,
,2178,Only Used The Pool Which Was Very Good,,,,,
,2185,Lovely Relaxation Room And High Quality Products,,,,,
,2192,The Pool Is Really Old And The Water Is Too Cold And Has Too Much Chlorine.,,,,,
,2193,Keep The Lawn Maintanance People Away From The Treatment Rooms During The Spa's Opening Hours! They Were Making A Horrible Racket During About 2/3'S Of My Massage.,,,,,
,2199,Looking A Little Dated Compared To Other Spas In Good Hotels. The Pool Was Lovely But A Little Cold  But A Great View From The Beds.,,,,,
,2219,I Was Disappointed With The Jacuzzi  It Was So Cold. So I Went And Had A Bath Instead.,,,,,
,2228,Again  Only A Small Thing  There Was Limited Benches For Sitting/Putting Things On In The Changing Area.,,,,,
,2229,Excellent Spa Facilities .....Saved The Day,,,,,
,2241,My Wife Had The Treatment.  She Has Had Spa Treatments In Hotels And Spas Throughout The World. She Rated This Equal First With The East Coast Usa.,,,,,
,2242,Ny Wife Enjoyed Her Sewimming Experience.,,,,,
,2256,Only Used The Fantastic Pool Sauna And Steamer,,,,,
,2257,We Only Used The Pool Which Was Cold To Us As We Have Our Pool No Less Than 32 Degrees Whereas Your Is Set At 28. The Jacuzzi Was A Waste Of Time And Although The Pool And Jacuzzi Looked Appealing They Were A Poor Experience Which We Shall Not Rush Back Too,,,,,
,2264,The Staff Was Outstanding Friendly - We Really Enjoyed Our Time In The Spa!,,,,,
,2268,Magazines Would Be Nice To Read Around The Pool Area & A Water Machine In The Pool Area  Otherwise Very Good,,,,,
,2272,The Gym Is A Let Down For The Hotel. The Room Is Not Suitable For A Gym- Rather A Pass Through Room From The Lift To The Pool  Equipment Is Not The Most Up To Date  The Tv Worked Intermittently And Overall A Drearily Environment For A Work Out.,,,,,
,2283,Rita Was Exceptionally Nice And Professional,,,,,
,2284,Kim Was Very Professional And Welcoming.,,,,,
,2285,Didn't Like The Very Tiny Paper Pants In The Treatment Room!! But It's Ok  Swimwear Was Kept On! :-),,,,,
,2286,No Hot Water On The Day Made The Treatments A Little Chilly,,,,,
,2288,The Treatment Bed Was Hard And Uncomfortable And I Was Not Offered Any Towels To Improve My Comfort The Treatment Was Thorough And Professional But Not Friendly And No Water Or Post Treatment Relaxation Was Offered. More Thought And Effort And Improvements Could Be Made In This Area.,,,,,
,2294,The Best Indoor Hotel Pool I've Been In.,,,,,
,2319,Changing Rooms Were Very Cold & Cramped  No Lockers And Old Shabby Towels,,,,,
,2320,We Didnt Have A Treatment As I Am A Therapist And Spa Owner,,,,,
,2330,All Staff Very Acommodating Who Try Their Best To Fit Clients In For Treatments On Short Notice. Not An Easy Task But They Manage To Pull It Off.,,,,,
,2338,Pool Was Dirty As Was The Changing Rooms. People Were Allowed To Walk Around Inside The Pool And Changing Rooms From Outside With Shoes On.,,,,,
,2341,My Use Of The Spa Facilities Was Use Of The Swimming Pool  Which Was Very Nice -- A Good Size To Swim Laps And A Pleasant Setting.,,,,,
,2342,Maybe A Re Fresh In The Ladies Changing Area - A Bit Tired Looking,,,,,
,2345,My Daughter And I Had A Mother And Child Massage Which We Both Enjoyed Very Much.  Later I Had A Facial Which Was Very Relaxing.  Thanks To Amy And Maria For A Lovely Time.,,,,,
,2346,Music Seemed Inappropriate To Relax To And In My Treatment Room (Manicure Room) The Cd Player Was Clearly Broken A Kept Stopping And Starting... Irritating.,,,,,
,2347,I Am A Professional In The Spa Industry And Travel The World With My Job  Your Treatments Are Extremely Expensive  Especially The Massage,,,,,
,2348,The Pool Is Lovely  But Again It Was Untidy With Toys  Towels Etc. Left Around The Pool Edge. We Used It 4 Times And Did Not See A Staff Member There At All.,,,,,
,2349,Lovely Pool,,,,,
,2351,It Was The Pool I Visited And That Was Very Nice.,,,,,
,2370,Why Is The Rule About The Pool Being Adults Only After 5Pm Not Enforced?,,,,,
,2404,Wonderful Steam Room!!,,,,,
,2408,Only Used The Pool  When We Stayed There Were A Lot Of Children Which Mean't It Was Not As Relaxing As Usual But It Is An Excellent Facility,,,,,
,2410,Not Sure If I've Misunderstood - Used Pool/Sauna But No Other Facilities,,,,,
,2416,Did Not See Any Staff In The Spa,,,,,
,2418,We Never Saw Any Staff At The Pool.  No Hot Tub Jacuzzi Was Not Good For A Hotel Of Your Standard  Changing Rooms Were Pretty Indifferent Too But The Size And Style Of The Swimming Pool Was Exceptional,,,,,
,2441,Sorry I Thought The Use Of Spa Included The Pool That Is All We Used Twice  Very Nice Pool,,,,,
,2449,Swimming Pool  Steam Room And Changing Rooms All Excellent. Wife's Massage Was A Bit Tentative Though She Enjoyed It (She Prefers A Gentle Pounding As Well As Stroking!),,,,,
,2451,No Locker Keys Available  No Staff To Ask! Noisy Children Spoilt The Atmosphere!,,,,,
,2452,We Only Used The Swimmimg Pool  Sauna And Steam Room Which Were All Very Good,,,,,
,2476,Very Pricey For What You Get  The Spa Its Self Needs A Bit Of A Freshen Up. Changing Rooms Tatty- Entrance To Spa Isnt Anything Special,,,,,
,2483,Spa Was Nice  But I Have Had Better Treatments Elsewhere. I Don't Think The Rooms Were Soundproofed Enough To Make It Relaxing. The Swimming Pool Was Also Quite Cold And Would Have Loved A Jaquissi,,,,,
,2497,My Partner Has Never Had Spa Treatments Before And Normally Wouldnt Like A Stranger Touching Her But Loved Everything About It And Felt So Relaxed.,,,,,
,2498,To Be A True Spa Hotel I Feel A Warmer Jacuzzi Would Be Necessary  Robes And Slippers Could Be Provided  And A Separate Pool Area For Adults. As A Spa Weekend  I Did Not Expect To Be In A Jacuzzi With Screaming Children Before My Treatment . But  I Was Very Happy To See So Many Families Enjoying Time Together And Would Like To Return With My Own Children In The Future.,,,,,
,2500,The Sauna And Steam Room Were Low Quality.,,,,,
,2506,Lovely Pool And The Gym Was Quiet Every Time We Used It. Enjoyed The Massage  And Impressed Overall,,,,,
,2508,The Spa At Bovey Was Excellent - Some Of The Best Treatments We Have Ever Received!,,,,,
,2510,Debbie The Therapist Was Exceptional. She Is A Real Credit To The Spa And The Hotel.,,,,,
,2512,The Massage Was Not Worth The Money. Had To Keep Requesting The Massage To Be Firmer. Felt Like Someone Was Rubbing Oil In Without The Massage. Really Dissatisfied,,,,,
,2514,The Sauna Was Too Cold And There Were No Aromatherapy Oils Used In The Steam Room So It Didn't Smell Very Nice.,,,,,
,2515,The Back Massage My Husband Had Was Very Helpful.,,,,,
,2516,My Therapist Was Really Exceptionally  Lovely.,,,,,
,2521,Katherine Who Did My Pedicure Was Good. The Lady Who Did My Treatment Of The Month Completed A Facial As Part Of That  But Neglected To Tell Me Anything About The Products She Was Using Or Really Ask About My Skin Type Which I Would Have Expected.,,,,,
,2523,Staff Were Nice And Friendly And The Rooms Are Nice As Well. It Is Just That We Do Not Think The Staff Are Very Good At Massaging - I Feel They Just Apply Massage Oil On My Face Without Really Massaging It.,,,,,
,2526,I Was Refunded The Cost Of The Treatment After I Complained About My Treatment To The Spa Manager.  This Was A Good Gesture.  I Had Booked A Head Massage And The Masseuse Made Me Lie On The Bed And Basically Only Gently Massaged The Top Of My Head Without Considering The Back Of The Head  Neck Etc.  It Was Also Noisy In The Spa And Not Relaxing.,,,,,
,2527,The Cost Of The Treatment Was Fully Refunded As It Was Not As Described In The Brochure And I Was Not Satisfied With The Treatment Received.  The Room Did Not Feel Very Relaxing And There Was A Noise From Outside Towards The End.,,,,,
,2530,Thought The Pool Area Was Superb  Loved It And Went Twice.  The Actual Spa Was A Little Disappointed With Faded Sarongs To Lie Under When Having The Treatment.  Would Recommend Bovey Invest In A Bed That Has A Bump Hole If You Are Going To Offer A Pre/Post Natal Treatment,,,,,
,2536,My Mother Used The Spa And Really Enjoyed The Experience.  She Wants To Return And Spend The Day Combining Lunch With A Spa Treatment.,,,,,
,2539,We Both Really Enjoyed Our Treatments.,,,,,
,2543,I Am Not Able To Answer These Questions As I Was Not The One To Have A Treatment At The Spa - Sorry!,,,,,
,2557,Exellent,,,,,
,2558,The Swimming Pool Is Very Good  Using The Lockers In The Changing Rooms Is Very Difficult And Confusing.  The Changing Area Is Not Five Star Standard.,,,,,
,2562,Only The Swimming Pool Was Used,,,,,
,2569,Yes Treatment Started Late And Finished Early,,,,,
,2570,We Only Used The Swimming Pool,,,,,
,2571,We Were Guests On A Thursday. We Expected The Pool To Be Clear Of Children By 1730 As Announced Only To Learn That Lessons Were Being Given Until 1900.,,,,,
,2572,Excellent Swimming Pool  Best In A Uk Hotel In My Experience.,,,,,
,2573,I Actually Used The Swimming Pool; Not The Rest Of The Spa  So 'Quality Of Treatment' Did Not Apply,,,,,
,2604,The Showers In The Changing Rooms Had No Hot Water.,,,,,
,2612,Only Used The Pool  Sauna & Steam Room Which Were All Good But Some Parents Were Allowing Their Children Under 15 To Use Them After 530 - Supervision Needed,,,,,
,2622,We Did Not Visit The Spa,,,,,
,2666,There Were No Staff In The Spa At 8Am,,,,,
,2670,The Pool Area Is Very Much Overheated - Its Almost Like An Outdoor Steam Room  Not Refreshing At All.,,,,,
,2680,A Beautiful House In A Fabulous Situation We Will Return.The Manager Was Everywhere But Needs More Kitchen Staff.,,,,,
,2681,Plenty Of Towels Available And Robes. Lovely And Soft. The Ladies Changing Area For Access To The Pool Could Be Improved As Its Not Really Secure For Belongings. Would  Like To Suggest Lockable Lockers For Bags Etc.,,,,,
,2684,Poor Changing Rooms,,,,,
,2685,Friendly And Welcoming.,,,,,
,2692,My Wife Will Likely Answere The Detailed Questions In Seperate Survey  But Julia Was Very Helpful And Organised An Extension For An Hour So My Wife Could Have Her Treatment. This Was Very Good And Very Appreciated.,,,,,
,2695,Yes The Spa Was Very Pleasant And The Treatments And Rooms Were Excellent. Very Good Standard,,,,,
,2698,The Spa Staff Were Brilliant And Could Not Have Been More Friendly And Helpful. The Facial That I Had On The Day Before The Wedding Was Fantastic And Made My Skin Feel Really Soft.  Thank You To Everyone.,,,,,
,2702,Only Used Treatment Area.. Pool & Changing Rooms Need Attention...,,,,,
,2703,We Were Lead To Believe The Treatment Was For 45 Minutes And Lasted About 30 Minutes. Also There Was No Leaflet In Our Room About The Spa,,,,,
,2704,I Was Not Happy That A Service Charge Was Automatically Added To The Bill. I Think £88 Is Quite A Lot For A Massage  So Didn't Expect To Have To Pay More.,,,,,
,2708,Very Pleasant And Friendly Staff,,,,,
,2718,All 6 Lady Members Of Our Party Found The Spa A Wonderful Experience,,,,,
,2721,Only Used The Swimming Pool And The Air For Far Too Hot And Stuffy For Sitting Comfortably Whils Watching Family Swim,,,,,
,2723,The Gents Changing Room Toilets Had No Soap For Washing Hands !,,,,,
,2727,Be Honest - It Is A Semi-Public Access Family Pool  Not A Spa,,,,,
,2730,Swimming Pool  Sauna And Steam Rooms Were Excellent,,,,,
,2733,Changing Facilities Could Do With An Update,,,,,
,2747,Good Changing Rooms And Very Clean.,,,,,
,2748,Very Clean Including The Changing Rooms.,,,,,
,2753,Very Relaxing Pool Area With Views Over The Moors. Nice That Children Were Asked To Vacate Pool By 5.30,,,,,
,2754,Was Surprised To Find No Lockers Or Individual Changing Rooms.,,,,,
,2762,There Was Nobody At The Reception So Initially We Were Unable To Access The Changing Rooms And Had To Go Back Upstairs To Main Reception To Ask For The Codes. There Weren't Any Keys In The Lockers And No Staff Around To Help So We Weren't Able To Lock Our Things Away. The Jacuzzi Was Quite Cold.,,,,,
,2767,We Did Not Know Where To Sign In To Say We Were Using The Pool. However After Swimming We Mistakenly Went The Wrong Way And Then Found Where We Should Have Perhaps Signed In - 3 Women Were Around The Reception Desk And Were Not Very Friendly Or Welcoming At All.,,,,,
,2768,We Didnt Meet Anyone Who Worked For Bovey Castle Whilst We Were Using The Pool And There Were No Signs As To Where We Should Go To Sign In When Using The Pool.  When I Accidently Went The Wrong Way After Our Swim  To Go Back Up Stairs  I Opened A Door And Then I Found Out It Was The Treatment Area  3 Women Looked Up From What Appeared To Be A Reception Desk And Did Not Look Very Friendly Or Welcoming  Lucky I'd Opened The Wrong Door!,,,,,
,2770,The Pool Is Lovely.  The Jacuzzi Is A Disappointment Because The Water Temperature Is At The Same Temperature As The Pool And It Is Really No More Than Bubbly Water For Children To Play In.,,,,,
,2803,Used The Pool Not Spa,,,,,
,2859,I Really Liked The Spa But Having Been To Lots Of Spas Wouldn't Call It 'Exceptional'. I Had Two Treatments; The First Was Really Lovely And The Second Was Good. I Was A Bit Surprised  However  About The 5% Service Charge  Which I Have Never Had To Pay Before. The Treatments Are Already Expensive And I Felt Awkward About Not Paying The Service Charge But Also Resented Feeling Obliged To Pay It.,,,,,
,2909,The Staff In The Spa Were So Helpful And Very Well Trained. I Had Probably The Best Facial I Have Ever Had And My Skin Three Days Later Is Still Feeling Soft And In Good Condition.,,,,,
,3102,I Found The Gym Very Crowded No Real Space For Free Weights And  Machines Old!,,,,,
,3105,Changing Rooms Are A Bit Tired  But Loved The Elimis Shampoo Etc And Free Use Of Towels.,,,,,
,3115,The Threapist Was A Bit Vague And Cold  She Should Be More Confident With Her Approach When Telling Me Where To Go And What To Do.,,,,,
,3707,Slightly Frustrated When Using The Pool That There Were A Number Of Children Using The Pool Without Adult Supervision.  They Were Running Around And Jumping Which Made Swimming Slightly Difficult. I Am Aware Though That This Is Due To The Parents Not Observing The Guidelines To Use The Pool.  The Pool Was And Is A Great Asset And Something We Enjoyed Using During Our Stay.,,,,,
,3709,Wouldn't Class It As Exceptional  But It Is Really Nice,,,,,
,3713,Great Pool And Relax Area. Good Standard Of Changing Room.,,,,,
,3716,The Pool Was Lovely  The Air Temp Was Very Hot But The Water Cooled Us Down. But Neither Of Us Could Understand Why The Were Not Lockers In The Changing Rooms - Could It Be The Guests In A Hotel Such As Yours Might Not Want To Swim With  For Example - Their Watches - But Might Not Want To Leave Such A Valuable Item Just On The Bench - However Trusting One Is Trying To Be! In The Ladies Changing Room The Wall Is Looking In Need Of Some Tlc By The Baby Changing Table. The Showers And Products Are Fantastic.,,,,,
,3717,We Only Used The Pool. It Was Pretty Average As Far As Pools/Facilities Go. Also  The Disgusting Looking Box Of Chewed Up / Disintegrating Floaties/Aids For Children Looked More Than Worse For Wear And Unhygienic - They Really Need To  Be Replaced Or Not There At All. Made The Pool Area Feel Unkempt And Dirty.,,,,,
,3724,The Pool Jacuzzi Area Had Tiles Floating In The Water That Had Come Unattached To The Floor. The View From The Pool Could Have Been Improved By Giving The Windows A More Frequent Clean,,,,,
,3728,The Jacuzzi Should Not Be Sold As One As It Is Really Just Bubbles In The Main Pool. It Is Not The Warm Relaxing Soak You Would Expect From A True Jacuzzi! The Pool Was Lovely Though And The Sauna And Steam Room Were Great Although On Our Final Day (A Monday) The Steam Room Appeared To Not Be Working.,,,,,
,3730,The Facilities Were Great But The Men's Changing Room Had Empty Cups And Litter In It When I Entered The Spa Which Were Still There Three Hours Later. My Wife Reported The Same For The Ladies Changing Room Which Had Apparently Flooded.  Great Facilities But They Need Checking More Regularly Or The Overall Price Needs To Reduce.,,,,,
,3731,No One Was On Gym Desk So Didn't Have Anyone To Ask About The Equipment. Water Tank Was Empty In Gym Too. Pool Was Lovely  Great Loungers  Shame Sauna Was Not In Operation.,,,,,
,3740,I Have Visited Between 5-10 Spas In The Past  Mostly Abroad But In The Uk As Well. Bovey Castle Spa Experience Was By Far The Best. The Only Problem Being Not Many Spaces Available On Last Minute Booking.,,,,,
,3741,Some Facilities Were Unavailable. No Forewarning Or Apology Was Given.,,,,,
,3742,They Could Have Been More Sun Loungers Around The Pool And A Selection Of Magazines.,,,,,
,3743,There Was Nobody At The Spa Reception Or Any Staff Around To Ask So We Were Unable To Access The Changing Rooms Initially And Had To Go Back Up To The Main Reception To Get The Codes. There Weren't Any Keys In The Lockers So We Couldn't Lock Away Our Belongings. The Pool Needed To Be Cleaned As There Were Plasters Floating In It And The Jacuzzi Was Cold.,,,,,
,3747,Swimming Pool N Jacuzzi Was Ok,,,,,
,3748,I Only Used The Swimming Pool  No Treatments,,,,,
,3778,You Need To Sort Out The Steam Room  It Just Looks Like It's Falling Apart And There Is No Hose To Clean Off Other Peoples Sweat From The Seat Which Is Pretty Disgusting. Also There's A Bit Falling Off The Wall To The Left Of The Steam Nozzle And You Should Think About Re-Siliconing And Cleaning The Grout. Changing Rooms Are Small And Inadequate If There Are More Than About 2 People In There And It's Stupid Having To Get A Key From Front Desk And Not The Spa Area - It Just Means Everyone That Forgets  Leaves Their Stuff Everywhere. Also You Need Aircon In The Gym. That Was A Joke How Hot It Was In There.,,,,,
,3823,We Enjoyed The Pool And Steam Rooms But That Is All We Used On This Visit.,,,,,
,3838,The Lady Who Done My Prenatal Massage And My Husbands Sports Massage (Same Lady) Was Brilliant,,,,,
,3855,Preferred When You Used Elemis Spa Products,,,,,
,3856,We Used The Pool  Steam Room And Jacuzzi.  Would Have Been Lovely To Have A Warmer Jacuzzi As Separate From Pool.  Sauna Was Sadly Out Of Order.  Pool Was Lovely.  Sitting On The Side Of The Pool Looking Over The Amazing View Was Great!,,,,,
,3858,As An Experienced Spa Goer I Found The Treatments Expensive For What You Got.  Beds Uncomfortable (Seemed Like A Cheap Fold Away Version).  Therapist Was Excellent,,,,,
,3859,Very Hard To Book Appointments,,,,,
,3868,You Need Temple Spa Products!!!!,,,,,
,3871,Was A Bit Disorgansied At The Start - There Were No Gowns In The Changing Rooms For Us (Had To Go Back To Reception And Ask For These) And It Wasn't Clear Where To Go (Tho The Pool And Then To The Spa). We Both Thought The Ladies That Did The Treatments Were Exceptional  They Did It 'Properly'.,,,,,
,3872,Sauna Should Be Hotter  But Overall Nice Facilities And Massage Treatment Was Good  Staff Friendly & Wellcoming  Facilities There Definitely Up To Scratch.,,,,,
,3873,Exceptional Treatments,,,,,
,3874,Shame Gardeners Decided To Cut Hedges Outside So Could Not Hear Lovely Music And My Therapist Finally Asked Gardeners To Move On When She Could Not Drown Out Noise With Turning Up The Music!! A Big Shame,,,,,
,3877,The Spa Was Lovely  Particularly The Treatment Rooms.  Swimming Pool Area Was Also Lovely And Children Swimming Times Perfect. However The Changing Room Facilities Were Appalling And Not To The Standard Of A 5 Star Luxury Hotel/Spa.,,,,,
,3880,It Was Fine But I Did Not Like The Automatic Service Charge. I Don't Mind Giving A Tip But I Do Not Like To Feel Pressured In To It.,,,,,
,3881,It Would Benefit From Having A Hot Separate Jacuzzi.,,,,,
,3885,I Did Not Personally Use The Spa These These Are Comments From My Wife Who Had A Massage.  Compared To Other Spa's She Has Been To The One At Bovey Is Not Great And Coussl Be Much Improved In Terms Of Size An Facillities  The Is Based On The High Standard The Of The Other Facilities The Hotel Offers,,,,,
,3887,Some Areas Looked A Little Tired,,,,,
,3888,Steam Room And Sauna Looked Tired,,,,,
,3889,The Spa Services Were Excellent And We Had A Number Of Treatments Each. The General Pool Area Was Far Less Satisfying. The Swimming Pool Was Temperate Which Is Acceptable But This Meant That The Jacuzzi/Bubble Pool Was Far Too Cold. The Suana Was Nice But Again The Steam Room Was Too Cold. We Only Visited Once On This Basis And Didn't Stay Too Long.,,,,,
,3899,Pedicure Chair Uncomfortable And Also Felt Obliged To Talk To Beautician. Would Have Preferred A Massage Chair And Magazines To Read. Don't Get Me Wrong Though The Beauticians I Had Were Excellent At Their Jobs.,,,,,
,3901,Staff Particularly Warm And Welcoming  We Really Enjoyed The Treatments.,,,,,
,3903,The Sports Massage Was Well Done. The Facial Was Good But The Back Massage  That Was Complementary With The Facial  Was Very Poor; I'd Wished I'd Booked A Proper Back Massage Instead To Guarantee A Beneficial Treatment.,,,,,
,3907,Considering It Is A Five Star Hotel  The Spa Needs Updating.,,,,,
,3909,Spa Is Very Nice  However Not By Any Means Exceptional. Very Cheeky To Want A 20% Service Charge On Top Of Treatment Prices !,,,,,
,3911,I Had A Thoroughly Wonderful Facial,,,,,
,3913,I Was Not Happy That A Service Charge Was Included In The Bill. I Think £88 For A Massage Is Expensive Enough  So Was Not Expecting To Be Pressured Into Paying An Additional Percentage Of The Price On Top. I Have Not Come Across This Practice In Other Spas / Country Hotels.,,,,,
,3914,The Room Was Quite Cold  But The Facial Was Lovely And Overall It Was A Good Experience.,,,,,
,3916,The Shop Would Do Well To Stock Swimming Costumes. Due To Weather Our Falconry Was Cancelled Meaning We Had More Time Than Anticipated And I Would Have Appreciated  In The Circumstances  The Opportunity To Use The Rest Of The Spa Facilities (Originally We Would Not Have Had Time  Thus Not Packing For That.) I Am Sure I Am Not The Only One This Has Happened To!- So Emergency Swim-Wear Would Be Good! (Also Please Note: No Swim-Wear Sold In Chagford  Contrary To Resort Desk Advice  Resulting In A Wild Goose Chase!),,,,,
,3917,Rushed Out Of The Spa At The End Of My Treatments! Products Were Average ( Those Used In The Enlighten Ritual). Reflexology Was Good.  My Partner Had Lazy Man Yoga- He Was Not Impressed. Expected Lots Of Stretching But Only 2 Stretches Performed. He Also Had A Facial And Was Disappointed. Products Not Great.  Gym Was Uninspiring.,,,,,
,3920,The Massage Was A Little Disappointing However I Understand The Facials Were Good,,,,,
,3921,Its Very Difficult To Answer These Questions As Both My Husband And I Had Spa Treatments And The Outcome Was Different.  My Husband Really Enjoyed His Treatment  It Was His First Time To Ever Have One.  On The Other Hand I Did Not I Would Very Much Like To Know Why When We Are Having The Same Treatments  Mine Finished A Full 10 Minutes Before His  The Treatments Started At The Same Time Sooo?? I Felt Very Disappointed But Mixed Emotions As My Husband Was Very Happy With His.,,,,,
,3924,Was Kept Waiting 15 Mins With No Explanation For The Delay.,,,,,
,3927,Relaxation Room Seemed An Afterthought And Not As Stylish As The Rest Of The Hotel. The Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful. The Treatment Rooms Comfortable And Quiet.,,,,,
,3929,The Treatments Were A Tad Expensive,,,,,
,3930,Was Not Offered A Drink Before Or After Our Treatment - We Had To Ask!,,,,,
,3932,The Robe Felt Cheap. Lockers Are Required In The Changing Rooms To Keep Valuables Secure.,,,,,
,3936,Definitely Not A Top End Spa. More Like A Couple Of Rooms Cheaply Put Together. Wouldn't Advertise As A Spa As It Will Only Disappoint,,,,,
,3937,Had Issues Booking Treatments So Did Not Get The Treatments We Hoped For,,,,,
,3938,Pool Was Lovely But I Would Not Advertise The Spa Treatments As Being A True Spa Experience As It Looked Like A Couple Of Rooms Cobbled Together Cheaply To Resemble A Spa Setting.,,,,,
,3941,Lack Of Changing Rooms  Showers  Etc. Is 'Low End' Compared To Most Other Luxury Destinations.  Did Not Provide For A Relaxing Experience Pre- Or Post- Treatment.  Family Had Multiple Treatments.  Quality Was Inconsistent.,,,,,
,3943,Sorry To Say It But: Really Poor Treatment Rooms And Standard Of Treatment Relative To Comparable Hotels: Chewton Glen  Coworth Park  Whatley Manor In Fact Probably The Worst Treatment Offering In A Hotel I Have Stayed In In The Last 5 Years.  It's Not Adequate To Retrofit A Couple Of Bedrooms And Call Them Treatment Rooms  A Kaftan On The Bed Is Not A Good Cover  Treatment Bed Not Comfortable And No Bolster Provided For Knees.  Never Heard Of The Products And They Irritated My Skin.  Staff Inexperienced.  Sorry To Be So Negative But You Are Very Seriously Off The Mark In This Area And You Should Visit Any Of The Country Spa Hotels Or The Day Spas In London To See What I Mean.,,,,,
,3945,Disappointed That There Were Very Few Possibilities As Fully Booked Would Be Nice To Insist On Booking Spa When The Lodge Reservation Is Made,,,,,
,3949,The Jacuzzi Being Part Of The Pool Means It's Cold. Not Very Relaxing.,,,,,
,3951,The Pool Temperature Was A Liitle Cool Butgenerally All Was Great,,,,,
,3952,Please Keep The Water Tub Topped Up In The Sauna,,,,,
,3953,Fresh New Unbleached Towels Needed,,,,,
,3957,Love The View From The Pool Area And The Steam Room Was Excellent,,,,,
,3960,Treatments Are Very Expensive Compared To Other Spas,,,,,
,3964,The Changing Rooms Were Very Odd  No Lockers And Towels Just Above Raditor By Shower.  The State Of The Changing Rooms Was Not 5 Star At All.  I Would Have Expected More Here.  The Pool Was Very Cold And We Did Not Spend Long Here Because Of That.  The Suana And Steam Room Were Nice  But Again We Wanted To Spend Time In The Pool To Relax.  My Partner Really Only Enjoyed The Weekend Because Of The Walks And Not The Hotel Part.,,,,,
,3965,The Jacuzzi Was Very Cold Due To Fact That It Was Located Within The Swimming Pool.,,,,,
,3967,Showers Didn't Work In Men's Changing Room,,,,,
,3970,I Thought The Spa Was Nice Enough. The Lighting Was Terrible In The Reception Part.,,,,,
,3971,Massage Was Too Soft. Prefer More Strong,,,,,
,3976,We Only Used The Swimming Pool  There Were Broken Tiles In The Jacuzzi Of Which My Fiance Found When He Stubbed His Toe And Had To Sit On The Side For 10 Minutes.,,,,,
,3977,Not Enough Space In Ladies Changing Room - Towels Piled Up On Benches So Nowhere To Change.,,,,,
,3980,The Pool Is Exceptional & A Good Size For Swimming. The Sauna Could Have Been Hotter,,,,,
,3983,Clean  Well Stocked Changing Rooms And Lovely Pool.,,,,,
,3984,Great But For Such A Lovely Hotel It's Beginning To Look A Bit Tired.,,,,,
,3986,We Only Used The Pool  And I Was Surprised By The Lack Of Facilities In The Ladies Changing Room. No Lockers  No Cubicles  No Hairdryer Etc - Not What I'd Expect From A Quality Hotel.,,,,,
,3989,There Were No Staff Around  So We Just Went Straight In And Used The Pool  Steam Room And Sauna.  The Pool Was A Bit Cold  So We Didn't Stay In For Long!,,,,,
,3990,Changing Facilities Were Poor.  No Information Was Given About Lockers (None Had Keys Anyway So Belongings Were Left Hanging  So I Took All Valuables With Me To The Pool).  They Were Also Too Small  One Shower Had No Door And Generally Not Up To Spa Standards.  Kids' Equipment In The Pool Was Broken/Grubby.  We Didn't Need Any  But If You Offer It Make Sure It Is In Good Condition.,,,,,
,3994,Moisturiser Missing From Gents Facility For After Using Pool Sauna Etc. Showers Appeared Dirty Around Floor Area And Base Of Door/Cubicle.,,,,,
,3995,Fantastic Pool,,,,,
,3997,Needs Better Sign Pointing To The Signing In Book,,,,,
,3999,One Of The Times We Visited The Spa There Was A Lot Of Children And So It Wasn't A Very Relaxing Experience  However The One Other Time Was Perfect.,,,,,
,4000,The Pool Has A Stunning View  It Would Have Been Nice To Enjoy Reading A Magazine And Some Drinks On The Loungers.,,,,,
,4003,I Did Not Have Any Treatments - Just Use Of The Jaccuzi,,,,,
,4007,We Would Of Liked The Hot Tub To Be Hot  But All Very Nice.,,,,,
,4009,People Were Using ( Adults) The Steam Room And Sauna And Not Showering. I Think You Need Signs To Shower. Not Good.,,,,,
,4010,The Water In The Pool Was Very Cold,,,,,
,4014,Nice Pool And Gym,,,,,
,4015,Would Be Nice To Have A Hotter  Separate Jacuzzi,,,,,
,4018,Changing Rooms Quite Small (Ladies). Had To Wait For Shower,,,,,
,4019,Very Clean  Lovely Products.,,,,,
,4020,Thoroughly Enjoyed It But The Spa At The Southgate Hotel In Exeter Iwhere I Spend The Odd Night With A Few Girl Friends After Shopping Is Easily Equal In Quality,,,,,
,4102,Sauna Steam Room Poor/Dirty,,,,,
,4123,Very Relaxing Environment,,,,,
,4176,The Pool Is In Need Of Attention. There Are Several Mosaic Tiles Missing Around The Bubbling Area And My Husband Grazed His Hand. You Have Several Light Fittings Broken. For A Luxury Establishment  You Should Pay Attention To These Details. Also The Female Changing Rooms Are Small And With Lots Of Kids Around  It Was Like A Public Pool Changing Area. My Clothes Got Soaked. The Stairwell Corridor To The Gym Was Absolutely Freezing.,,,,,
,4178,Treatment Rooms Very Clinical,,,,,
,4205,The Pool Was Great,,,,,
,4215,Friendly And Welcoming,,,,,
,4220,Tried Booking Spa Treatments Before We Arrived But All Full  Sat And Sun Which Was Very Disappointing  As A Spa Hotel More Staff Are Needed To Suit Customer Demand,,,,,
,4225,No,,,,,
,4228,The Staff At The Spa Were Friendly  Professional And Helpful The Pool Changing Rooms Were Very Cold And Lockers Would Be Good - Especially Once We Had Signed Out And No Longer Had The Use Of A Safe To Store Our Stuff. A Closing Hinge On The Inner Door Might Be Useful - I Came Out Of The Ladies Changing Room And Could See A Chap Getting Changed As The Person Just Leaving Had Not Closed The Mens Inner Door! The Pool Was Lovely - A Great Idea To Have Adult Only Sessions.,,,,,
,4230,The Pool Was Very Strongly Chlorinated On The First Day Which Made Our Eyes Very Uncomfortable (Sunday) But It Was Okay On Monday.,,,,,
,4232,My Treatment With Kim Was Superb But My Daughter Found The Person Doing Her Treatment Made Lots Of Flippant Remakes And Made Her Feel Uncomfortable. Great Pool But Poor Changing Facilities.,,,,,
,4233,This Is Not A Spa.,,,,,
,4236,My Wife Informed Me That  She Waited For Some Time To Be Seen And It Was Only When Another Customer Came In With A Member Of Staff  That She Got Noticed. This Made A Fell A Bit Stressed And Has Never Encountered This Before In A Spa.,,,,,
,4237,I Wouldn't Say It Was Exceptional.  My Wife's Facial Was Rushed  She Said.,,,,,
,4238,The Pool Area Needs A Bit Of Modernisation.,,,,,
,4239,I Would Recommend To Hotel Guests That They May Come To The Swimming Pool Area In Their Dressing Gowns. I Didn't Like The Fact That The First Time We Had To Leave Our Clothes On Display And Then We Ended Up Running Up To Our Rooms Wrapped In Towels As We Didn't Want To Use The Public Showers. The Next Day We Decided To Use Our Dressing Gowns. The Pool Was Quite Chilly But Okay For Doing Laps But Not For Floating Around In. The First Day The Pool Was Over Chlorinated Which Made Our Eyes Very Sore. I Was Also Not Impressed With A Service Charge Being Added To The Spa Treatment That I Was Told I Could Not Take Off The Bill. Either Increase Your Prices Or Remove This Please. It Is Not A Restaurant And I Was Quite Happy To Leave A Tip Direct With The Therapist.,,,,,
,4241,The Spa Treatment Was Very Good  But It Had To Be  Given The Price  Which Actually Catapults It In To The Requirements Of Needing To Be Stratospheric  To Be A Fair Deal. By That Standard  It Was Only Fair  Which Doesn't Detract From The Treatment Per Se  Nor The Attitude Of The Lady  Arabella  Who Was Very Good. I Have The Same For A Lot Less.,,,,,
,4242,Love The Candles!,,,,,
,4255,My Wife Said That The Massage Was Better Than She Has Received At Other Spas.,,,,,
,4269,Catherine ( I Think! ---Sat 19Th Nov Pm--Did My Manicure And Pedicure) Was Lovely.,,,,,
,4270,I Had The Mohan Massage  Which Was Nice  But Certainly Not Worth The Heavy £130 Price. I Have Regular Massages Every Week  And Have Had Much Better For A Fraction Of The Price.  ,,,,,
,4271,A Robe Would Have Been Nice...,,,,,
,4273,I Had Expeted To Be Aksed To Relax A Little After The Treatment Which Is Normal For Other Spas. The Room Where The Treatment Was Received Was Decorated Nicely And The Idea With The Pareo Is Wonderful!,,,,,
,4279,Very Relaxing And Professional.,,,,,
,4282,Both My Wife And I Would Agree The Full Body Massages Were Excellent,,,,,
,4283,Very Pleasant.,,,,,
,4289,The Treatment Was Good  But Not Exceptional  Hence Why I Do Not Agree To The Scoring. Also The Pool Area Looks Very Tired  Even Cleaning External Windows Might Help...Sauna Not Working  No Facility To Put Water On Coals. Box With Goggles Floats Etc  Just A Grubby Dump Area!,,,,,
,4292,It Would Have Been A More Pleasant Stay For Us If The Rest Of The Hotel Experience We Had Matched The Very Good Experience We Had In The Spa.,,,,,
,4294,Suggest You Make People Aware When The Pool Is Being Used For Swimming Lessons  Just A Note On The Door Is Enough. Quite A Shock When We Turned Up To Find Hundreds Of Kids Running Around The Place. Not Anti-Kids As We Have Three But We Probably Would Have Gone Back Later That Day.,,,,,
,4301,I Used The Swimming Pool And The Sauna. The Other Steam Room Was Out Of Order At The Time. On One Occasion The Swimming Pool Was Overrun With Kids As It Was Half Term Week. As Adults Only Time Was Not Until Half Past 5 This Was Fair Enough; However  Nobody Came To Check That Children Had Left The Pool  Which For Those Of Us Seeking A Bit Serenity Was Deeply Frustrating. I Also Think That Perhaps The Balance Of Adult Only To Family Time Might Need Looking At.,,,,,
,4302,The Treatmills At The Gym Are In A Bad Shape,,,,,
,4304,We Didn't Use Spa As Treatments Too Expensive.,,,,,
,4305,There Never Appeared To Be Any Staff Around.We Didn't Like The Fact That You Couldn't Access The Terrace From The Pool.,,,,,
,4306,On Our Arrival We Tried To Book A Spa Session For The Following Day  Reception Were Very Willing To Try To Find Me An Appointment. We Tried To Confirm Later That Evening For My Booking (No Result) Tried In The Morning (No Result) Tried Mid Morning (No Result) By Now I Just Felt Angry That No-One Had Got Back With A Definate Answer  So Had To Give Up. Really Dissappointed.,,,,,
,4307,We Just Used The Swimming Pool Which Was Excellent.,,,,,
,4308,My Husband Would Have Liked To Use The Pool 'After Hours'. It Was A Pity It Was Locked So Early.,,,,,
,4309,The Sauna Did Not Function Properly,,,,,
,4310,Staff Were Very Good Nice Setting.,,,,,
,4312,My Family And I Only Used The Swimming Pool Facilities,,,,,
,4313,Only Used The Pool,,,,,
,4316,I Purchased Products And The Lady I Dealt With Was Delightful.,,,,,
,4323,Does This Include The Pool Area??? Yikes!!!,,,,,
,4324,Lovely Space With Lovely Staff,,,,,
,4326,Just Pool Which Was V.Good,,,,,
,4329,Cheap Towels,,,,,
,4331,Extend The Swimming Hours For Children To At Least 6Pm.,,,,,
,4336,Didn't See Any Staff Near Pool,,,,,
,4338,Pool And Changing Rooms Very Clean  Would Be Good To Have A Costume Drier As We Used The Pool More Than Once Each Day. View From The Pool Lovely.,,,,,
,4342,The Spa Was Very Good  But I Have Used Many Spa Facilities And Therefore Would Not Necessarily Say 'Exceptional'! The One Thing I Didn't Like Was Having The Extra 5% Service Charge Put On The Bill. I Know I Was Asked If It Was Ok To Add It  But I Felt Obliged To Say Yes And Yet I Felt The Treatments Were Already Expensive And I Have Never Had To Pay A Service Charge For Spa Treatments Anywhere Else!,,,,,
,4344,We Only Used The Pool And Sauna And Did Not Have Any Treatments.  The Steam Room Hadn't Reached Temperature At 8.00Am So We Did Not Use It.,,,,,
,4346,The Sauna Wasn't Working At All During Our 7 Day Stay And This Was Also The Case Last Year When We Stayed In February.  I Hope It Will Be Working Next Time We Come!,,,,,
,4347,Only Used Pool And Changing Facilities,,,,,
,4350,Changing Rooms Should Be Much Nicer For A Spa Like That. Very Scruffy And Messy.,,,,,
,4351,We Only Used The Pool And The Sauna / Steam Room Which Were In Tip Top Condition.,,,,,
,4353,Beautiful Swimming Pool  Lovely Sauna And Steam Room  Great View From Loungers  However The Jacuzzi Did Not Work.,,,,,
,4354,The Pool And Pool Lighting Is Beautiful.,,,,,
,4355,The Jacuzzi Was Not Working When I Visited. This Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,4356,My Wife Assured Me She Enjoyed A Wonderfully Relaxing Facial And Massage. Thank You,,,,,
,4359,Only Used The Pool Which Was Very Nice,,,,,
,4361,Used Pool And Sauna And Steam Room Once Only. Pool Had Too Many Children After Time Limit Mentioned In Brochure Had Expired. Sauna Not Very Hot So Moved To Steam Room Which Was Better. Saw No Staff At All.,,,,,
,4364,Mass Changing Room  No Lockers  Pool Was Too Cold To Use. Couldntd Use Sauna Or Steam Room As Packed With Other Guests (Perhaps Groupons),,,,,
,4368,Sitting On The Chairs Around The Pool Area Was Very Nice  But It Was Very Hot And I Would Have Preferred It To Be A Bit Cooler.,,,,,
,4370,We Used The Pool.  One Of The Shower Doors In The Gents Changing Room Was Broken/Missing - Obviously Maintained To The Same High Standards As The Bedrooms.  I Was Also Surprised By The Lack Of Storage For Valuables - If Only Ones Room Key.  The Pool Was Nice By The Window But Needed Better Lighting Elsewhere.,,,,,
,4376,The Changing Rooms For The Swimming Pool/Sauna Were Incredibly Small With Clothes Everywhere Due To The Fact That No Lockers Were Available.,,,,,
,4378,I Used The Pool Not The Spa,,,,,
,4382,I Have Emailed You About My Spa Experience But Have Not Yet Received A Reply.  The Hot Stones Treatment Priced At £110 For 75 Mins Is Terrible Value As The Treatment Lasted Just Under 60 Minutes.It Should Not Be In Your Brochure As 75 Minutes As This Is Untrue. I Was Very Disappointed With This But Felt Obliged To Pay The 5% Service As I Would Have Been Embarrassed To Say No!,,,,,
,4428,The Pool Was Relaxing After The 1730Hrs Children Extraction - Which Happened On Time.,,,,,
,4436,Very Nice Pool  Very Well Integrated In The Hotel Structure. I Missed A Hosepipe In The Turkish Bath To Rinse The Benches Before Sitting Down - The Odor In There Was Not Appealing.,,,,,
,4438,Cant Answer Spa Was Used By My Wife ???,,,,,
,4440,Sorry  I Clicked On The Spa Button By Mistake - I Only Used The Pool,,,,,
,4449,We Found The Service Slow.  We Went Into The Bar Prior To Dinner And Were Advised To Sit Down And They Would Serve Us.   We Gave Up Eventually As They Didn't Come.     We Went In After Our Meal For A Liqueur - We Waited - We Waited - Someone Cleared The Table Eventuall Of Previous Glasses - We Were Served.  Eventually My Partner Went And Asked Someone And He Got Served At The Bar - However  Had He Not Had To Walk Around Asking I Think We'd Still Be Waiting.  A Lady Also Staying And Another Guest Also Said That This Was The Downfall Of Your Castle - The Service In The Bars And Restaurants.    We Also Waited Sometime At Breakfast To Be Seated Although Clearly There Were Several Tables Empty Waiting For Them To Lay Up Which They Did At Their Leisure It Seemed Whilst We Waited.,,,,,
,4458,Beautiful Pool With Amazing Views,,,,,
,4533,I Apologize!  I Meant 'The Pool' ... Although I Did Request A Spa Appointment  But They Were Completely 'Booked'.  Next Time!,,,,,
,4539,Wife Had Nails Done  Not Terribly Impressive  So We Didn't Sound Any More Money.,,,,,
,4549,My Wife Inadvertantly Left Her Debit Card At The Spa After A Treatment. She Did Not Realise Until After We'd Arrived Home. She Telephoed The Hotel To Ask If It Was Possible To Post It Back Which You Kindly Did. However  She Was Surprised That You'd Applied A Charge For This Service.,,,,,
,4564,I Was Told The Spa Would Email Me Before I Came To Arrange Treatment. I Didnt Book Anything And Therefore The Timings Were Diffilcult.,,,,,
,4570,Having Paid For 5 Star Accommodation And Leisure Break I Was Surprised To Find Such A High Level Of Children In The Pool Area And Relaxation In The Pool Spa And Saunas Was Not Possible,,,,,
,4595,The Swimming Pool Is Lovely And I Was Well Taken Care Of And Pampered During My Facial And Manicure.,,,,,
,4600,Gym Was A Little Dated.,,,,,
,4607,Loved The Swimming Pool  It Was One Of The Best Hotel Pools I Had Ever Been In,,,,,
,4608,Excellent Pool.,,,,,
,4609,The Steam Room Was Not Hot Enough But Generally The Whole Place Was Lovely - In Particular The Staff In The Treatment Areas.,,,,,
,4610,I Had A Facial Which Was Supposed To Last 25 Minutes. I Was In And Out Within 20 Minutes And In That Time I Had To Dress And Undress So Facial Certainly Did Not Last 25 Minutes. It Was Quite Disappointing.,,,,,
,4611,Very Friendly Professional Staff.,,,,,
,4613,I Had An Allergic Reaction To The Oil On My Last Treatment. My Lips Swelled In The Night And Blistered. We Were Leaving That Morning (Though I Mentioned It To The Receptionist) And It Is My Intention To Write And Find Out Which Oil Was Used So That I Can Avoid It In The Future. Other Than That  The Therapists Were Excellent And Very Knowledgeable.,,,,,
,4615,Nikki Is An Outstanding Therapist And Provided One Of The Best Facials That My Wife Has Ever Experienced.,,,,,
,4616,We Were Disappointed Not To Be Able To Book The Treatments We Wanted On Arrival And Had To Settle For What We Considered Was Second Best,,,,,
,4620,Absolutely Excellent Massage And Very Friendly Staff,,,,,
,4624,The Rooms Were Jolly Cold !!!!!! But There Is One Absolute Great Thing. They Did Not Try And Sell Me Any Of Their Products  I Was Waiting For The Hard Push And It Never Came. Well Done To Them.,,,,,
,4626,The Staff Were Extremely Unhelpful When My Daughter Could Not Access The Swimming Pool Lockers- Left Her Shivering- Basically Told Her She Was Lying-,,,,,
,4627,Yes  Kim Was An Experienced Therapist And It Showed. She Was The Nicest Person I Met At Your Hotel  Remembering I Was There For A Surprise From My Daughters For My Birthday And Wishing Me A Happy One.,,,,,
,4630,Incredibly Overpriced For The Standard Of Treatment. I Stay Regularly At Champneys Tring Your Spa Experience Is Nowhere Near Their Standard And Way More Expensive.,,,,,
,4640,I Used The Sauna Only. The Changing Rooms Did Not Reflect A 5* Envirnment,,,,,
,4643,The Pool Was Excellent,,,,,
,4644,Treatments Are Very Overpriced And Lockable Lockers Would Be Handy But Not A Huge Problem,,,,,
,4652,There Should Be A Separate Area For The Jacuzzi And Not Merely An Extension Of The Swimming Pool !,,,,,
,4653,The Pool Was Chilly And The Sauna And Steam Rooms Weren't Very Hot.  Steam Room Was More Stylish Than Many We Have Been In.  The Changing Rooms Were Small And Crowded.  Unfortunately We Visited At A Time When Locals Were Attending Swimming Classes So The Pool Was Noisy And Changing Rooms Busy.  There Was No Privacy When Changing.,,,,,
,4656,Only Made Use Of Pool  Sauna And Steambath. Pool Was Great. Good Include A Jacuzi  A Cold Dip Pool. The Tempertureof Sauna Could At 80 C Instead Of Only 65. More Steam Could Be Used And A Relax Area Protected From The Noice Would Be Wonderfull,,,,,
,4658,Very Nice But Not Exceptional.,,,,,
,4659,We Only Used The Leisure Pool  Did Not Meet Any Staff - Facility Excellent,,,,,
,4661,Towels In Spa Were Too Small  Also Women's Changing Area Very Crammed.,,,,,
,4674,Only Used Pool And Sauna,,,,,
,4676,I Hope To Have A Spa Treatment On My Next Visit,,,,,
,4687,Exceptional Is A Big Word It Was God But Not Exceptional,,,,,
,4695,Only Used Swimming Pool.  Good After The Children Vacated So Possible To Swim Properly,,,,,
,4775,Sorry  Didn't Use The Spa - Only Used The Lovely Pool.,,,,,
,4809,We Only Used The Swimming Pool  Which I Must Admit Was Lovely.,,,,,
,4815,I Had Booked A Full Body Massage But Was Extremely Disappointed When I Was Taken Into A Hotel Room With A Massage Bed. I Felt Like I Was Not Given The Top Service I Paid For Having A Massage In A Make Shift Hotel Bedroom!,,,,,
,4832,Shouldnt Hav Selected This! Thiught It Related To The Pool Which Was Excellent.,,,,,
,4863,Good Standard Of Treatment. Therapist Was Interested In Making It A Good Experience For Me.,,,,,
,4867,Good To See A Swimming Pool That Was Of A Reasonabl Length.,,,,,
,4871,Wonderful Swimming Pool,,,,,
,4889,Music Would Be Great,,,,,
,4898,A Disappointment Given The Standard Of The Rest Of The Complex  Wasn't Special And Staff Were Good But Not Great,,,,,
,4901,The Spa Experience Was The Highlight Of Stay For Our Wives,,,,,
,4905,The Staff Were Absolutely Tremendous,,,,,
,4929,Only Had Chance For Swims.,,,,,
,4938,One Of Our Party Had A Shellac Nail Treatment Which Had Peeled Off After Three Days  I Understand It Should Lasted For At Least Two Weeks,,,,,
,4955,Pool Is Excellent And View Is Exceptional. Showers Need Some Attention,,,,,
,4959,I Only Used The Gym Which Was A Little Tired  But Adequate,,,,,
,4973,It Would Be Nice To Have A Warm Jacuzzi,,,,,
,4986,The Pool Was Cold  The Chemicals Room Was Left Open The Women Toilets Was Un Attended,,,,,
,4990,First Treatment Was Not Good Enough For The Cost.  Second Treatment Was Better.,,,,,
,4996,The Treatments Are Expensive In Comparison To Other Spas So Need To Be Extra Special To Reflect This. I Felt My Spa Treatment Was Very Average.,,,,,
,4998,Superb As Always  Lovely Girls  Super Friendly And Kind.,,,,,
,5002,Outside Hot Tub Would Have Made It Perfection. ,,,,,
,5003,Treatments Always Great At The Spa  Perhaps A Little More Comfort In The Pool Area Such As Padded Loungers And A Phone For Drinks Service By The Pool Would Be Nice.,,,,,
,5009,Difficult To Get Mobile Phone Connection But Used Room Phone And Negotiated Fair Rates. Excellent Management Saved The Day!,,,,,
,5021,Execellent Massage From Kim   Very Relaxing ,,,,,
,5026,No Waiting Room And Therapists Were Fine But Not Great.  ,,,,,
,5032,Spa Pool Was A Bit Cold As It Was Part Of The Pool. Have Stayed At Center Parcs And So Used To A Really Exceptional Spa Experience....Needs A Bit Of Updating To Be Really That Good,,,,,
,5039,Lovely Staff. ,,,,,
,5044,Not Having Locker Keys Available In Ladies Changing Room Was Annoying As Going Back To Reception Was Not Convenient Pool Was Excellent And Spa Facilities And Treatments Were Very Good Although A Little Pricey..,,,,,
,5060,Shouldn't Charge The Service Charge On Spa Treatments.,,,,,
,5068,The Sauna Was Not Hot Enough (Maybe Due To Power Cut),,,,,
,5073,Would Have Liked Some Staff  And A Chance To See The Beauty Suite,,,,,
,5083,We Used The Pool At The Spa. The Pool Is Excellent And The Areas Around The Pool Are Perfect For Lounging As Its Kept So Warm. The Changing Room (Female) Was A Little Tired - And Lockers Were In Short Supply. I Love The Elemis Products Available.,,,,,
,5094,Thanks For Arranging A Hairdresser To Come In On 31St.,,,,,
,5098,Best Massage Ever,,,,,
,5104,The Young Lady Who Gave Me My Sundari Ritual Treatment Was Very Professional And Skilled And I Enjoyed It Thoroughly.  My Skin Is Still Soft And I Am Enjoying Using The Products I Purchased.,,,,,
,5105,I Only Had A Manicure (Shape And Polish)  It Would Be Unfair To Judge The Spa On That Treatment Alone.,,,,,
,5113,The Reception Area Needs A Huge Uplift On Every Level - The Relaxation Room Had A Step Ladder In The Middle Of It! The Service And Facial Was Excellent Though ,,,,,
,5120,There Were Too Many Loose Tiles In The Swimming Pool  And It Cut My Daughter.  The Fixtures And Fittings Around The Pool Were Loose  Dangerous In Part And Need Attention.,,,,,
,5129,Lovely Staff,,,,,
,5139,The  Pool Was Warm; And Very Large.A Recent Stay At Champneys Was Spoilt By A Cold Pool And Cold Environment. Yours Was Excellent.,,,,,
,5140,None,,,,,
,5151,Would Probably Have Had A Treatment If Staying Longer Although Quite Pricey!!,,,,,
,5163,Pool And Changing Room Inc Showers Were Excellent. Mirror Needs Some Panels Replacing.,,,,,
,5166,The Therapists Were Very Good And We All Felt Relaxed After Our Treatments.  Some Minor Updates Of The Facilities Would Be Beneficial E.G Replace The Carpet With Different Flooring  Possibly Heated Tiles Or Wood.,,,,,
,5168,Wonderful Pool Area.,,,,,
,5169,Beautiful Surroundings Rita And Danielle Pleasant And Lovely Treatments,,,,,
,5174,Would Benefit From A Few Plants By Curved Window. Surprised To See Mirror Was Damaged Behind Bench.,,,,,
,5175,It Needs A New Refurbishing  The Tiles And Grout Were Very Mouldy And Need Replacing Or Really Thoroughly Cleaning And Re-Grouting. The Floor Was Wet And Grubby  There Were Dirty Towels Everywhere. Not Enough Staff Looking After The Area. The Shampoo And Conditioner Bottles Were Broken.,,,,,
,5177,Gym Could Do With A Bit Of Tlc,,,,,
,5179,Nb We Only Used Gym + Pool,,,,,
,5180,My Daughter Thought Rita Was Excellent ..Inspired Confidence ..Please Thank Her..,,,,,
,5193,My Wife Managed To Take Advantage Of 30Mins Available On Sunday Morning. She Loved It. Though For The Same Price She Could Have Got Something Similar Or Better Or Longer At Home.,,,,,
,5197,Having Been To Many Spa's Over The Last Few Years I Would Say The Treatments Are Over Priced But It Was The Best Pedicure I Have Ever Had  Slightly Disappointed That For £60 You Didn't Get To Keep The Nail Varnish As You Do In Many Spa's For The Half The Price.  ,,,,,
,5203,Fab Temperature Had Some Children Who Decided To Play Ball With Their Parents In The Jacuzzi Whilst Full Of People Which Was A Tad Odd. ,,,,,
,5205,Great Facial And A Lovely Therapist  She'd Didn't Try Any Hard Sell On The Products And Agreed I Should Use The Ones I've Already Bought Rather Than Clutter My Cupboards With More!!,,,,,
,5207,Changing Facilities Could Be Better. Would Have Liked To Have Had A Kaftan ( Happily Paid Extra For Use Of One) To Wear To Pool As Would Have Preferred To Change In My Room - Do Not Like Communal Changing Areas. Didn't Want To Wander Around In Towelling Robe. Also Was Having A Treatment So Had To Dress And Undress Again And Kaftan Would Have Made Things Easier.,,,,,
,5213,Only Used Pool  Sauna And Steam Room Which Were All Excellent. Not Many Shower Cubicles But Realise Space Is Short. ,,,,,
,5224,Instructions In The Room Info Re Locker Keys Is Too Vague.,,,,,
,5242,Relaxing,,,,,
,5243,A Bit Dated And Tired Looking,,,,,
,5245,Good Size Pool,,,,,
,5246,Only Used The Pool  Which Was Great  Not Over Chlorinated  Beautiful Views  Plenty Of Seating.,,,,,
,5250,I Would Have Appreciated  The Option Of Music To Exercise To In The Gym Room Rather Than The Rather Intrusive T.V. Pool Water A Good Temperature - Thank You! ,,,,,
,5251,The Showers Weren't Hot Enough.,,,,,
,5269,Lovely Pool,,,,,
,5279,I Really Liked The Music Playing In Background!
My Husband Has A Few Stress And Health Issues And He Got Very Good Help And Advice As Well As A Great Massage (Leann Maybe?),,,,,
,5283,Female Changing Rooms Small And Congested. Treatments Excellent,,,,,
,5288,Just Went Into Swimming Pool - Which Was Great. ,,,,,
,5289,No Lockers Available - All That Was Available Was Effectively Equivalent To A School Changing Room Without An Allocated Peg!,,,,,
,5295,Charlotte Was Excellent - Best Hot Stone Massage I Have Ever Had,,,,,
,5305,Excellent Treatments And Very Pleasant Staff With A Good Ambiance.,,,,,
,5316,When We Were In The Pool Area There Was A High Pitched Noise Coming From The Filter Room Pump  You Could Even Hear This In The Steam Room. I Did Report This To The Front Desk And They Said That Some One Would Look In To It As This Did Make The Pool Area Feel Un-Relaxing Due To The High Pitch Sound.,,,,,
,5318,I Think You Should Offer Detox Drinks To Complete The Experience - It Should Be A Health Experience - A Menu Of Spa Cocktails (All Healthy If Course),,,,,
,5320,The Pool Was A Little Cold In The Hot Tub End,,,,,
,5325,Steam Room Was Too Hot For Me!,,,,,
,5327,It Was Expensive And On The Whole Not Sure All It Was Cracked Up To Be - The Spa Felt Like A Few Spare Rooms That Were Turned Over To Treatments. Would Not Rush Back - Certainly Not A Spa Experiecnce ,,,,,
,5328,Lovely Long Empty Pool! Lots Of Fresh Crisp Towels And Powerful Hairdryers. Very Clean Once Again. Perhaps The Cupboards Under The Sinks In The Female Changing Rooms Could Do With A Lick Of Paint - Again A Very Minor Point. ,,,,,
,5333,I Understand Why There Is No Eating And Drinking At The Spa But It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Cup Of Tea While Relaxing At The Pool.,,,,,
,5334,Only Used Pool. Facilities Clean & Well Kept. ,,,,,
,5340,The Treatment Times Are Quite Short For The Price Paid.  I Do Enjoy A Spa Break And Have Visited Quite A Few 'Premium' Spa's In The South West - I Have Not 'Strongly Agreed' That The Spa Was Exceptional Purely Based On Cost Of Treatments.,,,,,
,5342,We Could Not Use The Relaxation Room Due To The Weather - I Think It Had A Leak.,,,,,
,5343,Only Used Pool And Sauna,,,,,
,5350,Very Tired  Needs Updating.  Not A Very Relaxing Experience  Not Enough Beds Round The Pool Area  Not Sure Of The Value Of The Table  Chairs And Garden Bench  Would Get Rid Of These And Replace With More Beds.  The Towels Were Very Thin And Gave The Impression Of Being Cheap.,,,,,
,5353,My Wife Particularly Enjoyed Her Chosen Spa Experience.,,,,,
,5356,Much As The Weather Was Dire Outside  It Was A Little Too Warm In The Pool And Sitting Around The Pool Edge  I Fell Asleep Both Times (On The Lounger)  But Did Find Swimming A Little Too Hot.,,,,,
,5365,Yes The Whole Area Was Far Too Hot - In Fact It Made One Nauseous.  Both Me And Another Guest Had To Cut Our Swim Short Because We Felt Faint.  Also The Pool Opens Too Late In The Morning And Closes Too Early In The Evening.  I Booked The Hotel Mostly Because Of The Spa Facilities Only To Find Them Closed When I Arrived And Open So Late I Could Only Spend A Small Amount Of Time There In The Morning.,,,,,
,5369,Wonderful Product Range. ,,,,,
,5370,The Treatments Are Very Expensive. ,,,,,
,5371,No,,,,,
,5374,Excellent Treatment,,,,,
,5376,We Only Used The Pool   We Were Surprised At The Number Of Children Using It. We Probably Should Have Realised This Would Be The Case During Half Term. We Did Not Stay Long As It Was Extremely Busy.,,,,,
,5377,It Could Do With An Up To Date Over Haul ,,,,,
,5378,I Only Booked A Short Treatment So I Was Unable To Take Full Advantage Of The Experience. Perhaps A More Intensive Treatment For A Longer Period Of Time Would Have Given Me A Better Taste Of The Spa Experience  Which I Will Most Likely Consider The Next Time I Make A Booking. Nonetheless The Treatment Was Fantastic And The Therapists Were Lovely As Was The Therapy Room. ,,,,,
,5382,Due To The Rain The Relaxation Room Was Out Of Action,,,,,
,5383,All Booked Up But Looked Impressive. Pool And Sauna/Steam Room And Changing Rooms All Excellent. Loved The View From The Pool!,,,,,
,5391,We Only Used The Swimming Pool.,,,,,
,5392,None,,,,,
,5399,I Have Used The Spa On A Previous Visit And It Was Excellent,,,,,
,5402,Spinner And Bags For Swim Costumes Would Be Helpful.,,,,,
,5404,Clearly There Was Strong Takeup At The Spa And Contacting The Spa Prior To Arrival Was Not Easy.
Very Much Appreciated Spa Manager Helping To Re-Book An Appointment At 1300Hrs Which Becasue Weather Was Good  We Chose To Spend Time Outdoors.,,,,,
,5408,Feedback From The Ladies Was Very Positive,,,,,
,5415,One Of The Best Facials I've Ever Had.,,,,,
,5416,To Improve The Spa Area Even Further  A Separate Hot Tub Would Top It Off Nicely. Potentially Outdoors Next To The Swimming Pool. ,,,,,
,5417,Special Thanks To Both Kim & Charlie For Making Our Spa Experience More Friendly & Enjoyable.,,,,,
,5422,Treatment Rooms Are Quite Light And Not Soundproof So You Can't Really Relax That Deeply. However  It Was Still A Great Experience.,,,,,
,5424,Only Used Pool And Steam Room  Both Good,,,,,
,5426,Mens Changing Rooms Could Do With A Hair Dryer To Use After Swimming,,,,,
,5428,I Would Have Preferred Not To Have Had The Therapist Trying To Sell Me Products Immediately After My Facial While Relaxing In The Treatment Room As This Impaired My Experience. Perhaps She Could Mention That The Products Are For Sale When The Customer Is Paying As This Would Feel Less Intrusive.,,,,,
,5430,I Have Used The Spa Before And The Staff Are All Lovely. ,,,,,

,Total Responses:,124,,,,,
,Not Answered:,0,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,
,69,Very Pretty Poor Signage - Easier Second Time Greens Quite Slow  Told Sky Caddie Loaded Course Is Wrong?,,,,,
,70,My Father In Law Played 9 Holes. I Spoke To Staff As A Novice And If I Returned Would Possibly Book With Them To Take Me Round 9 Holes. They Were Very Helpful To Engage With Me To Further My Experience Of Golf And Help Me With Improving.,,,,,
,130,Lovely Course. Electric Trolley Hire Would Be Helpful.,,,,,
,148,It Was Just A Shame They Hollow Tined The Greens The Day Before We Played! A Lot Of Them Had Not Been Sanded While We Played  Bad Timing Only!. I Understand This Has To Be Done. ,,,,,
,152,It Is Awkward That A Dog On A Leash Isn't Allowed On The Course During The Golf Round.,,,,,
,153,Being Keen Golfers We Were Particulary Impressed With The Condition Of The Course  And Would Certainly Have Played More Had The Weather Been Warmer - We Brought Half A Set Of Clubs Just On The Off Chance. All In All A Very Enjoyable And Unexpected Experience,,,,,
,159,Some Direction Signs On Course Would Be Very Beneficial To First Time Players  Rather Than Have To Guess Where Next Tee Box Is!!!,,,,,
,160,Signage To The Next Tee Was Poor.  Otherwise The Whole Experience Was Rather Enjoyable And Challenging.  It Was A Pleasure To Play Golf At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,172,I Really Enjoyed The Course Which Was Challenging  Interesting And In Excellent Condition  The Only Problem Being That My Golf Balls Seemed Inexorably Attracted To The River! I Would Definitely Hope To Play It Again Having Now Walked The Course And Realised Where Not To Hit Shots.,,,,,
,180,The Course Is Not Without Its Quirks.  Some Of The Par 3 Holes Were Peculiar  And Sharing A Fairway (I Think This Involved Holes 14 And 15) Is Very Odd.  The Ladies' Tees Rarely Gave Any Real Advantage To The Ladies; This Might Discourage Some. You Might Have A Nicer (More Extensive) Pro Shop.,,,,,
,369,Shame Weather Was So Awful But Great Course.,,,,,
,370,As Always  The Golf Staff Were All Excellent.  My Dad And I Had A Very Good Lesson With Dan.,,,,,
,434,Only Negative Was The Relatively Poor Condition Of The Tees.,,,,,
,787,The Quality Of The Tee Boxes Is Poor. The Course Has Character With Some Weak Holes Near The Enterance. Overall A Nice Experience And Would Love To P Ay Again Now I Know The Course A Bit Better,,,,,
,788,Acquire Better Rental Clubs,,,,,
,997,Would Always Come Back To Play The Course,,,,,
,998,The Course Could Have Better Signage  But I Understand That You Are Limited In What You Can Post.  My Husband And I Were Fortunate To Have Two Members Of The Club Playing Behind Us And They Directed Us When We Were Looking A Little Lost Trying To Find Our Way To The Next Hole.  We Loved The Course Though.  My Husband Played A Second Time By Himself And He Reported To Me That A Herd Of Wild Horses/Ponies Approached Him On The 15Th.  He Was Kicking Himself That He Did Not His Camera/Phone To Take A Picture.  He Said They Were Magnificent.,,,,,
,999,Tee Boxes Were In Need Of Some Attention But Rest Of The Course Superb.,,,,,
,1000,Staff Made A Huge Difference And Stood Out From All Your Other Staff For Their Friendliness And Quality,,,,,
,1001,Only Used The Driving Range But The Course Looked Excellent.,,,,,
,1002,I Couldn't Totally Enjoy My First Round As I Played So Poorly! Some Of The Tees Need To Be Made Completely Level.,,,,,
,1124,Love Comin G,,,,,
,1219,We Were Overcharged On One Item As We Used The Golf Range And This Was Only Realised Later  But Again It Didn't Really Matter And Was Just A Small Discrepancy,,,,,
,1273,Should Have Been Advised The Staff Were Running Late Due To A Tyre Blow Out Which Had Been Advised To Reception,,,,,
,1278,A Fantastic Course In Beautiful Surroundings. Considering The Weather This Winter I Eas Particularly Impressed With The Consistency Of The Greens.,,,,,
,1284,As A First Time Player Of The Course A More Detailed Card Would Be Beneficial. Very Picturesque..,,,,,
,1294,Unfortunately The Golf Course Was Frozen At The Time I Wanted To Tee Off  So I Had To Make Do With The Driving Range. Given The Wet Condition Of Everything It Was A Good Facility.,,,,,
,1306,Unfortunately The Weather On Boxing Day Was Against Us And We Only Managed 9 Holes.,,,,,
,1308,Fantastic Course And A Great Fascility,,,,,
,1315,Slightly Disappointed That We Couldn't Take Our Dog Around The Course With Us.  My Husband Plays And I Don't So We Had To Hire A Buggy To Get Round As Quickly As Possible So Sam Wasn't Left On His Own For Too Long.  On The Majority Of Courses My Husband Plays On Dogs Are Welcome  In Fact At Brancaster  Where My Husband Is A Member You Have To Have A Labrador!,,,,,
,1322,The Three Players All Agreed This Was The Best Round Of Golf Ever - A Great Course  Fabulously Kept And Terrifically Exciting To Play,,,,,
,1435,Fairways In Poor Condition - The Course Needs Work!,,,,,
,1509,It Was Wonderful.,,,,,
,1513,Ross Was Very Nice.   Create Line Items For Golf Expenditures.  My Bill Just Stated Random Golf Clothing Purchases.  Very Confusing,,,,,
,1514,Because Of The Torrential Rain My Husband Was Given A Free Round Of Golf The Next Day Which He Greatly Appreciated. My 10 Year Old Lost One Golf Club And It Was Returned Back To Him After It Was Handed In. He Was Very Thankful.,,,,,
,1521,The Course Provided An Excellent Challenge And Having Now Played It We Look Forward To Playing It Again As  We Have An Idea Of Layout Etc. It Hopefully Will Improve The Score !!,,,,,
,1538,Went To Driving Range  Did Not Play Golf,,,,,
,1548,The Course Was Not Up To Previous Standards Presumably Because Of The Poor Winter And Recent Weather.  It Would Have Been Helpful Had We Have Known In Advance That Buggies Were Not In Use As We Could Have Brought Our Electric Trolleys.,,,,,
,1549,It Would Have Helped To Have Known In Advance That It Was 'Soft Spikes Only'.   Rental Electric Trolleys Would Be Beneficial Especially If Buggies Were Not Usable.,,,,,
,1580,I Played The Coarse About 4 Years Ago But This Was Later In The Year  But Felt It Is Not Up To Chapionship Standards There Were Signs Of Horses Having Gone Over 3 Or 4 Greens. The Coase I Am A Member Of Is Forest Pines In Lincolnshire So I Do Compare All Coases To This.,,,,,
,1590,Everything Was Very Good,,,,,
,1593,Greens In Very Poor Condition For Time Of Year,,,,,
,1603,Weather Was Awful So Only Played 10 Holes Which Was Disappointing.  The Golf Course Was Beautiful.,,,,,
,1639,At Times There Was Nobody Around In Pro-Shop When Looking To Book.  Also As It Closes And Opens To Normal Hours It Was Not Easy To Check Out Availability To Play In Evening. The Range Facilities Were A Long Way Away.  Offering A Free Electric Buggy To Those To Get To And From The Range Would Be A Good Idea.,,,,,
,1652,The Golf Course Seemed Very 'Tired' And Could Do With The Teeing Area Refubishing . However The Layout/Design Was Exciting.,,,,,
,1653,A Challenging Course. Would Have Been More Enjoyable In Better Weather. Would Like To Play It Again.,,,,,
,1675,Golf Course In Good Condition Considering The Recent Weather. An Enjoyable Challenge.,,,,,
,1700,Shame It Wasn't A Glorious Day   My Golf  Was Poor.   That's The Only Fault !,,,,,
,1702,Faultess Service And Very Friendly Staff - I Was Part Of A Hosted Golf Day And The Attention To Detail And Clear Team Work Was Great,,,,,
,1705,Excellent Course. A Big Addition To The Stay,,,,,
,1708,The Course Had Suffered From The Weather - Parts Remain Heavily Water Logged.  The Greens And Tees Were Generally Good  Although Surprised To Tee Off Of Mats On Two Holes Which Was Not Expected Of A Course Of Such Standing In May.  The Greens Did Need Some Work In Places  Although Minor.  The Pro-Shop Was Adequate  But Small For A Highly Rated Course.,,,,,
,1721,Top People...But At Price Of Room At Least 1 Round Should Be Included.,,,,,
,1736,Overall Lack Of Distance Markers On The Course (150M / 100M) And Those That Were There Sometimes Lacked Numbers (Worm Off),,,,,
,1747,Yes..Can You Send My Lost Balls Back?,,,,,
,1752,Considering The Weather We Had Been Having  We Were Pleasantly Surprised With The Condition Of The Course.  It's A Lovely Course And We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Round,,,,,
,1754,The Pro Shop Staff Were Great And The Facilities Were Top Notch  The Only Thing We'd Suggest Is Better Signage On The Course To Direct You To The Next Tee But Other Than That The Course Was In Great Condition.,,,,,
,1766,Weather Was Bad So Only Played 9 Holes,,,,,
,1767,The Greens Were In Poor Condition. Probably Because Of The Wet Weather In The Last Few Months So You Are Excused.,,,,,
,1768,I Had Sent Emails To Reception About Reservations For Tee-Times. These Mails Were Not Answered And I Did Not Get Confirmations. This Process Has To Be Improved....,,,,,
,1779,Tees And Fairways Were A Little Tatty In Places  Greens Had Been Hollow Tined And Were Very Slow. On The First Day We Used The Practice Area Prior To Our Round Of Golf  On Checking Out We Found We Had Been Billed Â£15.00 Not Aware Of Any Charge Seemed A Bit Mean For Residents,,,,,
,1780,No,,,,,
,1781,Excellent Experience.,,,,,
,1782,Even Though It Was Winter  The Course Was Not In Great Condition.  Tees Were Wild! Signage To Holes Was Lacking.,,,,,
,1799,The Golf Course Was Magnificent.  The Golf Staff Were All Really Nice And Helpful And It Was A Pleasure To Play Golf At Bovey Castle.  A Really Wonderful Experience.,,,,,
,1800,The Condition Of The Course Was Disappointing. I Have Played The Course Several Times In The Distant Past. Signage Was Very Poor  And The General Condition Of The Course Was Less Than One Expected Even Allowing For The Harsh Winter. I Do Not Think The Appellation Championship To Be Remotely Appropriate.,,,,,
,1801,Q.2.  Fairways And Greens Excellent;  Tees Rather Scruffy.     Q.3.    Poured With Rain  And I Played Rubbish Except For The 7Th And 12Th.   However  This Is Not Your Fault.  I Shall Return !,,,,,
,1802,It Made For First Class Playing On A Course Beautifully Maintained,,,,,
,2008,My Son Just Used The Driving Range  So Cannot Comment On The Facilities Or Staff As He Didn't Play A Round.,,,,,
,2038,Great Course In A Great Setting.,,,,,
,2126,Just Used The Driving Range.  The Shelter Was Ok For A Damp Day But The Platforms Had Lost The Tee Holders So Were Rather Useless,,,,,
,2127,I Beleive The Golf Course Could Be Suffering From A Lack Of Investment And Some Areas Were Looking Tired,,,,,
,2135,A Challenging But Lovely Course!,,,,,
,2282,Given The Weather  The Course Was In Good Condition. Really Enjoyed The Layout And At Last Play The Course.,,,,,
,2483,The Golf Course Was Below The Quality And Standard That's Expected. But The Hotel Made Up For It!,,,,,
,2484,It Was Very Wet  Also I Didn't Know Where I Was Going  The First Four Holes There Wasn't Signs Out And I Was Walking Around Asking People Where Each Hole Was. I Would Expect Much Better Experience For The Price.,,,,,
,2680,This Is A Good Golf Course That I Have Played Many Times But It Really Needs Some Investment. Some Of The Tees Are Horrendous.,,,,,
,2681,The Wonderful Appearance And Standard Of The Course Was Commented On  Buggy Was Great. Will Be Back To Play The Course Again Now That Are More Aware Of Challenges Having Played It Once!,,,,,
,2682,The Course Was A Delight To Play On Beautifully Maintained,,,,,
,2683,Richard Was  As Always  Excellant  And His Two Assistants Very Helpful.,,,,,
,2684,Bottom Part Of Course Was Very Wet But Top End Was Good,,,,,
,3852,The Greens Were Unplayable On Saturday 24Th August Which Spoiled The Experience Completely. The Greens Were A Little Better On The Sunday After Overnight Rain. Huge Shame Since The Course Itself Is Great.,,,,,
,3853,My Husband Played A Round Of 9 Holes With Our 10Yr Old = Not The Best Game To Play!,,,,,
,3854,If Being Honest  More Distance Markers Would Both Help And Be In Keeping With That Offered On Courses Of Similar Quality. Should Be More Obvious 100Yd And 150Yd Markers. Enjoyed The Layout And The Maturity Of The Course.,,,,,
,3855,Greens Were A Little Slow  But Then The Weather Was Pretty Poor!  Love The Course Though.,,,,,
,3856,Course Understandably Not At It's Best Due To Weather Conditions In The Run Up To Our Stay,,,,,
,3857,Could Use A Garbage Can On The Tee Blocks On Some Holes,,,,,
,3858,Changing Facilities Good  Castle Bistro Not A Great Venue For Golfers - Need More Relaxing Areas Where You Can Watch The Golf Rather Than Rows Of Uncomfortable Tables.  Standard Of The Course Poor Especiallythe Tees,,,,,
,4201,Would Be Nice To Access Drinks Part Way Round Course   Through Buggy Service Or Food Hut. Once You Are Out On Course No Easy Way To Return To Hotel For Refreshment.,,,,,
,4202,The Water Was A Challenge !,,,,,
,4203,The Lady Tees Are Really Small............... :-)),,,,,
,4204,The Greens Were Not Great And The Course Could Do With A Few More  More Obvious Signs To Next Tee The Gps Registered Strange Distances To 5Th Green.  However  These Are All Very Small Points.  We Thoroughly Enjoyed Both Rounds,,,,,
,4205,The Greens Were In Very Poor Condition,,,,,
,4206,The Course Needs A Bit Of Love And Care,,,,,
,4207,Greens Had Been Treated Recently Which Spoiled The Experience,,,,,
,4208,Golf Course Was Untidy And Greens Poor In Comparison To Other Courses Played Recently,,,,,
,4209,Given The High Quality Of The Hotel Was Extremely Disappointed In The Quality Of The Course. Scruffy  Poorly Maintained And Greens In A Terrible State. Can't Believe This Is A Top 100 Course! See Review On Their Website!,,,,,
,4210,Fantastic Course,,,,,
,4211,Fantastic Course,,,,,
,4212,Course Under Repair  And Possibly The Worst Set Of Rental Clubs I Have Ever Hired!,,,,,
,4213,Bearing In Mind It Was Very Quite For The Golf Staff It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had My Clubs And Shoes Cleaned After My Round. A Practice Net Is Also Need Close To The First Tee To Enable Those That Wish The Chance To Warm Up Without Having To Make There Way To The Range.,,,,,
,4589,The Staff Were Excellent. Unfortunately The Greens Were Suffering From Lack Of Rain Having Been Scarified Recently  But I Did Enjoy The Course,,,,,
,4590,I Olayed Early March And Did Not Expect The Course To Be In Top Shape. It Was Ok For The Season.,,,,,
,4591,Greens Were Very Slow.........Golf Layout Is Very Appealing...,,,,,
,4592,Golf Staff Were Helpful And Efficient. Course Was Quite Good And Enjoyable. Could Do With A Toilet At The Halfway Point.,,,,,
,4593,Enjoyed The Golf But The Directions To Some Of The Tees Could Have Been Better As We Were Not Too Sure Where To Go On Several Occasions. A Map On The Score Card Would Have Helped. My Husband Would Have Liked More Distance Markers To The Greens On The Sides Of The Fairways,,,,,
,4594,A Totally Excellent Experience (Apart From The Loss Of Balls In The Water!!).  The Staff Were So Helpful And The Practice Areas Among The Best We Have Ever Come Across.  Also It Was So Quiet - Almost Had The Course To Ourselves. Cannot Wait To Bring More Friends To Share With Us.,,,,,
,4595,A Lovely Course,,,,,
,4842,The Greens Were Too Slow For It To Have Been An Enjoyable Round Of Golf For Me. Also  The Next Hole Was Not Marked For Ease Of Knowing Where To Go.,,,,,
,4843,No,,,,,
,4844,Hire Clubs Booked In Advance Were Not That Requested At Time Of Booking - Dispite Assurances They Would Be,,,,,
,4845,Although Our Ten Holes Were Enjoyable In Such Magnificent Surroundings The Course Was In Poor Condition And Some Of The Holes Of Inferior Standard. The Rough Was Almost Impenetrable And The Greens Very Small. Full Marks To The Professional For Being So Attentive And Helpful.,,,,,
,4846,A Delightful Course,,,,,
,4897,Good And Enjoyable Course.,,,,,
,4901,The Staff At The Pro Shop Seemed Nonchalant And Did Not Describe The Course In Any Detail Prior To Our Outing.  This Courtesy Is Something To Be Expected Whenever Newcomers Play On An Unfamiliar Course,,,,,
,5048,We Know It S Been Wet !,,,,,
,5051,Only Able To Play 8 Holes Because Of The Bad Weather But Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,5055,Considering The Weather We Were Fortunate To Be Allowed On The Course. Only 8 Holes Were Playable.,,,,,
,5057,The Pro Allowed Me Out To Play The Last 8 Holes Before The Light Faded. It Is Therefore Hard For Me To Judge But I'd Love To Come Back And Play 18 Holes In The Summer. ,,,,,
,5096,The Staff Went Out Of Their Way To Fit Me In To Play As The Annual Turkey Trot Was Being Played.,,,,,
,5105,My Husband Played Golf; Not Me But He Enjoyed It Even With The Reduced Course,,,,,
,5188,Weather Was Appalling But Had To Finish The 18 Holes As It Was Such A Beautiful Course. ,,,,,
,5328,Great Facilities Even In The Pouring Rain! ,,,,,
,5349,The Daily Sheet On What Is On - Push The Facilities You Have More  Ie Golf  Falconery  Etc Can Be Booked Especially When They Are Not Busy!!  ,,,,,
,5415,The Golf Was Enjoyable But Half The Course Was Closed Due To The Weather Which Was A Shame.,,,,,

Just Relaxing In Front Of The Fire Without Any Pressure Was What We Liked Best About Bovey.,,,,,

,81,The Manager Was Great. The Valet Staff Were Helpful. Nearly Everyone Else Acted Like They Were A Bit Annoyed With Us When We Made Requests. We Stood At The Front Desk For Several Minutes Without Being Properly Greeted / Acknowledge  While Staff Were On Phone  Talking To Each Other  Or Just Busy With Other Tasks. We Understand They Are Multi-Tasking  But They Should Have At Least Made Eye Contact And Been Polite.,,,,,

,87,Ashlie Was Just Wonderful - Informative  Helpful  Patient. Whole Front Desk Was Very Cheery And Welcoming Upon Arrival As Well.

Ashlie Was The Other Member Of The Team Who Particularly Shone. She Was So Relaxed And Comfortable Within Herself  Quietly Confident Of Her Capabilities  Appeared Proud Of And To Be Working At Bovey Castle.  Thank You.  Nb:  You Can Put An Expensive Uniform On A Person But That Person Has To Shine Through To Complete The Picture.,,,,,
,161,Staff Were Variable.  Reception Staff Were Excellent  But Service For Afternoon Tea Was Less So. The Girl Never Came Back To Ask If Everything Was In Order  We Had To Go To Find Her To Get Hot Water And Finally Ended Up Finding A Barman So We Could Settle The Bill.,,,,,

,186,The Car Parking Staff Were By Far The Most Enjoyable Staff To Meet.   They Were Polite  Knew One's Name  And Were Always Cheerful.   Sadly This Attitude Did Not Prevail Throughout The Hotel.,,,,,

,293,Every One Was Just So Helpfull Did Not Have Any Problems At All,,,,,
,294,Rachael Who Organised Our Dining The 1St Night In The Catherdral Room  As The Bistro Lacked Evening Atmosphere And Was Pretty Souless For An Evening Venue.  I Felt That The Bistro Was More Suitable For Day Time Dining After A Round Of Golf Or On A Day Spa Visit.,,,,,
,295,The Waitress Who Laid A Cloth On The 'Poof' By The Fire In The Lounge And Brought The Lovely Celeriac Soup And Bread And Drinks. Excellent!,,,,,

,333,All Were Really Nice  The Room Tidy When We At Diner Was A Lovely Touch - The Bistro Was Busy And Everything Felt A Bit Rushed.,,,,,
,334,Matt At The Reception / Front Door. He Was Particularly Polite/Friendly/Efficient And I Remarked To My Daughter That He Was A 'Really Good Member Of Staff'.

,336,The Lady Who Showed Us To Our Room  And Appeared To Be In Charge Of The Other Staff Was Very Warm  Welcoming And Helpful (Although Unfortunately I Can't Recall Her Name),,,,,
,338,The Head Of The Breakfast Team (First Three Days) Should Over Think His Job. The A La Carte Breakfast Takes Much To Long. And There Was No 'Sorry'.,,,,,
,340,Thought The Reception Staff Especially Felicity Were Extremely Polite And Nothing Seemed To Much To Ask. Excellent Service.  The Staff Who Look After The Cars And Parking Were Also Extremely Helpful.,,,,,
,342,Sarah On Reception Went Out Of Her Way To Make Our Weekend Special (We Got Engaged During Our Stay) . The Bar Manager (Sorry - I Do Not Know His Name - Tall With Silvering Hair) Was Very Helpful And Such A Gentleman .,,,,,
,343,One Of The Waiters Was Particularly Helpful And Professional With A Warm Manner - An Older Gentalman Possibly Italian - His Assistance With Arranging A Birthday Cake After Our Meal And Offering To Take A Couple Of Family Photographs Was Much Appreciated.  This Was Not The Waiter With Whome There Was A Personal Hygiene Issue.,,,,,

,351,The Manager Was Very Polite And Pleasant.,,,,,
,353,Ashley Was Very Helpful When We Arrived And Showed Us Round. Also The Barman In The Oak Bar Was Very Attentive And Always Checked That We Didnt Need For Anything.,,,,,
,355,Two Young Men On Door Duty And Reception Team Generally,,,,,
,356,See Q8,,,,,
,358,All Staff Were Very Good. However We Had To Seek Out Staff To Order Drinks In The Late Afternoon And We Felt The Oak Bar Was Understaffed In The Evening.,,,,,
,359,They Were All Very Nice And Polite And Friendly,,,,,
,362,The Weather Was Atrocious And The Doorman Was Getting Wet But He Remained Cheerful And Helpful.,,,,,
,365,The Concierge Chaps And The Chap From Surrey Who Works In The Bar Were Very Good.,,,,,
,367,Ben Was Fantastic And Gave Us An Excellent Guided Tour  Welcoming Us And Making Us Feel At Home.  He Remembered Our Names And Was Truly Brilliant At What He Does - A Credit To The Team!

,370,All Staff We Met Were Very Friendly And Helpful.  Special Mention To The French Waiter (Sorry I Don't Know His Name) Who Was Working On Tuesday Evening In The Edwardian Restaurant As He Was Particularly Helpful  Very Friendly And Knowlegeable And A Great Asset To Your Restaurant.,,,,,

,379,All The Staff Were Excellent  Especially Frederico,,,,,
,382,Thought Fredrico Was Excellent - Also Rachel  Craig  Adam And The Restaurant Manager And Young Sommeliers,,,,,
,386,The Staff Were All Very Good. The Only Disappointment Was When We Tried To Book For Fly Fishing We Were Told They Would Get Back To Us And Didn't. The Staff In The Morning Had No Knowledge Of This So We Had To Repeat The Request.,,,,,
,387,Maxime One Of The Server From The Grill And The Reception Staff Who Were Really Professional And Helpful In A Very Nice Way. The Archery Professional Was Also Very Helpful And Good At What He Was Doing.,,,,,
,388,Were Disappointed By Employee Driving Jaguar  Who Daily Arrived Bovey Castle Ca. 8:30 A.M.  Speeding Over Grounds And Endangering Hotel Guests Walking Their Dogs!,,,,,

,392,The Manager  Mr. Aresti Was Friendly And Very Nice  But Everyone Else In The Team Was Excellent Too.,,,,,
,393,The Two Ladies Who Seemed In Charge Of The Bistro On Different Evenings Were Very Good And Kept Things 'In Order'. Also One Of The Ladies Who Does The Cleaning (Door Furniture Etc) In The Hall From Bistro To Reception (Circa 10:00) Was Unfailingly Nice And Friendly - Sometimes The 'Lower' Staff Members Can Make The Difference  She Did.,,,,,
,395,David The Restaurant Manager/Sommelier (Not Quite Sure Of His Title) - He Has A Very Nice Manner And A Genuinely Helpful Approach.  Chris Who Did Archery And Air Rifles With My Son.  Federico For Sorting Out The Disappointing Dining Experience In The Grill.  I Was Impressed By His Willingness To Take Responsibility  Apologise And Fix It For The Next Time. Is 3 Candles A Code By Any Chance?,,,,,
,397,In General Most Were Attentive In A Relaxed And Friendly Way. However Better Leadership And Input For The Team In The Bistro Would Make It A Better Place. The Gentleman Who Took Us For The Hens And The Look At A Lodge And To My Eternal Shame I Have Forgotten His Name  He Was Excellent,,,,,

,406,See Above Comments About Manager  Bar And Edwardian Grill Staff. Would Also Like To Thank The Person Who Showed Us Round On Arrival.,,,,,
,408,Unfortunately Do Not Recall Names. However The 'Porters' (Please Forgive The Term) Were Great At Meet & Great And Were A Pleasure To See - Great Service. Also In Bistro (Despite Service Comments) One Young Lady Stood Out And I Believe Sarah Is The Name - But At Least Whilst We Where There She Was The Only Female So Hopefully Identifiable. She Gets A Mention As She  In My Opinion  Went The Extra Metre And Was Professionally Friendly  Courteous And Informative.,,,,,
,413,The Young Night Porter  I Missed His Name  Was Very Helpful And Curteous.,,,,,
,414,The Team Was Really Lovely- John Even Came To The Room And Removed A Tick From My Dog That He Picked Up On A Walk. Amy Was Delightful On Our Walk Through The Moors And Our Daughters Enjoyed The Survival Course With Her As Well.,,,,,
,415,I Thought The Calm Tall Bespactled Chap Who Took Us To The Room Was Excellent And Saw Him In Action With Other Guests Too. Rest Generally Seemed A Bit Under Trained/In Controlled Panic Mode Ie Trying Too Hard Which Just Makes You Nervous As A Guest.,,,,,
,418,Criag - For Fantastic Reception And The Cider Tour; And Also Ironiclaly The Ladty Who Served In The Bistro On Our First Night Monday 22Nd Oct - Who Was Tremendous In Difficuklt Circumstances ( Undercooked Fish All Round And Only Having 1 Other Member Of Satff To Service The Whole Restaurant),,,,,
,420,Restaurant Maitre De',,,,,

,436,All Good From The Golf Shop To The Housekeeping Staff; With The Exception Of The Bar Staff Who Provided Drinks Menus And Failed To Return To Take Orders  Who Failed To Check The 'Outer Lounges'  Necessitating A Visit To The Bar To Order Drinks  Who Got Orders Wrong And Who Failed To Understand That A Cream Tea Requires The Food And Beverage To Be Served At The Same Time Rather Than 15 Minutes Apart.  Staff Were Found Chatting In The Bar And We Had To Ask For 'Nibbles' As They Were Never Offered. (This Does Not Apply To All Staff But Is A General Comment Of The Experience Over Three Evenings.,,,,,
,437,Ashlie Was Great. Sultan Was Terrific.,,,,,
,440,Restaurant Manager As Mentioned Earlier - Professional And Personable,,,,,
,442,The Manager  Frederico Faresti Who Acknowledged My Concerns Prior To The Wedding And Made Sure That The Day Ran As Smoothly As Humanly Possible. Thank You.,,,,,
,443,The Hotel Manager Is Superb  His Kindness And Attention Were Much Appreciated. The Younger French(?) Waiter Was Particularly Efficient  And Should Go Far In The Trade.  The Maitre D'hotel Was A Pleasure To Observe  With His Calm But Fast Paced Efficiency. The Receptionist  Kerry  Who Sorted Out Our Bedroom Move Was Very Patient.  We Were Impressed By A 'Bubbly' Dark Haired Waitress Who Was Very Pleasant.,,,,,
,445,Everyone We Met Was Very Helpful.,,,,,
,449,It Would Be Difficult To Single Out A Member Of The Team - All Staff Were Very Attentive And Helpful  From The Reception/Activities Team Through To The Bar And Restaurant Team - All Exceptional,,,,,
,451,Adam  Who We Met On The Cider Making Experience Was Extremely Friendly And Informative,,,,,
,455,No  All Were Of An Exceptional Standard  Being Very Helpful And Pleasant.,,,,,
,456,No - All Were Very Courteous.,,,,,
,460,Everyone Was Excellent Except The Bar Staff In The Bistro Who Wee Grumpy,,,,,
,465,My Kids Loved The Egg Collecting And Petting The Ferrets And Have Done It A Few Times  But Came Back From The Morning Of Tuesday 30Th October Very Disappointed As The Member Of Staff Who Led It  Seemed To Be Unwilling To Let Them Handle The Ferrets (Which They Had Handled The Previous Day) Or Spend Much Time With The Chickens - The Whole Expereince Was Over In A Flash. My Son's Egg That He Had Collected Was Then Thrown On The Floor By The Member Of Staff  Which Upset Him - Although I Explained That This Was To Feed The Chickens  But He Wanted To Take The Egg Home As He Had Done Before.  I Only Mention This Because It Was  Most Unlike The Other Times When They Had Really Enjoyed This Experience.  I The Grand Scheme Of Things It's Not A Disaster  But It Seemed Most Out Of Character For The Bovey Experience.,,,,,
,467,There Was A Blonde Girl Who Had Only Been At The Castle A Few Days Doing The Meet And Greet By Reception Who We Liked A Lot. I Don't Remember Her Name But We Visited At The End Of July- Hopefully You May Be Able To Check Your Records To See Who She Is?,,,,,

,477,Everyone Was Amazing.,,,,,
,484,The Ladies On Reception Were Very Helpful With Getting My Sister's Baby's Bottle Sterilised Each Morning And Evening. There Was A Very Friendly Waiter Who Was Working In The Edwardian Grill On The Friday Evening Who Got Some Colouring Pencils And Paper For My Niece - Can't Remember His Name  But He Had Dark Hair.,,,,,
,486,Young French Guy At Afternoon Tea And In The Grill Was Very Good.,,,,,
,488,As Previously  I Felt Like I Was An Additional Hassle And The Group You Were Hosting Were The Important Ones,,,,,

,491,We Really Appreciated The Help Of Your (Male) Sommelier And The Friendliness & Professionalism Of Your Bar Tender/Manager (Tall Man).,,,,,
,493,Everyone Did A Wonderful Job,,,,,
,497,Due To The Crowded And Noisy Evening Wedding Reception We Looked To Take Our Food Elsewhere To Allow Us To Talk To Family Members We See Very Rarely.  We Were Rudely Told That We Were Unable To Eat The Food In The Bar Area  Which Was Not Busy  And Where We Had Already Purchased Drinks.  Given That We Were All Staying In The Hotel  And Not Just Guests At The Wedding  It Seemed Reasonable That We Should Have Been Able To Make Use Of All The Facilities You Had On Offer  Not Just Those Provided For The Wedding.,,,,,
,502,Federico Was Excellent And Asked Us Questions About Our Stay And The Rugby - When He Found Out It Had Been My Birthday The Night Before He Sent Over Complimentary Glasses Of Champagne Which Made The Evening Even More Enjoyable.,,,,,
,509,The Standards Varied Significantly. Overall Staff Were Courteous And Some Went Above And Beyond To Help.  Others Simply Did Not,,,,,
,512,Suzanne In The Playbarn,,,,,
,515,No But I Thought All The Staff Were Very Good. The New Guy On The Bar In The Oak Room Was Very Friendly And Down To Earth,,,,,

,548,There Was A Young Chap (Name I Cannot Recall Unfortunately) Who Was Working In The Bistro On The Friday Night (8Th March) And The Saturday Night As Well; He Was Also Working In The Oak Bar On The Saturday Evening. He Was Extremely Polite  Friendly And Courteous And Also Offered His Own Considered Insight In To What Food We Should Choose. He Was Also Kind Enough To Take Our Desserts To Our Room. Really Pleasant To See Bearing In Mind I Come From And Live In London And Such Qualities Are Not That Forthcoming Nowadays. Please Pass On Our Regards To Him If You Know Whom I Am Referring To.,,,,,
,550,Receptionists Were Very Friendly And Helpful As Were The Men Who Worked Dealing With The Car Parking.,,,,,
,558,Not Sure Of His Name But He Has Curly Blonde/Red Hair. He Helped Get Rid Of A Spider In My Room At About 2 Am In The Morning!,,,,,
,561,The Waitress's Were Incredibly Rude When We Complained About The Poor Dining Service And Tried To Argue The Money Off. One Man In The Main Bar Refused To Serve Me A Glass Of Water And Tried To Ask Me To Go To Another Bar To Get It Even Though He Was Currently Not Serving!,,,,,
,575,Richard And His Team Were Fantastic In Making The Golf Day A Great And Well Managed Event. As Was The Chef Who Did The Bbq And Also Our Event Meal Along With The Front Of House Staff Especial The Lady Who Managed Them (Who's Name I Have Forgotten). The Bar Manager In The Bistro Who Had To Deal With Our Demanding And Thirsty Clients.   I Have To Say Right From The Start From Dealing With Sally The Event Team (Polly) Bar Staff  The Young Lady Who Was Freezing In The Half Way House  To Final Check Out The Staff Are A Credit To Your Hotel. ,,,,,
,582,Craig And The Girls On The Front Desk Could Not Have Been More Polite  Efficient Or Friendly. Really Nice Young Guy In A Suit In The Bistro Was Also Great.  The Car Park Guy Could Have Been A Little More Polite As Mentioned. Also When We Had Breakfast  The Waiter Wasnt Very Helpful And Left Us Standing Confused For A While In The Restaurant As If We Werent Supposed To Be There  Or That It Was Too Much Trouble For Him.  We Went Shooting With Ian  And This Was A Great Experience For All  Fantastic Advice And Really Fun. I Would Strongly Recommend Him And Bovey Castle Activities As A Result. All In All A Really Wonderful Weekend And A Few Hiccups Wouldnt Stop Me Recommending It Or Returning ! Many Thanks To A Fantastic Team.,,,,,
,585,Adam,,,,,
,587,The Babysitter Provided  Tracy  Was Absolutely Wonderful.  Our Daughter Immediately Settled In With Her Allowing Us To Go Out Immediately.  We Would Highly Recommend Her To Anyone Wanting To Use Your Babysitting Service And Hope To Be Able To Book Her On Our Next Visit.,,,,,
,591,Federico Is Great  Always Checking The Guests Are Ok And Is Very Personable.  Also We Had A Lovely Lady Who Looked After Us And Our Dog Pepper At Tea But Unfortunately I Cant Remember Her Nameâ€¦.. Sorry But She Was Fab. As A Negative A Couple Of The Waiters Were Pretty Slow - We Did Wait A Long Time For Dinner In The Edwardian Grill And Then Felt Obliged To Pay The 12.5% Service Charge That Is Added To Everything!!,,,,,
,593,Debbie(?) Did An Excellent Indian Head Massage.,,,,,
,594,The Most Outstanding Feature Of Bovey For Me Was The Staff: From Federico Down Everyone Worked As A Team To Make Sure That We Had The Best Christmas Possible.  I Was Struck By The Fact That Staff  Although Being Paid  Were Giving Up Time With Their Own Families Over Christmas To Serve Us  And Yet Everyone Was Really Cheerful And Professional.  The Staff Is Amazing - A Real Strength.,,,,,
,596,The Barman Who Lives In Woodbury Was Excellent As Was The Blonde Lady On Reception (Sorry Don't Remember Names) The Big Let Down Again Were The Grill Staff  Not The Head Waiter But I Would Say All Of The Others,,,,,
,597,The Chef In The Bistro Was Very Friendly And Professional And Clearly Is Passionate About The Food He Delivers.,,,,,

,599,The Lady In The Bistro Cafe Was Excellent - Very Friendly And Ready For A Chat - We Enjoyed Speaking With Her And She Always Acknowledge Us In The Hallways. Sorry I Don't Know Her Name But She Had Dark Hair And Glasses - Also On Sunday We Did The Cider Making And The Young Lad Make The Experience Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,601,Several!  Federico  Ashliee And The Team In The Oak Bar For Looking After Us And Taz The 3 Legged Lab So Well.,,,,,

,611,Some Excellent Service From A Young  Red-Haired Englishwoman Who Often Worked At Resort Activities Desk.  Also From A Young Woman From Eastern Europe With Dark Hair Who Served Tea In The Fireplace Rooms.  And We Really Enjoyed The Clay Pigeon Shooting With Ian.  Thank You To Those Individuals!,,,,,

,624,The Manager Was A Bit Too Intrusive,,,,,
,637,The Dining Staff In The Edwardian Were Very Good. We Were Particularly Impressed With The Young Lady Who Brought The Cheese Board. Her Knowledge Of All Of Them (And There Were Many) Was Exceptional Within A Short Time And Her Service Was Brilliant  The Right Balance Of Friendly And Courteous.,,,,,
,638,None Whatsoever.,,,,,

,652,Without Exception All The Staff We Met During Our Stay Were Welcoming And Helpful.  A Special Thank You To Whoever Had The Job Of Emptying Our Jam Packed Car On Arrival And For Popping The Chilled Food In The Fridge.  Also The Chaps In The Golf Shop Were Exceptionally Helpful As Always; Running Us Out In A Buggy So That We Could Do The Second Half Of The Course And For Their Neverending Patience In Advising Us Of The Quietest Times To Play (We're Not The Fastest Golfers In The World!),,,,,
,653,The Staff I Met Were All Very Welcoming And Helpful As Always.  I Had 2 Golf Lessons With Dan Which Which Were Both Excellent.,,,,,

,702,All Of The Staff Were Very Good.,,,,,
,703,The General Manager Federico  Always In The Right Place At The Right Time And An Absolute Credit To The Hotel And The Company Behind It.  The Other Staff Were All Very Professional Too (Again Craig Who I Think Was Based In The Gym Area As He Said To Me He Would Run Upstairs And Have A Word With The Spa People) Also Deserves Real Credit For Helping Me Salvage The Spa Booking For My Wife (As Mentioed Previously).,,,,,
,704,The Staff Could Not Have Been Nicer Or More Friendly.,,,,,
,705,We Had A Great Walk With Ben. Craig Was Good With Our Boys For The Archery. Karina Ws Kind When It Came To Beaky.,,,,,
,706,George The Sommelier As Previously Mentioned And Federico The Hotel Manager Was Superb  Very Welcoming And Friendly.,,,,,
,711,The Manager - Was Incredibly Hard Working And Professional - The Other Staff Not Necessarily Up To His Standards. The Kids Liked Ben.,,,,,
,713,Your Hungarian Sommelier Was Very Pleasant And Perhaps You Should Consider A Tour Of Your Wine Cellars If You Do Not Already As I Know I Would Have Been Interested And I Know Of Another Couple Who Will Be Visiting In May That Would Be Very Interested. On Departure We Found That A Return Limo Trip To The Airport (Exeter) Had Been Added To The Bill And I Did Ask For A Price Prior To Travel But Never Asked For It To Be Booked. In Fact I Had Made Arrangements With Capital In Exeter Myself. I Advised The Reception Team Who Were Rather Sceptical And Kept Mentioning They Must Have Made The Booking For A Reason But They Did Remove It From The Bill And Cancelled It. I Felt Sorry For The Limo Driver As He Lost A Job Even Though I Had Not Booked One In. This Clearly Irked One Member Of Reception Staff In Particular Who Seemed The Most Senior But I Had Not Asked For The Booking Just A Price.,,,,,
,715,Ashleigh  As Previously Mentioned.,,,,,

,732,The Staff In The Castle Bistro.  Excellent!!!,,,,,
,735,The Ladies At The Reception And The Men Carrying The Luggage.,,,,,
,744,Without Exception  The Staff We Met Were (As Usual) All Very Helpful.,,,,,
,746,All Staff From Arrival  To The Restuarants And Bars Were Very Informative And Helpful. I Was Less Impressed With Reception Sitting Down While They Were Talking To The Guests? A Little Unprofessional?,,,,,
,759,Most Staff Were Excellent; However  There Was Always One Or Two That Were Not!,,,,,
,762,Reception Staff Were Very Pleasant And Helpful. Not All Of The Restaurant Staff Were.,,,,,
,772,The Duty Manager On The Evening Of Sunday September 30Th Did His Best.,,,,,
,773,Didn't Have Much Cotnact With The Staff  But All Were Polite And Said 'Hello'. Very Impressed That The Groundsman/ Gardener I Passed One Morning Was Equally Friendly  Helpful And Polite. A Very Good Team!,,,,,
,774,Do Not Remember Names  Italian Guy  Looked Like The Manager. Very Attentive  Polite And Keen To Provide Good Service,,,,,
,777,All Made Us Feel Very Welcome.,,,,,
,778,Katarina And Ben . Ben Was Excellent   Enthusiastic And Great Fun And Extremely Polite And Courteous.,,,,,
,781,All Staff Were Amazing. Raol Was Great To Accommodate Last Minute Changes For Our Lunch  And Rebecca Worked Well With Me To Ensure The Archery And Whole Experience Ran Smoothly,,,,,
,782,There Was A Young Man  I Think His Name Is Michael Who Greeted Us Upon Arrival And Unloaded The Car.  We Saw Him During The Stay Too And Each Time He Was Very Friendly And Attentive.,,,,,
,784,The Manager Was Great And Reception Staff Also Good.,,,,,
,785,My Wife A Her Friend Went To The Bistro For A Coffee And Half A Beer.. After 20 Mins No Drinks Then After 40 Mins No Drinks . Waitress Said There Was A Problem With The Milk But Still Did Not Bring The Beer After 45 Mins My Wife Cancelled The Order And Decided We Would Not Eat In The Bistro That Evening As The Experience Had Annoyed Them Both As They Has A Break With No Kids A Fancied A Drink.. I Got The Impression That The Person Serving Them Was Not Really Switched On To Their Needs.,,,,,
,787,This Is Your Strong Point,,,,,
,788,The Staff And Service Was Truly Outstanding.  A Special Thanks To Matt  Who Organized Several Events For Our Kids And Addressed A Problem With Our Rental Car.  He Made Our Stay Truly Outstanding.  A Thanks Also To Asher (Sp?) Who Was Kind Enough To Change A Flat On Our Rental Car And Did So With Good Spirits.  Really Thought The Service Was Exceptional.,,,,,
,789,Federico Really Went Out Of His Way To Make Us Feel Welcome,,,,,
,793,I Think The Manager On Duty - Sorry Can't Remember Name. Very Friendly  Attentive And Helpful At All Times Especially When Locked Out Of Room,,,,,
,794,It Would Be Unfair To Single Out One Individual As We Found All Staff To Be Friendly And Professional.,,,,,
,795,We Feel The Staff Are What Make Bovey Castle Special. We Would Go Back For That Reason.,,,,,
,802,They Were All Very Good.,,,,,
,803,Can't Remember Her Name (Kim  Perhaps?)   But The Lady In The Spa Who Did Both My Manicure And Pedicure. Very Sweet  Attentive And Probably The Best Treatments I've Ever Had. They Also Managed To Squeeze In An Appointment For Me At My Preferred Time When They Had Been Fully Booked. Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,804,The Lady On Reception Who Did Our Check In - Was Very Friendly & Helpful Throughout. Martin Whitley Was Fantastic  We Watched His Displays Every Morning.,,,,,
,807,Sorry Do Not Know His Name But The Tall Chap Who Met Us At The Entrance Is His Plus Fours And Green Tarten Waistcoat Etc Was Very Attentive And Deserves A Special Mention. Nothing Was Too Much Trouble,,,,,
,809,Chris Was Great With My Kids At Archery,,,,,
,812,All Staff Encountered Other Than In The Grill  Should Be Commended  I'm Afraid I Cannot Remember Any Names. In The Grill  There Were Maybe 2 Members Of Team Who Were Ok  But The Rest...,,,,,
,822,Kim In The Spa Was Particularly Good And Pleasant,,,,,
,825,I Agree Strongly To The Above Except For The Staff In The Bistro Which I Would Mark As Strongly Disagree,,,,,
,830,Yes The Chap Who Picked Us Up From The Pub Who Was In The Navy And Comes From Wales  A Real Asset To Bovey Castle,,,,,
,832,Federico Is Excellent  You See Him All Over The Hotel And He Deals With Issues Before They Become Problems. He Dealt With Our Room Issue Swiftly Without Fuss And Our Experience Was Therefore Unaffected.,,,,,
,833,All Of Them.  Can't Fault Your Staff To Be Honest.  More Polite And Attentive Than Claridges!,,,,,
,835,Martin The Falconer Was Very Entertaining  No Individual Stands Out All Friendly And Charming  Just One Or Two Of Your Younger Edwardian Grill Team Rather Nervous,,,,,
,836,Barbara In The Castle Grill Was Very Competent When I Advised That A Couple Of Drinks Had Incorrectly Been Added To My Bill In Error. I Was Surprised To Learn That She Was New To The Hotel.,,,,,
,841,The Member Fo Staff Who Led The Archery. He Was Helpful  Informative And Helped Us Get The Best From The Session. The Other Member Was The New Girl In The Bistro  She Was Cheerful  Happy To Be Busy And Even When We Saw Her Other Times In Our Visit She Was Smiling And Happy.,,,,,
,842,My Two Boys Thought Ossian Was Very Good,,,,,
,843,Fed Is A Star,,,,,
,846,Adam  And The Bistro Ladies,,,,,
,848,All Were Excellent,,,,,
,852,Front Desk Staff Were Excellent.  Bellman Were Rude (Pompous Actually)- Especially In Their Efforts To Keep Us Out Of The Main Hotel Building Due To A Wedding,,,,,
,854,Remembering My Name And Not Haselling Me Over Parking And Getting Car Myself ( My Preference),,,,,
,865,Christopher As Mentioned Before And The Bar Staff,,,,,
,866,Federico Was Very Kind. Lucy Too.,,,,,
,867,Gm Was Omipresent,,,,,
,868,Harry Who Showed Us To The Lodge Was Very Good And Helpful,,,,,
,878,Raoul - Was Extremely Attentive And Supportive,,,,,
,885,The Reception Team Were Particularly Friendly  Attentive And Welcoming.,,,,,
,887,The Wedding Co-Ordinator Was Fantastic. Very Friendly And Made Every Effort To Answer Any Enquiries.   We Made Several Request At Reception For Items From Our Room To Be Transfered To Other Members Of The Families Rooms. This Was Eventually Carried Out After Repeating The Request At Reception Hours Later Or Asking A Different Member Of Staff.,,,,,
,893,Alex In The Oak Bar Was Particularly Friendly And It Was A Pleasure To Be Served By Him.  There Was One Person In The Bar On The Saturday Night Whom We Felt Quite Uncomfortable With.  He Didn't Seem To Want To Be There And We Had To Wait For 10 Minutes Before We Were Even Asked What We Would Like To Drink.  I Don't Know His Name  - Maybe Name Badges Would Be An Advantage In Being Able To Provide Constructive Comments.,,,,,
,894,Amy (?) The Bartender Was So Nice And Made An Excellent Hendricks Martini With Cucumber Slice.  Johnny From Romania In The Restaurant Was Very Personable And Knowledgeable About Food And Wine.  Good Conversation With All Of Your Staff.   Your Front Desk Person (Can't Remember) Switched Our Room For Us (Room Next To Elevator Was Very Bad) And She Was Very Nice.  I Would Hire Her.  Alex Who Handled Our Bags Was Very Nice As Well.  You Have A Great Staff There....Treat Them Well  Like They Treated Us!!  :),,,,,
,895,Yes The French Guy In The Main Restaurant. I Think Is Said He Is From Reunion,,,,,
,898,Jake Was Particularly Personable!,,,,,
,906,Front Desk Very Helpful And Bistro Staff Very Good.,,,,,
,907,The Somelier Spent Time Discussing Wine Choice For Our Meal. She Was Very Knowledgeable.,,,,,
,908,Left A Note For Wine To Be Chilled In Room On Second Night (As Did Not Drink It First Night) Note Was Taken And Request Ignored,,,,,
,910,The Scoring Would Have Been Much Higher Had It Not Been For The Restaurant Manager.  The Hotel Manager Once We Had Complained Was Extremely Courteous And Pleasant.,,,,,
,914,My Amswers To 19 Depend Which Members Of Teh Team You Mean.  I Thought The Bovey Rangers Were Good  And Two Senior Restaurant Staff (Eastern European Lady/Somellier And English Lady - Rachael? - ) Were Very Good  But The Less Senior Restaurant Staff In The Edwardian Restaurant Were A Little Less Convincing.  They Came Across As Quite Junior  And Not As Focussed On Communication/Service.  I Didn't Have Any Particularly Bad Experiences  This Is More Impressionistic,,,,,
,918,Quality Of Service Is A Real Strength At Bovey Castle,,,,,
,919,Rita At The Spa.   * I Would Have Ticked 'Strongly Agree' For Question 19 But The Golf Experience Did Not Come Close To The Levels Of Politeness  Attentiveness And 'Feeling At Home' That Was Shown By The Rest Of The Bovey Team.,,,,,
,920,The Activities Staff On Site Were Great And We All Enjoyed Their Company.  Thank You.  Oisan And Adam.,,,,,
,921,Service Is Slow For People Staying In The Lodges,,,,,
,925,Gentleman Looking After The Car And Doing Meet And Greet On Arrival,,,,,
,929,The Young Man Who Served Us In The Bistro On The Evening Of Thursday 21St March Was Incredibly Charming,,,,,
,931,All Staff Were Excellent,,,,,
,933,Frederico Was A Delight - Very Conscientious And Kind  Generous In Response When Something Was Not Quite Perfect. Every Top Class Establishment Needs Someone Like Him - Very Hands On  Checking And Supporting Staff  Attuned To The Needs And Expectations Of The Guests.,,,,,
,937,The Manager Fredrico  Always Very Hospitable And Pleased To You ,,,,,
,941,Both The Sommeliers We Dealt With Were Excellent.,,,,,
,965,The General Manager Was Superb,,,,,
,968,Cezar  As Mentioned.  Federico Aresti Is A Wonderful Hotel Manager.  In My Experience He Has Always Shown Great Interest In His Guests  Spends Time With You  And Makes You Feel Welcome And Valued.,,,,,
,969,The Italian Man From Sardinia Was Very Good At Welcoming Guests.,,,,,
,978,Matt  Who Greeted Me In The Car Park On Arrival - Excellent Customer Service And Ambassador For Bovey Castle A Female Member Of Staff  Slim  Long Blond Hair Also Gave Us Excellent Customer Service,,,,,
,983,Entire Staff Was Great,,,,,
,986,It Very Much Depended Who It Was. E.G. We Got Offered The Worsed Tennis Racketâ´S Iâ´D Ever Seen And One Tennis Ball...! I Stated In Advance That It Is Important To Us To Play Tennis And We Had Our Dresses With Us But Not Balls And Rackets As I Was Assured On The Telephone That Bovey Castle Is Good Equipped.  So After I Heared That There Were More Balls (What An Effort To Buy Some More ...) And Better Rackets Out I Asked At The Reception Whether We Could Reserve Them (No!) Or At Least Get A Note When They Would Come Back. We Never Got That Notice... Sorry For The Team Members Who Were Really Nice And Attentive..! I Had The Impression That Especially The Oneâ´S From Other Countries (Austrian Or French Waiter) Or Or Parts Of Country (E.G. The Nice Welsh Guy) Put Much More Effort Into Their Work Then Others..,,,,,
,987,Asked About Having A Falconry Seesion For Two On The Sunday.The Lady We Spoke With Said She Would Leave A Note In The Room About It.She Did Not We Had To Chase It Up Only To Learn It Was Not Possible.This In My Opinion Was Poor Service.Also Lost My Glasses In The Castle At The Time Phone Calls To Reception Were Not Returned And Actually Called Again From Home On Tuesday To See If They Had Been Found But No One Called Me Back.I Think Your Front Desk Is Slack.,,,,,
,991,Federico Who Was Everywhere And Very Efficient And Thoughtful  Ashley Very Professional And Helpful,,,,,
,997,Too Many To Mention The Husband And Wife Team From Wroclaw Who Worked In The Oak Bar And The Edwardian Restaurant Were Very Knowledgeable On Food.,,,,,
,998,I Will Mention Martin Again  Because Late At Night (After A Long Drive In Pouring Rain From Marlborough) He Was A Most Welcome Site At Your Front Door.  He Immediately Gave Us A Wonderful Impression Of Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,1000,Golf Staff,,,,,
,1001,The Manager  Fedrico. All The Staff Were Impressive By Their Politeness.,,,,,
,1004,The Duty Manager Was Very Helpful . There Was No Heating On Our Bathroom And The Towel Rail Did Not Work So The Room Was Cold. He Arranged To Have It Checked Straightaway  And When They Realised The Floor Would Have To Be Lifted He Moved Us To Another Room The Next Day. It Was Done Politely And Without Fuss  And He Checked With Us That We Were Happy.,,,,,
,1007,Federico Was Clearly Very Engaged In Helping Our Party And Was Great.  Rita (I Think) Was Lovely And Her Reflexology Session Was Marvelous.,,,,,
,1008,When We Checked In At 7:00 Our Er Concierge Was Not There. Your Staff Did A Great Job Getting Us Settled Into Our Lodge.,,,,,
,1009,Rachael Was Very Helpful On Our 1St Night As We Had Planned To Eat In The Castle Bistro  Which Appeared Souless.  She Organised The Bistro Menu To Be Served In The Main Lounge.,,,,,
,1011,Everybody Was Very Friendly,,,,,
,1015,The Young Man Who Took The Archery,,,,,
,1016,Craig - Loved The Walk .. Professional And Tried Hard To Please.,,,,,
,1017,All Therapists Were Good,,,,,
,1021,The Spa Team (Rita) Excellent Communication Skills And Warmth.  All Reception Staff And Concierge,,,,,
,1023,They Were All Excellent Especially Those On The Front Desk And The People Who Helped With Access To And From The Hotel For Our Electric Disabled Buggy,,,,,
,1025,Fed And His Team Were All Wonderful And Made Our Stay So Enjoyable And Fun.,,,,,
,1027,Hotel Wedding Planner  Very Helpful To The Quests.,,,,,
,1028,Charlotte Greenwood I Wish To Acknowledge As Inappropriate Behavior On The Saturday Night.  Please Refer To Previous E Mail Sent With Details.  Thought The Falconer Was Fantastic. Reception Great Also.,,,,,
,1029,Reception And Staff Are Perfect  Breakfast Room In The Morning Were Not That Friendly At All.,,,,,
,1030,Acknowledge Is Probably Not The Right Word - I Was Amazed To Be Disturbed At 8.40Am Today By A Knock At The Door By A Member Of The Housekeeping Team Asking Is She Could Do The Room.  Surely The Housekeeing Records Showed I Was Due To Leave This Morning And In Any Event 8.40Am Is Far Too Early,,,,,
,1034,Q2 Only Relates To The Bar Staff  See Previous Comments. All Other Staff Were Very Attentive.,,,,,
,1039,The Men In Outdoor Tweeds & Plus Fours,,,,,
,1040,Presume The Team Here Is The Hotel Team And Not Just The Spa Team.  The Team At Breakfast Provided Poor Service Overall  Although Things Like Gluten Free Bread Were Much Appreciated  As Was Soya Milk Brought To The Bedroom Fridge - Thank You.,,,,,
,1041,No  We Were Only There For One Night (Two Days) And All Staff Were Very Helpful.,,,,,
,1043,Performance Of Staff Very Mixed. The Reception And Car Valets Were Good But The Food/ Hospitality Personnel Whilst Polite Did Not Put Guests' Needs First. The Pool Had Been Well-Used As A Sunday But Left In An Appalling State By Some Guests With Towels Discarded On The Floor Etc. - A Real Mess.,,,,,
,1047,The Only Member Of Your Staff Not Up To Scratch Was The Golf Manager/Staff Member On The Second Day Of Our Stay. Quite Indifferent And Not At All Polite.,,,,,
,1049,They Were All Equally Good,,,,,
,1055,Difficult To Differenciate Between Staff As From Arrival All Staff Were Courteous  Helpful And Professional Whilst Still Being Friendly  The Wish To Please And The Smiles.,,,,,
,1056,Hannah And Emily Provided Excellent Service And Were Friendly And Very Attentive To Our Every Request,,,,,
,1061,Yes They Were Great.  Mat On The Door And All Of The Ladies At Reception. The Lady Who Served Out Meal At Dinner Too. All Other Staff We Met.  Exceptions The Grill Bar At Breakfast Were Only Just Ok And The Lady In The Oak Bar She Wore A Grey Uniform ( The Surly One) Need A Bit Of Training!,,,,,
,1063,All The Team Were Very Good  In Particular The Housekeeping Staff. However  A Couple Of Members Of The Restaurant Team Were Much Too Pushy (In Spite Of Being Asked Not To Be) And This Somewhat Ruined What Would Otherwise Have Been A Very Good Experience.,,,,,
,1064,Very Much Enjoyed Falconry Display,,,,,
,1065,The Reception Girls Were Very Helpful,,,,,
,1069,No One In Particular As They Were All Very Good.,,,,,
,1075,The Whole Team Were Brilliant.,,,,,

,1100,Not Sure Of His Name But The Male Person Organising The Afternoon Event Was Very Helpful With The Wheel Chair That My Mum Was In She Is Elderly And They Were Very Helpful In Assisting And Moving The W/Chair Down Various Steps With A Couple Of Other Male Members Of Staff - Thank You For This !,,,,,
,1102,All The Staff We Had Dealings With Were A Credit To The Hotel. I Would Say The Friendliness Of The Staff And Their Obvious Aim To Please Guests Is The Outstanding Strength Of Your Hotel. It Is Difficult To Pick Out One Person As They Were All Excellent.,,,,,
,1103,Adam Gave Us A Good Tour Of The Hotel Facilities,,,,,
,1105,No,,,,,
,1107,The Staff  Who I Remember Are Lucy And Federiko Who Really Did A Great Job For Our Large Group With So Many Requests. Thank You For Taking Such Good Care Of Us. Also Sammy  (Not Sure Of The Spelling) Was Quite Helpful In Trying To Arrange A Booking For Us. Thank You.,,,,,
,1112,Osh And Ladd Were Both Very Friendly And Accommodating.  We Were Also Greeted Warmly By Several Members Of The Staff Any Time We Were In The Castle,,,,,
,1119,Ben Was Very Helpful And Polite As Were All The Staff. The Girls On The Reception Desk Were Very Helpful Too.Overall I Thought The Hotel Was Lovely And The Staff Very Attentive. It's Just The Breakfast And Main Restaurant That Lets You Down.,,,,,
,1123,Initial Greeter Who Did Showaround Was Excellent. Receptionist Staff Were Pleasant And Helpful.,,,,,
,1124,All Were Delighful,,,,,
,1128,We Felt That All The Staff Worked Well And As A Team We Felt Very Much At Ease.,,,,,
,1131,As Stated Earlier The Edwardian Grill Dinner The First Night Was The Exception To Otherwise Excellent Service.,,,,,
,1134,The After Dinner Coffee Arrangements Need Tightening - We Waited An Hour To Be Served And Then We Got Half A Cup Of Cold Strong Coffee And The Waiter Never Returned.,,,,,
,1139,Lauren Was Exceptionally Helpful And Welcoming.,,,,,
,1142,The Receptionists (Usually The Most Harassed And Defensive Members Of Staff) Deserve Special Mention For Their Friendly And Helpful Attitude.,,,,,

,1155,No But The Front Office People And The Porters Were Smiling And Attentive,,,,,
,1156,I Don't Know His Name  But The Young Man Who Waited On Us At Our Private Function.  He Was Friendly  Courteous Without Being Intrusive.,,,,,
,1162,No.,,,,,
,1165,Enjoyed Conversation With Your French Waiter From Reunion.   Everyone Very Helpful  Particularly Porters.,,,,,
,1167,Reception Girls And Tall Young Man Who Deals With Parking But They Were All Good,,,,,
,1169,Becka - For Her Calm Patience The Bistro Chef - For His Excellent Cooking And Introducing A 4-Year Old To The Delights Of Sole. Federico - Of Course!,,,,,
,1173,Becka In The Bistro Tried Hard In Difficult Circumstances,,,,,
,1175,Being Kind An Considerate Is Very Important  However  We Felt The Reception Staff Were Not Efficient And Seem To Be Chatting Amongst Themselves As If They Were At Party. Complimentary Drinks Were Included On The Bill And Embarrassingly I Had To Point This Out.,,,,,
,1178,Frederico  The Best! He Smoothed Out A Couple Of Glitches In Service  And Turned Them Into Very Good Experiences. Drivers Norman And David Were Excellent',,,,,
,1179,One Young Lady In The Restaurant Stood Out As Being Well Trained  Courteous And Efficient.,,,,,
,1184,The Driver Who Took Us To Town On Tuesday The 11Th Was Very Helpful And Friendly. All Those I Ran Into In My Room Were So Helpful. The Night Managers Were Great To Get Me Water And Then Another Night To Close My Window ...I Could Not Get It To Lock With The Wind Blowing So Hard.,,,,,
,1191,Everyone Was Delightful.,,,,,
,1196,Everyone Is Friendly And Attentive,,,,,
,1201,Alex Who Took Us For Cocktail Making And An Archery Class Was Great.,,,,,
,1205,Ended Up With Two Breakfasts Due To Limited Understanding Of Spoken English By The Waitress,,,,,
,1207,Adam And Resort Team Could Not Have Been More Helpful - Reception Staff Lovely Too As Was Manager,,,,,
,1209,The Level Of Caring And Compassion Were Beyond Any I Had Ever Experienced Anywhere.  Having Experienced Back Problems  I Was Especially Appreciative And Touched By All The Caring That Was Demonstrated To Me.  I So Very Grateful.  I Was Especially Moved By The Caring And Compassion That Several People Demonstrated Towards Me ... Including Vicky  Ocian  Felicity  Sammy (Samantha) And Jeremy ... And I Could Go On!   Ashley Too Was So Kind!  Thank You All!,,,,,
,1216,Genaro And Mark Were Excellent. Also A Mention For George And The Estonian Lady Whose Name I Forget. Also We Thought Thst Beaky Added Much To The Ambience.,,,,,
,1219,The Gentleman Who Served Me And My Partner At Our Meal  His Knowledge Of The Menu Was Outstanding  His Recommendations Were Fantastic And At No Point Was There Any Element Of A Sales Pitch. He Truly Wanted Us To Have A Fantastic Evening And We Did.,,,,,
,1223,Sally Lemar Was Exceptional In Helping Me In The Booking Process And I Thank Her For That.  Despite My Changing Of Dates On More Than One Occasion; Sally Was Fexilble  Extremely Polite And Entirely Professional Throughout My Correspondence.,,,,,

,1227,All The Team Were Friendly  Welcoming And Professional At All Times And Carry Out Their Job Very Well.

,1229,Alex Was Always Very Helpful To Us  And We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Activites With Him (Archery  Walks In The Moor).,,,,,
,1236,Difficult To Pinpoint Any Particular Member Of Your Team As They Were All Very Professional.  Your Training Is Excellent.  A Point I Would Like To Make Is That They All Seem To Enjoy Working At Bovey Castle And Really Care About The Hotel.  Even Though They Were Busy They Still Smiled - In Contrast To Another Visit We Had Made In Cornwall.,,,,,
,1237,Matt (Concierge). Very Professional  Affable And Seemed Genuinely Interested In Ensuring That Our Experience Was A Positive One Throughout Our Stay.  Also  A Lady Whose Name I Did Not Catch But She Showed Us The Chickens On Monday Morning. For Me She Just Seemed To Fit In Well At The Hotel. Calm  Collected And Seemingly Happy Every Time I Saw Her Over The Weekend. An Ambassador!  I Also Found The Restaurant Manager Very Knowledgeable  Interested And Committed To Delivery.  I Also Liked Fredrico's Comment About Martin's Eagle Being A Chicken In Funny Feathers - Very Funny!,,,,,

,1255,Alex The Bar Man Was Exceptional. Welcoming And Entertaining And I Will Certainly Be Recommending His Cocktail Learning Session To My Friends. The Other Bar Staff Were Brilliant Too But Unfortunately We Didn't Get Their Names (One Of Them Were Hungarian). The Restaurant Staff Were Excellent Too - I Think The One We Chatted To Was The Manager And She Was Exceptional  Polite  Humorous And Friendly.,,,,,
,1256,Sam The Young Barman In The Oak Bar Deserves A Particular Mention  His Passion For His Chosen Art (Cocktails!) Shines Through - He Does You Credit!,,,,,
,1258,Samuel In Particular Was Superb During Our Visit Attentive But Not Obtrusive. All Reception Staff,,,,,

,1270,The Manager - Was Great Very Personal And Approachable - Great.  The Reception Ladies Were All Lovely.  But To Be Honest Everyone Was Nice,,,,,
,1271,The 'Meet & Greet Staff' Were Very Attentive  Perhaps This Showed Up The Lack Of Service Provided In The Bar/Restaurant Areas Were The Staff Were Not As Attentive. The Lady With Long Blonde Hair Who Spoke To Us Several Times After Our Arrival Was Very Good  Believe She Possibly Worked On Reception/Main Office .,,,,,
,1272,Ashley Was Superb  She Spent A Lot Of Time With Us And Really Got To Know Us. She Makes You Feel  Really Quite Special  Her Service Felt Very Personal Indeed. There Were Several Of The Porter Chaps Who Helped When We Lost Our Car Keys  As Well As A Maintenance Man  Who Were Fantastic  But I'm Not Sure Of Any Of Their Names. I Thought All The Restaurant Staff Were Excellent  Especially With How They Coped With The Busy Breakfast Service  And There Was A Lovely  Friendly Welsh Porter Who Brought Our Bags To Our Room And Chatted With Us  As Well As Directing Us On Our Walk.,,,,,

,1678,Yes But Unfortunately I Did Not Take Their Names However As Usual Frederico Was Excellent In His Welcome And Attention Throughout Our Break,,,,,
,1680,The Waitress In The Bistro (16Th Nov Evening) Was Very Helpful And Pleasant  Especially When The Sticky Toffee Pudding Was Sad And The Amount Of Coffee In The Cup Was Almost Imperceptible.,,,,,
,1681,Craig And The Front Desk Staff.  Kids Really Enjoyed Archery And Survivial Skills.  Also Franceso And His Italian Colleague,,,,,
,1683,I Think The Castle Needs To Have All Staff Members Wear Name Tags So We Can Recognize And Associate A Name With A Face.  The Staff Was Again Great  Especially The Women Who Managed The Edwardian Grill At Breakfast  The Woman From Albania  And The Woman Who Helped Us At The Castle Bistro.,,,,,
,1685,Frederico  - Felt Like Part Of The Family,,,,,
,1693,Federico - Could Not Have Made Our Stay Any More Memorable Than He Did!! Great Hospitality.,,,,,
,1696,All Members Of The Team Were Excellent But I Would Like To Acknowledge In Particular The Senior Waiter Who Served Us Most (If Not All) Of Our Private Dining Evenings  The Cocktail Bar Steward Who Led The Cocktail Making Event  The Crolf And Archery Event Leader And The Somnelier Who Presented The Wine Tasting Event. All Of These People Helped To Make Our Stay Fun And Enjoyable.,,,,,

,1705,All Staff Were Excellent. Especially The Young Man Taking The Cider And Gin Tasting Evening,,,,,
,1706,Federico And Ashley Were Outstanding  Considerate  Pre-Empted Problems And A Credit To Bovey Castle.  Further  And Unfortunately I Didn't Catch Her Name  But The Lady Who (Was/Might Have Been?) In Charge Of The Caterers (With Fairly Short  Dark Hair  Who Directed The Waiters To The Tables During The Wedding Breakfast) Was Equally Impressive,,,,,
,1708,We Had A Mix Up With Luggage Being Taken To The Car On Exit (Our Part  Not Yours)  The Porters Were Quite Concerned That They Had Missed Our Need.,,,,,
,1709,Arpad Went Above And Beyond Multiple Times.,,,,,
,1710,Alex Who Ran The Cocktail Making Session Was Very Good-We All Enjoyed That Experience. Katie As Well Who Ran The Shooting Was Excellent. We All Also Found Martin's Falconry Display Very Interesting And Thoroughly Amusing. Federico Was Also Always Very Pleasant And Offered A Free Bottle Of Prosecco Which Was A Nice Gesture.,,,,,
,1711,We Love Louise  Who Was Bubbly And Friendly As Always. Federico Seemed To Take An Active Interest Us. Whether This Was Anything To Do With Our Hiccup On Arrival Or Not  I Don't Know However  That's Probably Irrelevant. I Always Took Every Opportunity To Speak To Federico Myself  And He Was Always Responsive & Chatty. It Is Always Nice To Be Recognised And Acknowledged (Whether From A Previous Stay Or Not) As It Makes You Feel Much More Welcome Than Just A Customer Passing Through.,,,,,
,1714,All The Staff Are Great. Kind  Interested And Attentive. Especially Fed Though!,,,,,
,1718,The Hotel Manager Knew About Us And Our Booking And Made Me Feel That He Was Genuinely Interested In Us And Our Stay At Ovey Castle.  Thankyou.,,,,,

,1726,Overall The Staff Were Very Friendly  Professional And Helpful And It Was Nice To Experience The 'No Problem' Mind Set If And When We Needed Anything.,,,,,
,1727,A Lady Who Saw Us Arrive Came Over To Us And Helped With The Cases  When I Think She Was En Route To Do Something Else..,,,,,
,1728,The Gents From The Pro Shop And The Two Ladies On The Reception.... I Asked If She Could Find Me A Set Of Bovey Castle Cuff Links And Because There Were None Available She Was Even Going To Lend Me Hers!!,,,,,

,1751,All Staff Were Curteous And Very Helpful But Lessons Need To Be Learned In The Edwardian Restaurant.  We Ate In There One Evening With Just Another Three Tables  Yet We Had To Pour Our Own Wine And Water Most Of The Time.,,,,,
,1752,Sorry  Didn't Take Much Notice Of The Name Tags But The Young Lady Waitress In The Bistro Was Forever  As Far As We Could See  Attending As Promptly And Efficeintly To Her Customers Throughout Her Shift.  She Appeared To Be Very Hard Working And Was Very Friendly.,,,,,
,1757,Adam Cornish - He Looked After Us All Weekend  And Never Seemed To Be Off Duty! He Was Polite  Courteous  Respectful And Discreet. Once He'd Checked Us In To Our Lodge  He Made A Courtesy Call Later On To Check If We Needed Anything.  More Generally I Was Very Impressed By The Way The Team At Bovey Were Able To Make Us Feel At Home  And Weren't Trying Unnecessarily Hard To 'Cut The Shine' Given The Exclusivity Of The Resort And The Clientele It Attracts. ,,,,,
,1766,Restaurant Manager Was Excellent But The Other Waiters Let Him Down.,,,,,
,1767,They Were All Very Kind And Helpfull.,,,,,
,1769,The Young Gentleman Who Met Us Asa We Arrived Was Very Attentive,,,,,

,1800,I Was Impressed By All The Staff. Their Level Of Social Skills And Professionalism Was Impressive And All Appeared To Want To Help When Needed. I Was Particularly Taken By The Lady With The Long Blond Hair In The Front Of House. She Was Very Efficient And By Returning The Money I Mislaid In The Bedroom Was Highly Commendable,,,,,
,1801,Oh Dear  I Cannot Remember Her Name. (I Think It Began With An 'A').   Was Her Position That Of Senior House-Keeper ?  She Had Spent Some Years In The Devonshire Arms At Bolton Abbey.  Anyhow  The Lady In Question Was Particularly Helpful With Regard To Our Changing Our Room.,,,,,

,1827,The Manager Of Course Who Runs An Excellent Team.,,,,,
,1831,The Lovely Black Guy (Really Sorry As We Didn't Catch His Name) Working In The Oak Room Bar.  Poor Man Was Missing A Lot Of Ingredients For Cocktails As The Hotel Had Had A Big Wedding The Day/Night Before.  He Was Very Apologetic And Did His Best.  He Didn't Need To Apologise So Much As We Totally Understood - But He Was So Willing To Please And Beautifully Polite And Attentive.,,,,,
,1832,They Were All Excellent.,,,,,
,1834,Julia Was Great  Gave Me A Welcome Tour And Showed Me Chiice Of Rooms- Made A Great Diffarence.  In The Dining Room  Max Was Very Proffessional.,,,,,

,1842,I'm Strongly Agreeing For Adam And Oschon Who Were Outstandingly Brilliant - I Was Not Impressed At All By Our Waitress In Bistro Or Our Breakfast Waitress,,,,,
,1843,All Apart From Grumpy Breakfast Waiter!,,,,,
,1847,I'm Afraid I Don't Know Their Names But The Two Therapists That Did Our Treatments Were Superb And A Credit To The Hotel. My Friend And I Would Highly Recommend Their Massages To Anyone  And My Other Friend Was Very Happy With Her Facial.,,,,,
,1848,I Would Like To Acknowledge The Lady That Provided Our Spa Treatment.  She Had To Cover Her Colleague That Didnt Come In And Provided One Of The Best Massage Treatments I've Ever Had At My Many Spas Visits.,,,,,

,1856,Frederico For Sorting Out The Issue With Night-Time Noise From The Kitchen Air-Conditioning (And Giving My Wife Earplugs To Block My Snoring!)  Melissa And Rachael For Looking After Us In The Edwardian  Oliver For Taking Us To The Cider-Making  And To Beaky For Muttering 'Bugger' Under His Breath...,,,,,
,1861,Matt For The Several Trips To The Car In The Rain He Had To Do To Get The Stuff I'd Forgotten  And The Lady At Reception Who Listened To The Fact I Was Going To Work Early The Next Morning  So Arranged For My Car To Be At The Front Ready Without Me Asking.,,,,,
,1864,Federico The Manager Led By Example  He Has High Expectations Of His Staff  And Is Very Hands On And Visible In The Hotel Chatting To Guests Etc. His Staff Clearly Respect Him  And Follow His Example. Also Verity  A Very Genuine  Lovely Girl  Who Showed Us The Lodges And Other Rooms  She Had Exactly The Right Attitude And Manner To Go Far In This Business  Such A Shame Shi Is Leaving.,,,,,
,1866,The Lady Who Showed Us Around The Hotel And To Our Room - I'm Sorry Can't Remember Her Name! She Had Long Blond Hair And Was So Very Helpful And Informative. Nothing Was Too Much For Her. Also Matt Shipton Who Did A Fabulous Job Of Introducing Us To Archery - Thank You Matt! Caesar In The Restaurant Was Exceptionally Professional At All Times  Helpful And Most Courteous. I Think He Is Also A Fabulous Role Model For His More Junior Staff Who I Hope Watch And Listen To Him. Frederico Too Was Most Attentive And Professional. He Responded Just As We Hoped When We Had A Strange Banging In The Early Hours Of Each Morning Which Woke Us Up. He Was Very Concerned And We Appreciated That He Took Our Comments So Positively - Hopefully You Got To The Bottom Of It Frederico!,,,,,

,1872,The Bistro Manageress Was Very Good And Despite The Poor Service/Food Quality That We Experienced On The Night We Left Feeling That It Was A One Off And We Would Return In The Future.,,,,,
,1874,The Guy Who Fetched And Parked The Car,,,,,
,1875,As Already Mentioned Our Waitress And The Bars Manager  But Everyone Had Real Enthusiasum And Priode In Their Place Of Work.,,,,,
,1877,The Lady On The Housekeeping Team Was Very Good -Sorted Out My Needs Twice But All Gave Exteremely Good Service,,,,,
,1879,No One Person In Particular. Everyone Made The Stay Etreamly Enjoyable.,,,,,
,1880,Ashley She Dealt With A Problem We Had With Professionalism And Efficiency Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Her And She Did Not Make Us Feel As If We Were Being A Nuisance.,,,,,
,1881,They Were All Equally Great,,,,,
,1883,The Staff Attending To My Daughter's Wedding Meal Were Superb And To Be Commended  Particularly The Man In Charge,,,,,

,1903,Amy - Resort Desk Instantly Stopped What She Was Doing And Helped Me Plan My Stay  Very Efficient And Welcoming. Oshan - Concierge He Was Fantastic At Welcoming Us Into The Hotel And Making Us Feel At Home Straight Away. Adam And Matt - Resort Team Had A Fantastic Round Of Archery And Air Rifle Shooting With Them And A Nice Freindly Chat. They Were Also Incredibly Helpful Around The Hotel. Craig - Resort Team He Made Cider And Sloe Gin Making Very Enjoyable And He Was Very Knowlegable With The Subject.  A Lady Who Seemed To Be Manager Of The Reception And Resort Team  She Was Also Very Welcoming And Showed Us Round When We Were A Bit Lossed And Was Very Freindly.  Everyone Else Who Served Us Was Fantastic  I Really Enjoyed My Stay Because Of This.,,,,,
,1907,Federico Aresti Was A True Gent  Very Socialable And Made Our Stay Even More Comforting. ,,,,,

,1919,The Bar Staff And The Staff In The Edwardian Grill Made Us Feel At Ease,,,,,
,1920,Without Exception  The Team Were Helpful  Polite  Friendly And Efficient. You Have An Exceptional Team And They Make The Experience At Bovey Castle Extremely Special. I Have Also Never Come Across A Hotel Manager Who Is So Visible And Accessible To His Guests. From Morning To Night Federico Was Present  Assisting Guests And Ensuring That Everyone Was Happy. The Team Made Our Stay Really Special - Thank You.,,,,,
,1922,Federico Of Course!!,,,,,
,1926,Federicco Introduced Himself And Seemed To Always Be Around  Very Attentive. Made You Feel As Though You Were The Only Guests In The Hotel. Also Rebecca In The Events Team  Excellent Communication And Ensured Our Evening Was Perfect.,,,,,
,1927,All Were Good,,,,,

,1932,The Hotel Manager Was Efficient Polite And Appeared Interested In His Guests Enjoying Their Stay  Nothing Appeared To Much Trouble.,,,,,
,1933,Alex  Who Served Our Drinks Was Excellent  But I Have To Say That There Were Far Too Many Staff  Who Did Not Have A Good Commend Of English. Whilst I Appreciate That These People Are Cheap  It Did Not Help Our Dining Experience.,,,,,
,1934,Unfortunately I Didn't Get Their Names  But The Young Barman On The Afternoon & Evening Of 20Th Nov And His Colleague The Next Night Were Both Very Attentive And Made Sure We Always Had A Drink. The Waiter Who Served The Cheese Board (Which Was Excellent) On The 20Th Was Very Accommodating And Advised Us Well.,,,,,
,1936,All Staff Apart From One Staff Member In The Bistro Were Very Attentive. Ashley Was Always Helpful And Always On Hand With Information.

,1937,From Arrival To Departure Your Were Fantastic !!!,,,,,
,1940,On This Occasion There Was No One Specific 'Stand Out' Person. Receptionist Was Good But I Did Not Get Her Name. Frederico As Always Was Attentive. I Thought The Pianist Was Better Than Last Time. Falconry Display Still Very Well Done.,,,,,
,1943,Frederico Aresti Was Very Kind And Helpful,,,,,
,1947,They Were All Speciall But The Receptionist Who Found A Post Code For Me And The Car Parking Luggage Porter Especially So,,,,,
,1948,Receptionist,,,,,
,1950,Lucy And Leah Always Do There Upmost To Make Our Stay Pleasant.,,,,,

,1961,The Reception Staff Were Very Attentive. Female Waitress In The Bistro Dealt With Our Complaint In A Very Professional Manner And Did Her Best To Rectify The Concerns We Raised.,,,,,
,1965,One Member Of Bar Staff Was Particularly Rude During The Course Of One Evening.,,,,,
,1974,A Couple Of The Younger Staff Were Hesitant And A Bit Unhelpful At Times  I Put This Down To Them Perhaps Being Unsure Of What They Were Allowed To Do.  Eg In The Oak Bar  The Tables Were All Marked As Reserved As There Was A Function.  When I Asked If We Could Eat There We Were Told Yes But We Couldn't Have A Table!   When I Pushed  Another Member Of Staff Pointed Out The Event The Tables Were Reserved For Was More Than An Hour Away So It Would Be Ok... A Minor But Unnecessarily Awkward Moment.  Empower The Staff To Make Decisions.,,,,,
,1976,Rita In The Spa As Previously Detailed.  All Of The Ladies On Reception And Matt Who Took Us For Our Archery Lesson.  He Was Extremely Pleasant  Patient And Accommodating.,,,,,
,1977,All Were Very Friendly,,,,,
,1981,Ashlie Was A Complete Star!,,,,,
,1982,Everybody Went Out Of Their Way To Make Us Feel At Home.,,,,,
,1984,Significant Difference Between Some Members And Others.  No-One Was Rude But Definitely Inattentive.  15 Mins To Order A Drink.  30 Mins To Order Afternoon Tea After Asking Three Times.  No Dockets For The Bar Were Ever Presented Or Signed Making It Difficult To Know At The End Of The Stay Whether We Had In Fact Received What We Were Charged For.,,,,,
,1986,All Were Excellent,,,,,
,1988,The Welsh Gentleman Serving Afternoon Tea Was Very Warm And Welcoming  Really Nice Guy. The Receptionists Could Be A Little Warmer In Service.,,,,,
,1990,Maintenance Tried Very Hard To Sort Radiator And Was A Very Pleasant Person Chatting Away To Us,,,,,
,1993,All Of The Staff,,,,,
,1995,They Waitress Who Helped Entertain Our Son On Monday Evening So We Could Enjoy Our Meal The More  But We Sadly Didn't Get Her Name.,,,,,
,1996,Corinna - Friendly  Funny And Helpful,,,,,
,1998,Sorry We Don't Know Her Name But The Pregnant Member Of The Staff In The Bistro Was Excellent  Very Helpful And Remembered Who We Were And What Our Room Number Was On The Second Day Making Us Feel We Were Valued Guests. Also (Again Apologies We Don't Know His Name) The Italian (We Think!) Manager Was Very Welcoming On Both Our Visits And Made Us Feel Special.,,,,,
,1999,All Staff Were Polite And Courteous At All Times Made Us Feel Special.,,,,,
,2000,The Dining Team Where Particularly Hospitable,,,,,
,2001,The Batman Refused To Serve As As We Were Deemed To Be With The Wedding  Therefore Could Not Be Served Drinks In The Main Bar,,,,,
,2004,The Porter Was Very Kind To Clean Up The Windshield Of Our Car After A Road Trip Without Even Asking Him For It,,,,,
,2007,Can't Recall Her Name  Sorry. Female Waitress  Eastern European With A Pony Tail. Possibly Called Catriona?? Made The Children Especially Feel Very Welcome. She Had Behaved Similarly On A Previous Visit Of Ours.,,,,,
,2008,To Be Fair  They Were All Very Good  Polite And Seamless In Their Professional Delivery.  It Would Be Difficult To Single Anyone Out In Particular As They Were All So Good.,,,,,
,2010,We Thought The Manager Was Superb!,,,,,
,2014,I Am Not Sure Of Names  But The Man Who Led The Clay Pigeon Shooting Was Great  And The Guy Who Ran The Cider Making Was A Real Character.  Thoroughly Enjoyed It.,,,,,
,2015,Let Down In Room Service With: Request For Warm Milk (For Child) On Saturday And Sunday Both Failing (Sunday's Didn't Ever Turn Up!)...This Caused Some Issue In Settling Our Child  Request For Menu To Be Sent To Room Not Being Met Long Delays On Room Service Dinner On Saturday....And Then Arriving With Wrong Order Failure To Replenish Toiletries,,,,,
,2016,Beca In The Bistro Remembered Us From Our Visit 5 Months Before As Soon As We Walked In To The Bistro Which Was Nice,,,,,
,2017,From Federico  And Throughout The Whole Team  We Were Made To Feel Welcome And Looked After With An Attentive  Courteous (But Not 'Over-Bearing') High Quality Of Service.,,,,,
,2018,All The Staff Were Excellent And Very Helpful. I Did Appreciate The Manager Himself Being So Visible And Approachable,,,,,
,2019,The Girl Who Ran The Bistro Was Very Professional  Pleasant  Polite And Courteous Under (At Times) Extreme Pressure - Again She Seemed The Running The Bistro Almost Single-Handedly - She Does Deserve Special Mention.  The General Hotel Manager Was Excellent - Everytime We Saw Him He Asked How We Were  If We Were Enjoying Our Stay And If There Was Anything He Could For Us - We Would Therefore Like To Complement Him - Again A Special Mention.  We Would Also Like To Mention How Much We Enjoyed The Birds Of Prey  Overall  The Staff At Bovey Castle Are Very Good - A Few Minor Hiccups Which Need To Be Rectified As Soon As Possible Before They Get Any Worse.  It Is Not Cheap To Stay At Bovey And When People Spend That Kind Of Money They Expect Things To Be Right - You Only Get One Chance To Make A First Impression!!!,,,,,
,2021,Jason Hopkins Nothing Was Too Much Bother For Him,,,,,
,2022,Heather Immediately Made Us Feel Welcome On Arrival .,,,,,
,2023,Ashley  Excelled At Her Role.,,,,,
,2027,General Manager Was Excellent - Kept A Close Eye On Everything And Sorted Anything That Needed Sorting. He Went The Extra Mile. Poor Experience Of Resort / Activities Desk Though - No One Answers The Phone Or Calls Back When You Leave A Message - That Is Disappointing For A Five Star Establishment.,,,,,
,2029,Everyone Was Lovely And Very Helpful,,,,,
,2035,All Were Wonderful,,,,,
,2037,All Were Excellent Which Makes It Hard To Single One Out. What An Delightful Problem To Have!,,,,,
,2040,Lorca (The Young Argentinian Waiter?) Was Very Helpful And His Sense Of Service Was Exemplary In The Dining Room,,,,,
,2041,Sam On Reception Went Out Of Her Way To Help Us  She Offered To Show Us Some Alternative Rooms With A View  But Unfortuanately This Was After The First Night Of Our Stay And We Did  Want To Pack Up All Our Things And Move Just For One Night. However  It Was Very Helpful  And Will Be An Advantage When We Book Next Time To Have This Information.,,,,,
,2046,Andrew In The Edwardian Grill  The Smiley Lady Sommelier,,,,,
,2048,The Concierge Was Very Good But I Didn't Get His Name  As Was The Maã®Tre D' Hotel In The Dining Room Who Was Under Great Pressure During Breakfast.,,,,,
,2049,Sam In The Bistro. Just Liked Him.,,,,,
,2050,All Bistro Staff Very Good.,,,,,
,2051,There Was One Young Gentleman  Ex Navy  Who Was Particularly Attentive And Helpful. We Met Him First In The Evening At The Dining Table When He Was Circulating To Make Us All Feel Welcome. He Also Helped Us In The Morning Re Suitable Dog Walking Routes And Just Generally Seemed To Go Out Of His Way To Make Us Feel Special. I'm Sorry  But His Name Now Escapes Us!,,,,,
,2053,Ben In The Restaurant,,,,,
,2055,Most Staff Were Excellent But At Breakfast The Service Was Very Poor. We Waited For A Table To Be Made Ready  We Werent Offered Coffee And Our Order Was Wrongly Delivered On 2 Occasions. This Refers Back To The Not Being Made To Feel Special Comment Earlier. We Stay In A Lot Of Lovely Hotels And Always Like To Feel That We Are Valued As Important Guests. Unfortunately This Wasnt The Case In The Restaurant For Breakfast Or Dinner.,,,,,
,2063,It Would Be Impossible To Pick One Member Of The Team From So Many Excellent Staff Members. I Did Appreciate Jade's Help During My Initial Booking Experience. Hotel Manager Very Friendly And Attentive.,,,,,
,2064,The Door Keepers,,,,,
,2068,My Wife Was Booked In As A Gluton Free Eater  These Notes Were Not Passed To The Kitchens And Carrot Cake Was Served And Was Not Glton Free....My Wife Was Poorly That Night...,,,,,
,2069,Alex Was Great With The Cocktail Making And Very Friendly Around The Place.  Becky (I Think) Was Also Very Friendly In The Castle Bistro.,,,,,

,2189,James Bond Was Charming And Funny Again As Was Adam. There Was One Member Of Staff Who I Did Think Was Rather Curt. I Did Not Get Her Name. After We Checked Out On The 9Th We Thought We Would Walk Around The Lovely Grounds Then Have Afternoon Tea Which We Also Did When We Arrived  We Sat Down In The Adams Room At A Table Which Was Not Laid For Afternoon And Asked The Waitress If We Could Have Afternoon Tea To Which She Quite Curtly Replied Have You Booked? Looking Around It Was Not Busy For Afternoon Tea So I Must Admit I Was Rather Surprised At Her Tone Of Voice. She Then Asked If We Were Staying At The Hotel To Which I Replied We Had Just Checked Out Today. She Then Wanted The Name And Room Number Which I Did Give Her. We Obviously Were Going To Pay Cash Not Add It To The Room Account As By Then It Had Been Closed. It Was A Shame She Had This Attitude Because It Gave Me A Feeling Of Not Being Very Welcome Which I Have Not Received At The Castle Before.,,,,,

,2229,Massive Issue With Handing Your Car Keys Over For Valet Parking And Keeping The Keys At Reception Neither Of Which We Were Happy With Which Almost Spoiled Our Stay As We Had Extremely Valuable Items In Vehicle.....This Issue Needs Sorting It Was Quite Intimidating The Pressure To Have To Hand Your Keys Over....Very Unhappy About This,,,,,
,2231,All Of Them! ....The Names I Remember: Frederico - You Are A Legend! Thanks You For Making Us Feel So Special. Katrina - A Mad Cap Lady - Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Her.

,2282,Couldn't Have Been Better,,,,,
,2284,Everyone Was Great. Very Kind And Helpful And Were Informal Without Being Over Friendly. A Great Asset.,,,,,

,2286,Adam Was Excellent In His Assistance With Activities And Walks  But In General We Were Made To Feel Very Comfortable Especially With Our Dalmatian In Tow. I Was Surprised That Housekeeping Did Rather Let The Side Down But That Is Easily Fixable Just More Attention To The Details.,,,,,
,2287,The Spa Service Was Wonderful.  Also  The Bar Server Was Quite Nice.  Bistro Service Was Unfriendly And Misinformed (They Told Me To Take A Taxi Service To A Nearby Town To Buy Bottled Water).  Luckily  I Discovered Later That Water Was Sold In The Golf Pro Shop.,,,,,

,2330,Frederico Is A Star!! Very Conscientious Seems Have The Ability To Know What Is Happening At All Times In The Hotel  Which Gives Him The Knowledge To Ensure His Guests Want For Anything.  Very Hands On Always Makes You Feel That Your At Home Away From Home. Other Key Players Are Rachel  Craig And The Very Helpful Barman Alex.,,,,,
,2331,Craig Was Particularly Helpful  He Retrieved My Son's Bag When He Left It Behind After Bovey Rangers And He Brought It Up To Our Room.,,,,,
,2334,The Castle Bistro Manager Did All They Could To Try And Recover Our Poor Dining Experience,,,,,
,2336,Verity Was Very Pleasant When She Showed Us Around The Hotel. One Member Of The Reception Team Seemed To Shout A Little When We Were Discussing What Was  And What Was Not  Included In Our Package. It Might Have Been Better If She Hadn't Broadcast Our Query To The Rest Of The Corridor.,,,,,
,2338,As We Arrived In A Less Than Expensive Car We Were Sneered At By Reception Staff.,,,,,
,2339,A Gentleman Called Matt In The Oak Bar Was Extremely Friendly And Helpful.  Very Courteous And Made Us Feel Very Welcome.  A Great Asset To Your Team.,,,,,
,2340,They Were All A Credit To The Business,,,,,
,2341,Julia Helped Us Arrange Our Activities  And She Did A Fabulous Job.  She Had A Good Sense Of Allowing Enough Time For Breaks In Between Activities So We Were Not Over-Scheduled.  She Also Gave Us Excellent Advice On What To Expect From Each Activity.  We Took A Driving Tour With David  And He Is A Wealth Of Knowledge About The Moor And Its History.

,2362,All Staff Very Hard Working And Attentive At All Times.,,,,,
,2364,I Don't Know His Name But He Worked In The Bistro - Small Black Guy Who Was Particularly Attentive And Lots Of Fun. Only One Individual Stopped Strongly Agree In All 3. We Were Fairly Abruptly Told That We Couldn't Order Afternoon Tea In The Lounge As Everywhere Was Reserved.  The Table We Were Sitting On Didn't Have A Reserved Sign.  It Would Have Been Nice For Hotel Guests To Have Somewhere To Go To Have An 'Un Planned' Afternoon Tea / Coffee,,,,,
,2365,When We Arrived We Were Met At The Door By A Young Woman  Sorry I Cannot Remember Her Name  She Helped With Our Luggage And Took Us To The Room And Seemed Geuinely Happy To Be There And Was Very Enthusiastic About The Hotel. When We Left A Young Man Came To Take Our Luggage  He Was Prompt  Efficient And Again Appeared Very Happy To Help. Sadly He Walked Away On Another Mission Before We Had A Proper Chance To Say Thank You To Him Properly.,,,,,
,2366,We Felt That Every Member Of Your Team Were Attentive And Helpful Which Clearly Reflects The High Standard Of Service You Strive To Provide Your Guests,,,,,
,2367,Reception Staff  When The Morning Walk On The 26Th Of Feb Was Cancelled (Although It Was On The Room Information And On The Board)  The Reception Staff Complained To The Back Office And Tried To Get One Arranged  My Wife Was Very Disapointed  It Was Cancelled As More People Wanted Archery (Although Only 2 People Signed Up For It).,,,,,
,2369,Frederiko Was Very Helpful And Understanding When We Explained Our Bistro Challenge  And Provided A Bottle Of Champagne As A Gesture And To Say Sorry. This Was A Nice Touch  Though We Would Have Preferred That The Meal Was Better And Not Received The Champagne. Frederiko's Style Was Very Warm And He Clearly Wanted To Make Our Stay Enjoyable.,,,,,
,2372,Restaurant Front Of House - As Stated,,,,,
,2373,Girl Who Showed Us To Our Room (Sorry Forgot Her Name)  Reception Staff  Door Staff And Manager. Bar Staff Seemed To Be More Alternative To Others Than Us - But May Have Been Timing,,,,,
,2376,The Young Staff Were Outstanding And Deserve The Highest Praise. Credit Must Also Go To Whoever Trained And Now Supervises Them.,,,,,
,2377,All The Staff Were Very Attentive.  However  There Was A Young Girl On Duty And At The Concierge Who Even Picked Up My Boots From My Car Who Couldnot Have Done Anything More To Make Our Stay Extra Special And Hassle Free.,,,,,
,2383,Craig Was Very Helpful In Sorting Out A Taster Menu For Us And Following Up To Make Sure Everything Was Alright.,,,,,

,2398,No One Member. We Found All Of The Team Supremely Curteous And Helpful.,,,,,
,2399,Breakfast Staff & Supervisors  Afternoon Waitresses  General Manager Were Really Nice,,,,,
,2400,Adam In Reception Looked After Us Very Well At All Times  But So Did So Many Other Staff,,,,,
,2401,The Enthusiastic Alex In The Bar (The Cocktails King!); George The Sommelier (A Good Man); All Your Young Men At The Main Entrance; All The Reception Staff; John(?) Who Gave My Wife And Me A Tour When We Arrived; The Tall Blonde Waitress In The Edwardian (Lovely Legs  Which Would Look Even Lovelier If She Wore Court Shoes!),,,,,
,2402,We Thought That Ben And Adam On The Events Desk Were Great  Good Sense Of Humour But Very Professional And Helpful. However All The Staff We Came In Contact With Were Very Courteous And Polite.,,,,,
,2404,All The Staff Were Excellent.,,,,,
,2409,Assistant Gm Was Very Customer Friendly And The Young Lady In The Bistro With Reddish Hair Was Very Bubbly And Helpful. Staff In The Oak Bar Were A Little Less Attentive And No 'Nibbles' We're Offered To Us On Night Two With Our Drinks Despite Being Provided To A Neighbouring Table. On Night One They Arrived Just As We Were Finishing Our Drinks Rather Like An After Thought - A Minor Detail  But Makes The Difference In Customer Satisfaction.,,,,,
,2411,Martin Was Exceptional. I Never Imagined I Would Find A Falconry Display Interesting But My Goodness I Did!!! My Husbands Idea   But We Were Both Enthralled. Martin Made It Enjoyable  Interesting  Informative And Left Me Thinking I Would Like  Know More His About His Birds. A Definite Recommendation For Our Friends And For Us To Watch Again On Our Next Visit,,,,,
,2412,Credit To All The Personnel We Met Who Without Exception Provided Both Efficient And Pleasant Service But Special Mention For Matt - He Was The First Member Of The Team We Met When We Arrived  Was On Duty For The Ferret Feeding And Hen Collecting  Helped With Various Ad-Hoc Queries And Was Unfailingly Welcoming  Helpful And Informative. Also Very Much Enjoyed Katie's Clay Pigeon Shooting Tuition Which Was Relaxed And Professional And It Was Evident That She Wanted To Ensure We Had A Good Experience.,,,,,
,2415,The Young Doorman Who Picked Us Up From The Lodge When It Was Raining Who Took Us To The Pub  Who Helped Us With Our Bags Into The Lodge When We Arrived. He Was Excellent,,,,,
,2417,I Would Like To Say I Found All Staff Helpful And Friendly Particularly In The Face Of Adversity  On The Morning Of The 11Th Sept There Was A Large Party Of Americans And It Appeared That Everybody Wanted Breakfast At The Same Time.  This Did Cause Some Delay And The Food Was Not The Best  Cold Even.  However  The Attitude Of Your Staff Were Impeccable And Saved The Day.  ,,,,,
,2418,The Staff Were Consistently Brilliant  You Should Be Delighted With All Of Them!,,,,,
,2419,The Lad On The Front Door Valet Parking The Car Was Outstanding In Difficult Conditions.  When It Became Obvious We Were Not Going To Be Able To Go Home And We Were Going To Have To Stay Over Your Desk Staff And Duty Manageress Could Not Have Been More Helpful. Our Luggage Was A Mess Having Been Travelling But Not Planning To Stay . We Had A Young Puppy In A Cage. Nothing Was To Much Trouble.,,,,,
,2420,All,,,,,
,2421,The Restrant Manager For His Excellent Attention To Detail And The Bar Staff.,,,,,
,2422,All The Staff That I Came Into Contact Were Most Helpful And Pleasant.,,,,,
,2430,All Staff Were Charming And Helpfull,,,,,
,2431,All Members Of Staff I Was Involved With Executed Their Duties Impecably,,,,,
,2432,We Thought That The Waitresses In The Bistro Were Good  Just The Right Amount Of Attention.,,,,,
,2434,We Did Not Catch Any Names But  An Older Gentleman With A 'Local' Sounding Accent On Reception  Who Despite Appearing To Be Just Going Off Duty  Went Out Of His Way To Go To The Kitchen To Obtain Tea  Milk And Hot Chocolate Supplies For Us At Around 10Pm On Thursday Evening And Bring Them To Our Room. Several Other Staff Were Noteworthy But Insufficient Room To Describe Them (In The Absence Of Names.)!,,,,,
,2435,Wonderful Staff  Liked The Fact That We Were Shown Around The Hotel On Arrival,,,,,
,2438,All Staff Very Good,,,,,
,2440,The Young Gentlman From Cardiff In The Valet Parking Team. Very Helpful  Knowledgable And Friendly.,,,,,
,2441,Sorry I Can't Remember The Names,,,,,
,2448,A Very  Lovely Girl Who Was On Duty When We Arrived Not  On The Reception Desk   As We Forgot To Print Our  Voucher ! Most Helpful,,,,,
,2449,Desk Staff All Very Helpful And Charming  In Particular Sarah  Ashley  Matt And Adam. Amy Was A Delight As She Showed Us The Ferrets And Chickens. The Waiter We Called 'Cheeseman' (Fairly Large Chap) Was Very Good And Gave Accurate And Enthusiastic Advice About Your Magnificent Cheeseboard. The Falconer Was Immensely Entertaining And A Lovely Surprise. Night Porter Good To Talk To  And Amusing About The Parrot.,,,,,
,2450,I Know This Sounds Corny But We Liked Everyone So It Would Be Hard To Pick One Person Out..,,,,,
,2454,Charlotte In The Main Dining Room As Well As The Bistro Was Very Helpful And Attentive. John Tobin Was Helpful In Taking Us To A Doctor's Office  And Driving Us To The Exeter Train Station. Don't Remember The Names  But Found The Golf Staff Very Helpful In Arranging A Golf Game For Me.,,,,,
,2455,All The Receptionists Were Very Helpfull,,,,,
,2458,The Baby Sitters Were Excellent,,,,,
,2460,The Two Ladies Serving Breakfast On Wednesday And Thursday Were Excellent.,,,,,
,2461,Ashley Who Was Extremely Helpful In Changing Our Room.,,,,,
,2462,Federico - Took The Time To Welcome Us And Had A Chat With After Dinner One Evening.  What A Lovely Chap He Is And A Real Asset To The Hotel.,,,,,
,2463,All The Staff Where Excellent And Friendly,,,,,
,2466,Good Overall But Let Down By Bar  Probably Language Not Up To Front Of House Requirment.,,,,,
,2468,We Should Have Made A Note Probably But Do Think Without Exception The Staff Were Wonderful.,,,,,
,2471,Frederico Was Very Helpful And Tried To Make Our Stay As Comfortable As Possible.,,,,,
,2475,Federico Was Brilliant  Really Making Sure We Were Looked After. All The Other Staff Were Wonderful Too And Were Lovely To Work With As A Team.,,,,,
,2476,Federico Aresti Hotel Manager Was Great Always Saw Him Talking To Guests - Ive Never Seen This At Any Hotel I Have Visited Before  Was Really Really Great.  The Gentleman Who Runs The Sloe Gina Nd Cider Class Was Also Amazing  Great Fun Really Engaged And Made Sure We All Enjoyed Our Time There. He Also Reccomened Cocktails In The Bar In Accordance To The Spirits / Flavours We Like.... They Where Spot On! I Also Met Lucy For A Show Around Of The Hotel - She Was Great And Took Time To Go Through Everything With Me.,,,,,
,2480,It Seemed To Be That Every Member Of Staff Who Was Not English Provided 100% Better Service Than Any Of The English Staff,,,,,
,2483,The Male Person Who Recommended The Cheese At Dinner!,,,,,
,2487,The Young Lady Concierge Was Terrific.,,,,,
,2489,All Staff Were Exceptional,,,,,
,2492,Both The Hotel Manager  Federico Aresti  And Rebecca Smith From The Events Team Were Fantastic And Put In Great Attention To Detail To Ensure Our Stay Was Fantastic.  Nothing We Asked For Was Too Much.,,,,,
,2497,Alex For His Wonderful Ability To Make Us Laugh And Entertain Us Whilst Making Sloe Gin And Cider.,,,,,
,2506,Matt Was Our Instructor For Archery And Air Rifle Shooting. He Was Very Professional And Talkitive. We Had A Very Pleasant Experience. We Found The Staff To Be Quite Young  And Were Pleasently Surprised Both With With Their Attention To Detail And Genuine Friendliness. Very Good Level Of Staff.,,,,,
,2508,As A General Comment  The Staff Were All Very Polite And Friendly. The Lady Who First Responded To Our Technical Tv Problems On The First Night  Whilst Polite  Did At Times Appear As Though She Would Rather Not Be There And Suggested The Problem Had Been Fixed On Several Occasions When This Was Clearly Not The Case. With Experience As A General Manager Myself  I Recognised Her Attitude As One Of A Member Of Staff Attempting To Escape A Difficult Situation!!!,,,,,
,2510,Debbie In The Spa. She Is Exceptional And A Real Asset. Bovey Should Look After Her Well. She Is What Made My Stay Really Welcoming And Special.,,,,,
,2512,The Manager Was Extremely Helpful,,,,,
,2514,The Doormen And Reception Staff Were Great As Was Craig And Martin Who Assisted Us With The Activities.,,,,,
,2518,Again  The Porters Were First Class. I've Already Mentioned Reception Experience. Another Example Was In The Lounge One Morning We Wanted A Cup Of Coffee. We Had To Go And Find The Guy (Short  Larger Guy About 35-40) Who Was Chatting Hidden In A Corner With Other Staff. Then When We Requested The Bill Rather Than Bring Us The Bill He Made Us Go Through 3 Rooms Into The Bar To Pay The Bill. No Problem  But He Was A Little Rude.,,,,,
,2519,Craig Was Particularly Helpful And Friendly And Really Made Us Feel At Home. There Was Also A French Girl (I Don't Remember Her Name But I Know She Is Doing An Internship And Is Based In Paris) Who Was Very Helpful And Friendly. She Always Had A Smile On Her Face. There Was One Lady At The Bar (I Don't Remember Her Name) But She Was Not Very Friendly And Seemed To Sulk Quite A Bit So I Have Rated This Part As Agree Rather Than Strongly Agree.,,,,,
,2520,I Think Her Name Was Felicity  She Showed Us To Our Room On Arrival  Very Nice And Friendly,,,,,
,2521,Please Note The Service For Most Of Our Stay Was Great - With The Exception Of The Afternoon Tea  Where I Had To Get Up Twice To Ask For Items I Required - I Would Expect The Staff To Have Volunteered These,,,,,
,2522,Federico Aresti.  Kind & Caring  Excellent Hotel Manager.,,,,,
,2524,Craig  Ashlie & Polly - They Helped Make The Teams Stay Easy  Effortless And Very Comfortable.  They Are Real Assets To Your Team And Hopefully Our Thanks From Gilead Can Be Passed Onto Them.  Nothing Is Too Much Of A Problem And Someone Was Always On Hand To Make Sure We Were Comfortable With How The Agenda Was Working And They Dealt With Changes At The Last Minute Without Fuss And Made My Job Coordinating The Meeting So Much Easier.,,,,,
,2526,All The Staff Were Very Helpful And Friendly.,,,,,
,2528,The Lady In The Spa - Kim - Was Very Helpful And Friendly.,,,,,
,2530,Staff Outside Meal Times Were Great.  Staff In The Restaurants Seem To Try And Avoid Catching Your Eye And Were Not Very Useful When You Did.  Even Tea Was Slow - After 20 Minutes And Having Asked Twice For Someone To Come Over  I Had To Go Over To Them And Order As My Friend Is 6 Months Pregnant And Was Starving!,,,,,
,2531,We Rang And Asked For Our Luggage To Brought Down At Check Out And Put In Our Car While We Went For A Walk  We Came Back Over An Hour Later And My Husband Had To Go Up And Get Our Bags With A Girl As It Had Not Been Done...Simple Stuff. I Did Not Feel That You Warranted The 12.5% Service Charge You Put On Everything As The Service And Food Really Let Our Stay Down. The Best Part Was When A Waiter Smashed Bowl Of Chips On Our Table And Left Shards Of The Dish On The Table While We Were Eating!! Then They Came To Wipe Our Table Which Had A Sticky Mess On It With A Dry Cotton Napkin - Not A Cloth Or Surface Spray.. Needless To Say The Mark Didn't Come Out. I Think Your Staff Need More Training And To Be Shown How It Can Be Done By Some Real Professionals.,,,,,
,2535,There Was A Young Lady (Abbey I Think) She Was One Of The First People We Meet After Federico. She Gave Us A Tour Of The Castle. Telling Us Facts And Stories And Them Showing Us To Our Room. She Also Organised Our Activities And Also Suggested A Fee As Well. Her Knowledge Of The Castle Was Amazing And Especially After We Found Out It She Was Brand New To The Castle. She Made My Partner And Me Feel Very Welcome And At Times When We Got Lost Lol,,,,,
,2540,The Spa Staff Were The Best Part Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,2542,The French Bar Manager And Bar Staff In General  Who Went Out Of Their Way To Look After Us  The Reception Staff  Ben Who Showed Us How To Make Cider  Craig Who Picked Us Up From The Station  The Manager On Reception Who Pointed Us In The Right Direction For Our Walk.,,,,,
,2543,On Our Arrival  We Were Greeted By John. He Really Went Out Of His Way To Meet Our Needs. Throughout Our Entire Stay  He Would Check Up On Us  Ask Us If We Needed Anything  Made Sure To Make Reservations For Us Or Even Suggest Things Which We Might Like. He Was Friendly And Charming And We Wanted To Thank Him For Making Our Weekend Getaway Even Better! Thank You John!,,,,,
,2544,Thought All The Staff Were Excellent And A Credit To The Hotel,,,,,
,2547,Very Impressed With The Effort Virtually All The Staff Went To To Remember Who We Were During The Course Of Our Stay  Made Us Feel Extra Welcome And At Ease,,,,,
,2549,Service From Bar Staff At The Wedding Was Poor - No Smiles  Slow Service  Poor Quality Product I.E. Lime Cordial Used Rather Than Fresh Lemons And Limes. Extra Drinks Added To Our Tab That We Didnt Have  Long Wait Times With No Acknowledgment...Generally Grumpy Service,,,,,
,2550,I Don't Know Who Was Responsible  But After Checkout I Discovered That I'd Left My Jewelery In The Safe. It Was Overnighted To Me At Our Next Hotel  Along With Cookies And Fudge! Way Beyond Expectations! I Am Extremely Greatful!,,,,,
,2551,The Manager  Frederico And Ashley The Wedding Coordinator Who Both Were Exceptional. The Falconer Who Was As Entertaining As Ever,,,,,
,2553,The Manager Of The Edwardian Grill Who Was Attentive And Informative And Looked After Us Really Well.,,,,,
,2557,All Staff Were Very Polite And Made Us Feel At Home,,,,,
,2568,The Manager  Who Appeared To Be The Only One Who Actually Noticed If Any Of Us Were Wanting Something.,,,,,
,2569,Samuel Was Very Warm And Friendly Made Us Feel At Home Very Good At His Job,,,,,
,2570,See My Comments On The Edwardian Grill - Just A Little Lacking In Organisation And Control,,,,,
,2572,No All Excellent.,,,,,
,2575,No But Receptionist Was Slightly Arrogant & Abrupt,,,,,
,2576,General Manager  Ensured That My Disability With My Leg Did Not Get In The Way   Running Me To The Lodge Several Times. Thanks,,,,,
,2579,Ben - Who Took Us Around When We Arrived - Always Spoke When We Met And Is A Credit To Your Establishment,,,,,
,2581,Can't Find Any Name  But They Were All Very Professional,,,,,
,2583,Rebecca In Reception Very Helpful Before  During And After The Stay,,,,,
,2584,The Reception Team And Rachel And The Dining Room Manager And Staff,,,,,
,2585,The Manager Was Exceptional And Involved Himself In Every Aspect Of Our Stay Could Not Have Been More Attentive If He Tried!,,,,,
,2590,The Bar Staff And Waiters In The Edwardian Grill Were Particularly Helpful And Friendly.,,,,,
,2591,The Hungarian Bartender In Oak Bar Was Especially Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,2594,The Young Waitress At Breakfast In The Edwardian Grill Was Attentive  Friendly And Charming. The Young Man And Woman Who Were 'Outdoor' Staff Were Excellent Ambassadors And Made Us Feel As If We Were To Have A Special Experience. It Was Not Their Fault That We Dido Not.,,,,,
,2597,They Were All Very Helpful But The Reception Staff Did Assist With Local Road Knowledge On More Than One Occasion,,,,,
,2601,Katrina  Your Sommelier  Was Extremely Knowledgeable In Her 'Wine Tasting Demonstration'   Has A Very Warm Personality.  We Asked If We Could Be Taken Around The Grounds As My Hushand's Scooter Would Not Have Been Able To Get Up Some Inclines. John Took Us On A Tour By Golf Buggy And Was Extremely Courteous And Helpful,,,,,
,2603,All Good.,,,,,
,2609,Rachel Was Very Attentive And Helpful,,,,,
,2611,Norman  The Driver Of The Motor Tour  Very Kind And Very Knowledgeable About The Moor And The Animals - A He Is A Farmer In His Main Job  - And Of Course The Manager With His Italien Generosity,,,,,
,2612,A Couple Of Waiters Did Not Understand Or Speak English Well Enough To Understand Or Respond To Our Needs  As Mentioned Above.,,,,,
,2614,All Staff Were Very Polite And Helpful,,,,,
,2616,John  Always Very Polite And Willing To Help.Good Hotel Knowledge,,,,,
,2621,Head Waiter In Dining Room Very Pleasant ,,,,,
,2623,No,,,,,
,2626,Julie! Fantatico,,,,,
,2627,The Young Man Who Helped With Our Luggage On Arrival.   He Was Polite And Helpful And Must Have Been Totally Exhausted When He Had Finished Unloading Our Cars.,,,,,
,2636,I Wish They Would Stop Saying ' Is There Anything Else I Can Do For You?'   They Were Sometimes Trying To Hard To Be Comfortable.,,,,,
,2637,Alec  Who Ably Managed All Our Luggage From Room 34 To The Car In One Trip !!,,,,,
,2641,Golf Team Were Unbelievable. Helpful  Informative And Determined To Ensure We Had A Good Round,,,,,

,2653,All Were Equally Helpful And Polite,,,,,
,2658,Our Wine Waiter Was Excellent - Very Attentive And Professional,,,,,
,2659,As Mentioned Previously - Ben Your Maitre D'hotel.,,,,,
,2662,Not Really  Mr Arestie Was Very Attentive And Very Professional  Probably Because Of My Previous Complaint.,,,,,
,2663,As Prev. Mentioned Doona Felicity  Then Of Course We Meet The Manager ! Frederick A Star   He Made My Wife's Stay Memorable  He Was Low Profile Yet Seemed To Be Covering All Our Needs With Discretion  And Thoughtfulness   Heis The Perfect Man To Carry This 5 Star Property To It's Well Deserved Position In The Domestic Luxury Hotels And Lodges League You Are Definitely Number One !,,,,,
,2667,Your Team Member Who Served Us Tea In One Of The Lounges Was Very Nice And Helpful,,,,,
,2668,A Young Gentleman In The Bistro  He Lives Nearby Goes To University In London And Is Studying Music. He Works At Bovey Castle During His Breaks From University.    He Brought Our Coffee Into The Lounge  Where He Talked To Us For Sometime  Telling Us About University And About Working At Bovey  Very Intellegent And A Joy To Talk To.,,,,,
,2669,Everyone Is Lovely,,,,,
,2673,Head Waiter In Edwardian For Evening Meal Was Excellent,,,,,
,2676,Everyone Was Off The Scale In All Three Of The Above Categories. No One Member Of Staff Stood Out For Us  They Were All Excellent.,,,,,
,2678,All Of Them And Especially You,,,,,
,2680,The Chambermaid For Room 28 Was Very Good.,,,,,
,2682,All Were Considerate And Efficient,,,,,

,2695,They Were All Hugh Class Staff Who Were Excellent. No Fault Here Whatsoever,,,,,
,2699,Chris Was Particularly Helpful Looking After Us When We Had Finished Our Evening Meal.,,,,,
,2701,Reception. Very Friendly And Professional.  Slovakian Waiter.,,,,,
,2703,One Waiter In The Main Restaurant And One Waiter In The Bistro Let Your Whole Team Down. Everybody Else Were Great,,,,,
,2705,Frederico For Always Having A Smile And For Always Being Present To Assist The Guests. Polly For Entertaining The Children. Vicky At Reception For Her Helpfulness And The Lovely Lady In The Playbarn. The Young Lady In The Bar For Her Fab Cocktails And The Manager In The Bistro For Her Warmth And Efficiency.,,,,,
,2707,Federico And Rachel (?) Who Is Pregnant At The Moment  Are Both Wonderful And Make Us Feel Very Much At Home  Aswell As Certain Staff In The Bar!,,,,,
,2711,They Were All Great  My Dog George Appreciated Their Attention As Well,,,,,
,2714,The Spa Team (Particular The Lady You Administered My Treatment) Were Excellent.,,,,,
,2716,The Manager Fredrico Was Very Friendly And Helpful  Made Everything Work Perfectly,,,,,
,2718,Frederico Was Very Hands On And Quickly Dealt With Any Issues That Needed Attention  We Had Complete Confidence In His Ability To Make Our Stay Achieve Our Expectations. Emma Who Looked After Our Private Dining Experience Extremely Well And Knew Exactly How To Respond To Our Wishes And Made A Big Contribution To The Success Of Our Stay,,,,,
,2727,Front Desk People Were Polite And Responsive.  Bellman Were Rude (Especially In Their Efforts To Keep Us Out Of The Main Hotel Due To The Wedding).  Dining Staff Were Average.,,,,,
,2730,Everybody We Came Into Contact With Was Friendly And Professional,,,,,
,2737,Our Thanks Go To The Hotel Manager  Federico Anesti  Who Was Very Helpful And Quickly Sorted The Room Problem.,,,,,
,2738,Our Waitress In The Dining Room Was Very Professional. We Have No Name  She Was Young And  We Believe  French.,,,,,
,2747,Federico Is Doing An Exceptional Job  He Leads His Staff By Example  He Is Always Visible In The Hotel  Chatting With Guests  And Monitoring The Staff  Dining Rooms Etc.(Something You Can't Do From An Office Desk!) After Chatting To Lots Of The Staff He Clearly Has Their Respect  And His Profesisonal 'Nothing Is Too Much Trouble Attitude' Rubs Of On Them. Also Verity A Lovely  Genuine Girl With A Great Attitude  She Showed Us The Lodges And Other Rooms  Was Very Professional  And Helpful. I't's A Shame She Is Leaving As I Think She Will Go Far In This Business.,,,,,
,2753,Wonderful Attentive Staff,,,,,
,2755,Everyone Was Very Polite And Professional,,,,,
,2758,Ended Up With Two Breakfasts Due To The 'Limited' English Language Ability Of The Waitress - But Who Was Otherwise Fine,,,,,
,2761,Reception Staff Were Great.  Bar Staff Were Good  But No Cocktail Sticks  No Bombay Saphire No Hendrix.  I'm Not Sure Sure The Breakfast Staff Were There At All  Apart From In Body  And Of Course They Can Smile And Nod Politely.  But In Terms Of Actually Serving Breakfast ?,,,,,
,2762,It Was Disappointing To Be Told That We Should Have Booked When We Asked For A Cup Of Tea And Piece Of Cake On Sunday Afternoon  As We Were Guests At The Hotel.,,,,,
,2766,The Boys Who Took The Chicken/Ferret Visit Were Very Good With Our Enthusiastic 3 Yr Old,,,,,
,2768,The Waiter Who Worked During The Day/Lunch/Afternoon Was Fantastic And I Did Have A Chat With Him After Checking Out Telling Him Of My Disappointment With The Service In The Evenings. He Listened To My Experience And Apologised And Said He Would Have A Word With The Evening Staff.  Although He Did Bring An Ashtray To Our Table On Our Arrival After Gorgeous Afternoon Tea  Which Was Not Clean!  However He Was Great And Has All That It Takes To Work To The Expectation Guests Require In Such A Hotel.  The Evening Bar And Restaurant Staff Were Appalling In Both Areas Ie Restaurant And Bistro - It Would Be Better If You Had Take Out Menus For Both Food And Drinks For Your Guests Or Self-Service.  Also Breakfast Staff Seemed Half Asleep And Not On The Ball.,,,,,
,2772,No They Were All Nice,,,,,
,2774,Everyone I Came Into Contact With Was Extremely Helpful And Pleasant,,,,,
,2776,Verity Was Outstanding In Her Help On Our Arrival And Departure Particularly In Helping Elderly Grandparents And Making Them Feel Totally At Ease Which Was No Easy Task.,,,,,
,2777,The Staff On Reception Were Attentive And Helpful But Other Staff On The Terrace And Bistro Seemed To Busy Or Otherwise Occupied To Deal With Us.,,,,,
,2778,Lucy Was Amazing,,,,,
,2779,No  But No Need For Staff To Keep Asking If Everything Ok,,,,,
,2783,All Staff Members Went Out Of Their Way To Make It Such A Fab Experience,,,,,
,2791,Hannah Looked After Us Very Well For Our Pre-Dinner Drinks,,,,,
,2794,Overall Experience Consistently Excellent.,,,,,
,2795,Again Same Note As Before This Is Hard For Me...  When It Comes To The People Helping With Resort Activities And Federico  I Have To Say Far Exceeded Expectations.  Beyond Happy!  However It Is A Mixed Bag And Other Staff Less Than Helpful And Friendly.  Another Example Was When We Visited The Golf Pro Shop  'No You Can Not Have A Golf Cart Tour Of The Course' 'No You Cant Walk On The Golf Course' 'No You Cant Play Course Is To Wet' 30 Minutes Later We See Two People Teeing Off!  Very Strange...  Same Thing In Restaurant 'Can We Request Another Table' No  Etc...  Unfortunate Because Half Seem To Be Over The Top Professional And The Other Half Not So Much...,,,,,
,2796,Welsh Man Who Greeted Us On Arrival And The Sommelier In The Edwardian Restaurant,,,,,
,2806,Mixed On The Attentive Based Mainly On The Resteraunt Expeirience,,,,,
,2812,The Manager Federico  Made Us Feel Particularly Welcome. Preferred Drink Not Available At Bar He Offered A Very Satisfactory Alternative With The Meal. He Followed Up With A Progress Report And Even Though The Drink Was Not Available For The Entire Stay  I Felt He Was Genuinely Concerned That Our Needs Not Met.,,,,,
,2813,Uniformly Excellent,,,,,
,2817,All The Girls On Reception Were Well Trained And Friendly.,,,,,
,2819,Katrina The Sommelier Who Is Extremely Knowledgeable And Has A Very Warm Personality And John Who Drove Us In A Buggy To Show Us The Surroundings As My Husband Was Unable To Use His Light Scooter Due To Some Of The Steep Hills.,,,,,
,2820,Not In A Positive Way,,,,,
,2827,Sarah On Reception Worked With Me To Make It A Special  Eekend For Us (We Got Engaged During Our Stay) And Was Very Helpful. I Am Afraid I Do Not Know The Name Of The Bar Manager In The Oak Bar (Tall  Silvering Hair) But He Was Very Helpful And Friendly . A Total Gentleman .,,,,,
,2828,Basing Comments On Our Dining Experience,,,,,
,2829,They Were All Excellent.,,,,,
,2830,The Person Who Looked After Our Needs During Our Meeting In The Library Was Excellent And I Would Say That The Rest Of The Team Were Better Than Average.,,,,,
,2834,Sammy (Reception) Was Extremely Helpful And Polite.,,,,,
,2835,Yes The Young Welsh Man Who Took My Family Party For The Archery Event And Also Was Extremely Polite And Helpful Each Time We Met Him Through Our Stay.  Unfortunately I Cannot Remember His Name.,,,,,
,2841,No,,,,,
,2842,Thought The Falconer Could Have Been More Polite !,,,,,
,2843,The Young Ladies Working In The Bar During My Stay Were Delightful  Efficient And Caring.  I Had Afternoon Tea  Hadn't Made A Booking  But A Table Was Found For Me.  I Also Made Two Ventures To The Bar And  Apart From An Extremely Noisy Fridge  Which Needed Repair  It Was Peaceful And Relaxing.,,,,,
,2847,A New Waitress Was On Her First Night In The Bistro She Was Really Excellent.,,,,,
,2860,Reception Staff,,,,,
,2865,The Restaurant Manager   Awaful With Customer Services,,,,,
,2866,Receptionists And Front Of House Staff,,,,,
,2871,See Q8 Ealier,,,,,
,2880,Thank You To The Staff That Assisted In Setting Up The Summer House For The Proposal  Including Ensuring The Candles Were Lit And Coming Over To Take Photos For Us.,,,,,
,2882,The Manager Fredrico. Dealt With A Minor Complaint In A Professional Manor.,,,,,
,2885,All Of The Team They Were Very Polite And Attentive,,,,,
,2889,Chrystina The Sommelier Was Passionate About Her Job But All Staff Deserve Praise.,,,,,
,2916,All Members Of Staff Were Friendly And Professional,,,,,
,2974,We Had Guests For Dinner One Night  And Asked For The Menus To Be Printed Without Prices. This Was Done Without Further Requests  And Made The Evening Special. Thank You.,,,,,
,3041,Young Man On The Door Sunday Night Was Very Helpful,,,,,
,3065,The Young Man On The Front Doorstep....Although He Was Freezing  He Was Polite And Jovial Each Time We Saw Him. Also Ben  From The Entertainments Team  Was Both Friendly  Courteous And Very Helpful.,,,,,
,3105,Alex In The Bar Is Very Sweet  And Bistro Chef Is Great.,,,,,
,3107,The Gardeners Simon  Ian And Paddy Who Were Happy To Spend Time Talking With My Children And Explaining What They Were Doing And Indeed Putting Them To Work Weeding!,,,,,
,3115,Staff Were Fantastic  Especially Ashley.  Reception Needs A Reorganisation.  I Received My Christmas Pack With Numerous Errors  Typos Etc  My Mother Asked For Hers To Be Sent To Her And It Wasn't Sent.  I Organised My Christmas Actvities And Still Received About 5 Phone Calls From Reception Asking Me To Book My Activities.  Apart From That The Staff Are Extremely Friendly And Accomodating.,,,,,
,3325,Our Driver To The Quad Bikes Was Charming And Told Us Alot About The Area.  I Believe His Name Was Rob  A Longtime Employee Of Bovey.  He Was A Highlight Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,3707,Resort Manager  Craig - Attentive Throughout Our Stay And Could Not Have Been More Accommodating.  The Reception Team Were Always Very Friendly And Helpful. Staff In The Oak Bar Were Very Helpful And Knowledgable.,,,,,
,3709,Fantastic  Relaxed But Attentive Staff Team With No Pretentiousness But Loads Of Respect  If That Makes Sense. All Those Who Looked After Us Were Great; Even The Lodge Cleaning Crew Made My Eldest Daughter Smile When They Turned Up And Flew Around The Place In Record Time,,,,,
,3711,Matt Showed Us Archery And Looked After Us. Also Greeted By Tall Blonde Young Lady  Cannot Remember Her Name  Gave Us The Tour When We Arrived. She Was Very Professional And Acknowledged Us Regularly.  In General I Was Impressed By The Overall Standards Of All Of The Staff,,,,,
,3714,The Room Service And The Team In Edwardian Grill Was Excellent.  The Receptionists Were Not That Good.,,,,,
,3716,The Manager In The Grill Was Great. However Her Staff Were Very Poor. Most Of Their Uniforms Seemed Ripped On The Waistcoats. The Porter Who Broke The Handle Of Our Suitcase (A Vintage Leather And Brass Suitcase): And Then Did Not Tell Anyone Was Obviously Very Poor. This Got Our Stay Off To A Really Poor Start. Why Would You Break The Handle Then Tuck It Back - As If We Wouldnt Notice It Was Broken? However The Manager Joanna Who Came To Resolve The Matter Was Great. The Staff Who Said The Room Was Quiet Were Either Hugely Inexperience Or Lying. The Porter Who Move Us At 10Pm Was Nice. The Staff In The Evening Meal Where Nice - But Not Very Good - Breaking The Cork And Having The Wrong Menus. The Bird Display In The Morning Was Wonderful. The Check-Out Girl Asked How Our Stay Was And When I Said Well Actually Half And Half  She Just Went 'Oh Ok'. Which I Think Just Summed It Up. Why Ask If You Dont Care.,,,,,
,3717,See Comments Above Re Staff. Service Levels Need Addressing And So Does The Fact Some Staff Do Not Understand Basic English. Very Underwhelming  Disappointing Experience.,,,,,
,3726,Girl Managing The Bar Next To The Edwardian Grill Was Friendly  As Was The Lady In The Bistro.,,,,,
,3728,John  Who Showed Us Round When We First Arrived And A Tall Blonde Female Waitress/Manager Who Worked In The Bistro. Unfortunately I Didn't Get Her Name But She Was Exceedingly Helpful And Professional And Prevented Our Dinner Experience In The Bistro Becoming A Slightly Negative Experience.,,,,,
,3731,Sam In The Bar Was Great. Felicity Gave Us A Great Welcome. Young Dark Haired Waitress In Bar Was Attentive & Lovely While In The Lounges,,,,,
,3742,The Staff Were Excellent.,,,,,
,3743,The Waiter Who Served Us At Dinner Was Very Apologetic About The Food.  It Was Disappointing To Be Told On Sunday Afternoon That We Should Have Booked When We Asked If We Could Get A Cup Of Tea And Some Cake Or Scones. We Were Guests At The Hotel And You Expect To Be Able To Get A Cup Of Tea At Any Time Without Having To Pre-Book!,,,,,
,3745,Carina And Fed As They Both Helped Me With My Engagement To Lizz,,,,,
,3749,The Reception Staff Were Prompt And Helpful. Every Other Staff Member We Passed Said Hello Which Was Lovely,,,,,
,3753,All The Staff Were A Absolute Delight  Extremely Thoughtful And Polite. We Very Much Appreciated The Champagne In Our Lodge From The Manager  Thank You.,,,,,
,3761,Federico And Martin The Falconer Were Incredible.,,,,,
,3762,All Of The Staff That Put Up With Us During Breakfast Were Excellent - As Americans We Had Many Demanding Requests And Everyone Was Very Gracious.,,,,,
,3764,Although We Didn't Have Her Name  The Dark Haired Waitress Working In The Bistro On Mon 5Th & Tues 6Th Nov Was Friendly And Very Attentive.,,,,,
,3766,Ben Who Ran The Crolf And Archery Activities Was Excellent And Even Looked After The Meeting Room So Valuables Could Be Left While People Went To Watch The Falconry Display,,,,,
,3769,All Members Of Staff Were Superb And A Credit To You,,,,,
,3770,Not This Time,,,,,
,3773,A Member Of The Bar Staff- I Don't Have His Name But Working Thursday 22Nd Early Evening,,,,,
,3776,The Member Of Staff That Welcomed Us From Our Car  Took Our Luggage  And Saw Us To Our Room (Arrival Sunday 24Th Feb 3Pm  I Think His Name Was Alex) Was Excellent And Set A Very High Standard.,,,,,
,3781,The Husband And Wife Team Who Ran The Oak Room And Dinner Service At The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,3784,I Don't Remember His Name But The Falconry Expert Was Quite Funny! Very Fun Attitude And Manner.,,,,,
,3785,The Concierge (Adam?) Was Very Helpful.,,,,,
,3787,Building On Previous Feedback  The Italian Guy Was Brilliant At All Times. However  After Our Expereince In The Bistrot On Our First Night  Described On Previous Page  We Went To Reception To Ask What Time Breakfast The Next Day Finished. The Receptionist Said It Might Be 10 Or 11 She Didn't Really Know. She Did Not Offer To Find Out For Us But Just Laughed About Her Not Being Much Use.   The Next Day  We Asked About Hiring Bikes And Were Asked To Sit At Luke's Desk (At Least I Think He Was Called Luke). We Duly Did And Were Waiting For 15 Minutes Before I Went To Recpetion To Ask Where Luke Was  One Of Them Rang Him And We Were Told He Was 15 Minutes Away!! But Then And Only Then  Courtesy Of The Italian Guy Getting Involved  They Worked Out We Didn't Actually Need Luke To Hire The Bokes Anyway. A Total Waste Of 20 Minutes.,,,,,
,3788,Federico Was Especially Attentive And Always Nice To Talk To. Excellent Manager!,,,,,
,3789,The Manager Was Excellent. The Staff In The Bar Were Also Very Good.,,,,,
,3792,I Think He Was Called Alex And Was The Person Who Did The Archery And Rifle Shooting With Us - He Was Great And Made Us Feel Very Comfortable And We Had Great Fun.,,,,,
,3794,The Check In Staff Were Very Polite Which Impressed Us.  The Only Problem Was The Heat In The Room And Our Complaint Then Not Being Dealt With In A Satisfactory Way.  We Are So Sad It Turned Out Like That Because It Was Such A Lovely Venue And After Recent Health Problems We Had Really Been Looking Forward To The Visit.,,,,,
,3797,The Bartender Was Particularily Inviting.,,,,,
,3802,Leah Was Brilliant Though Out The Whole Wedding  She Couldn't Have Been More Helpful.,,,,,
,3807,I Regret That I Can't Recall His Name  But The Porter Who Brought My Bags Up And Took Them Back Down Was Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,3808,Sammy/Sami On Reception Was Extremely Polite & Friendly On Departure.. She Also Had An Excellent Phone Manner!!,,,,,
,3817,The Activities Host Was Brilliant And Arranged All Of Our Activities Efficiently And With Great Enthusiasm. Can Not Praise Him Enough. However The Cleaning Staff Were Not Up To Our Expectations.,,,,,
,3821,We Were Shown Around The Hotel By A Young Female Member Of Staff With Dark Brown Hair And She Was Fabulous But I Can't Remember Her Name,,,,,
,3822,Thanks Federico - Great As Always.,,,,,
,3826,This Is Where Bovey Is Let Down. Most Staff Were Fantastic  It Was A Pleasure. But Some Others Were So Disinterested  Rude  Not Interested In What We Were Asking For At All. Particularly At Breakfast. If The Breakfast I Ordered Can't Come With The Muffin As The Menu Said Then Just Tell Me That  Instead Of Pretending A Squashed Slice Of Toast Is A Muffin  Grunting  Whisking My Breakfast Away  Then Returning With Again Toast.,,,,,
,3829,All The Reception Staff And The Boys In Tweed,,,,,
,3831,The Door Men Were Very Attentive And Helpful. The Man Who Conducted The Falconry Displays Was Excellent And Is A Brilliant Addition To Breakfast.,,,,,
,3842,All Of Them Were Excellent,,,,,
,3851,Federico Aresti - Went Out Of His Way To Make Us Feel Welcome  At Home And Continually Checked That We Were Happy.,,,,,
,3852,Valet Chap At The Door. Tall Chap But Cannot Remember His Name I'm Afraid.,,,,,
,3853,The Manager!,,,,,
,3854,In General  A Very Nice Set Of Staff  And Generated A Very Homely Environment,,,,,
,3855,Alex Was Very Helpful  As Was Jason.  Most Staff Were Great Though.,,,,,
,3856,We Wanted To 'Strongly Agree' For All Of The Above But Felt Some Of The Staff During Breakfast Weren't Quite As Warm And Friendly As The Totally Wonderful Other Members Of Your Team Who Consistently Made Us Feel Welcome And Very Much At Home Throughout Our Stay,,,,,
,3860,The Lady Who Welcomed Us  Appreciated My Wife Was A Touch Travel Sick And Provided Some Water. The Gentlemen Who Served Us Dessert Gave Very Good Recommendations On The Cheese Board And Was Also Very Attentive During Breakfast Service. The Entire Team In The Bistro Were Very Welcoming And Attentive  And The Gentlemen That Hosted The Falconry Display Deserves A Mention For Keeping Everyone Entertained On A Daily Basis.,,,,,
,3861,Federico Assisted With Issues Promptly While Busy With Other Needs. Arpad(Spelling) Was Excellent,,,,,
,3863,Sue (?) Blond Hair Lady Who Met Us And Took Us To Our Room's On Arrival And All The Chamber Staff. All The Staff Were Exceptional.,,,,,
,3865,All The Staff Were Excellent As Always. I Unfortunately Cannot Remember The Name Of The Member Of Staff  She Was Working In The Piano Bar During Our Stay Late Afternoon / Evening (14 - 16 Feb 2013). I Did Mention To One Of The Supervisors How Impressed I Was With Her Attention To Detail In Making The Drinks And Quality Of Service. All The Staff However Make You Feel So Welcome  They Are Interested In Your Day And Remember What Activities We Were Doing  And Make A Point Of Finding You To Specifically Ask. It's Things Like That  Which Make Me Come Back To Bovey,,,,,
,3867,The Manager Was Attentive And Attempted To Resolve Issues Promptly. The Waiter Serving Our Wine And Food At The Edwardian Grill Was Charming And The Level Of Service We Experienced Here Was Faultless.,,,,,
,3868,Alex (Activities) And A Lovely Blonde Waitress In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,3871,The Cocktail Guy  And The Guy That Gave Us A Lift In From Moretonhampstead,,,,,
,3873,Julia Gave A Fantastic Introduction To The Castle  Was Very Professional And Gave A Fantastic First Impression.,,,,,
,3877,I Regret Not Taking A Name But One Of The Girls Who Took Our Luggage To Our Room Was Very Courteous And Always Friendly And Welcoming.  Very Understanding Of Our Needs.,,,,,
,3878,Please See Comments About Waiting And Bar Staff In Previous Section About Restaurant.  Not At All What I Expect From A 5 Star Establishment.  Reception And Porter Staff Much Better.,,,,,
,3881,Osham Was Very Helpful  Booking Spa Treatments For Me.,,,,,
,3883,Federico And All The Staff Went Out Of Their Way To Help Us In Every Way Possible.,,,,,
,3885,All The Staff Were Brilliant.  Polly And Heather Were Particularly Good.  The Guys That Do The Ferrets And Chickens Were Great Too.  Caroline From The Bistro Was Superb Expecially As The Bistro Seemed Pretty Under Staffed Most Of The Time And She Could Have Done With Some Help!,,,,,
,3888,The Manager For The Free Gnts In Light Of Our Engagement,,,,,
,3889,Your Team Were Excellent Throughout Our Stay. They Were Not Stuffy In Any Way And Really Made You Feel At Home And Were Attentive When Required. They Tried To Keep Everything Light Hearted And We Really Liked That. You Have One Crazy/Funny Waitress Whose Name I Forget Who Was Great And Kept All Of Her Guests Laughing.,,,,,
,3892,The Reception Team Including The Door Staff Were Very Friendly. The Bar Staff Were Quite Slow  Even Though When We Arrived  Most People Had Already Moved Into The Dining Room And There Didn't Appear To Be Much Activity,,,,,
,3895,The Reception Staff On Arrival Were Very Friendly.  I Would Say That There Was A Gentlemen Who Was Serving Breakfast On The 16/10/2012 Who Had A Terrible Cold - He Should'nt Have Been In A Restaraunt.  When We Arrived He Had Dew On The End Of His Nose And He Was Constantly Blowing His Nose And Coughing.  He Was Clearly Very Ill And It Was Very Off Putting While Eating Our Breakfast....It Put Us Off Eating The Food He Was Bringing Out To Us.  The Manager/Supervisor Should Either Of Sent Him Home Or Re-Allocated His Duties To Non-Client Facing,,,,,
,3897,Chris Who Looked After Us When We Had Finished Our Evening Meal Polly Was Very Efficient And Helpful When Making The Booking,,,,,
,3899,Craig He Was Extrememly Enthusiastic At All Times And Took Us On An Excellent 2 Hour Walk On The Moors - Best Walk Ever.,,,,,
,3901,Craig Who Took Us For A Guided Walk Up The Tor Was A Very Pleasant Companion And We Enjoyed Our Walk Very Much With Him.  The Young Lady Who Looked After Beaky The Parrot Was Particularly Welcoming; Friendly And Attentive Throughout Our Stay.  She Was The One Person Who Spoke To Us As We Left To Say She Hoped We Had Had A Pleasant Stay And Hoped That We Would Return.    Having Enjoyed Very Good Service Throughout Our Stay We Were Shocked That On Paying Our Bill We Were Not Asked If We Had Enjoyed Our Stay  In Fact We Were Hardly Acknowledged - We Rather Felt They Were Pleased To See The Back Of Us!,,,,,
,3907,The Lady Who Was The Sommelier Was Lovely. Also The Lady Who Looked After Us For Afternoon Tea Was Very Attentive. The Bar Manager However Was Dreadful. He Needs To Learn How To Be More Organised And How To Communicate,,,,,
,3913,All Of The Team Members Were Very Efficient And Friendly.,,,,,
,3915,We Were Less Satisfied With The Young Girl In The Children's Play Barn Who Did Not Introduce Herself To The Children When She Arrived With Her Coffee At 10.20 Am And Also Spent 20 Minutes 'Doing Facebook' On Her Iphone Before Speaking To Anyone - Not Professional!!!,,,,,
,3916,John  (Resort Team) Who Helped With Arrangements Prior To Our Stay Was Excellent And Went Out Of His Way To Help,,,,,
,3926,Most Were Excellent  Apart From The Receptionist Who Dealt With The Issue Of No Hot Water In The Room. I Didn't Feel That She Handled To Situation As Efficiently As She Could Have.,,,,,
,3927,Everyone Was So Pleasant And Helpful. The Children Loved 'Beaky's Mummy' Who Was Always Ready To Play With Them. Molly  In The Creche  Was Very Lovely  We Felt Very Comfortable Leaving The Children With Her  They Had A Super Time With All The Wonderful Toys. And Of Course  Federico Was A Wonderful Manger Who Took Great Care To Ensure We Had A Very Relaxing Stay.,,,,,
,3930,The Head Waiter/Manager (Romania Chap) In The Edwardian Grill - Very Engaging With Us Both At Dinner Time And At Breakfast And The Waiter That Served Our Bread At Dinner Time - Very Pleasant.,,,,,
,3931,Rebecca And The Other Lady With The Long Blonde Hair Who Both Helped Me Out Over The Course Of Our Company Day. Rebeccas Went Out Of Her Way To Help Us Put Our Name Place Cards Etc When The Tables Were A Bit Delayed In Getting Set Up.  I Want To Thank The Head Chef And Pastry Chef For Their Work On Our Cake In Rescuing It From The Disaster We Had Once Delivered By A Member Of Our Staff. Thanks 'Cause Nobody Noticed In The Evening!,,,,,
,3932,Adam For The Archery Was Very Attentive. Amy For The Cider Making Was Also Great.,,,,,
,3933,The Gentleman From Hungary Who Served Us Tea And Drinks At Night Was Exceptional. He Spent Time Talking To Us About The Area  The Castle And Drinks Etc. He Treated Us More Like Friends Than Paying Guests. Sorry I Can't Remember His Name But He Had Been There 5-6 Years I Believe And Was From Hungary.,,,,,
,3934,I Disagreed Here As We Were Both Taken Aback By The Manager's Lack Of Interest In The Dining Room Problems. I Also Think If He Invites Guests To Join Him For A Glass Of Champagne  He Should Then Honour That Invitation. He Didn't.,,,,,
,3935,On Our Arrival There Was Supposed To Be A Bottle Of Champagne In The Room - Which We Didn't Get. And Then On Checking Out We Had It On Our Bill. Extremely Disappointed To See That. Unprofessional,,,,,
,3939,The Gentleman Who Served Us Cocktails Made Us Feel Extremely Welcome And Had Very Good Customer Service. Well Done!,,,,,
,3940,The Bar Manager Was Excellent  Very On The Ball  And The Tall Lady Who Served In The Restaurant And Lounges Was Also Very Attentive.,,,,,
,3941,John And Verity Were Exceptionally Attentive And Accomodating.,,,,,
,3945,We Requested A Golf Car As Our Daughter Is Disabled And Walks With Difficulty. It Would Have Made Our Life Much Easier Going From The Lodge To Anywhere. We Were Told That There Were None Available But That Someone Would Get Back To Us. Noone Has...,,,,,
,3951,All Of The Team At Bovey Castle Always Go Above And Beyond The Call Of Duty. Karina And Fed Are Regular Faces And Always Superb  But It Is Unfair To Single Any One Person Out For Being Better Than Any Other.,,,,,
,3952,We Would Especially Like To Thank Holly And Olivia Who Looked After Us At Afternoon Tea - Very Attentive  Polite And Even Ensured The Dog Had A Bowl Of Water. Thank You Ladies!,,,,,
,3953,Verity Olivia And Frederico And The Chap In The Restaurant From Eastern Europe Sorry I Don't Know His Name,,,,,
,3954,The General Training  Knowledge And Attitude Of The Staff Left A Lot To Be Desired.  The One Exception Was  I Believe  A Spanish Chap Who Appeared Part Of The Management Team - Who Was Excellent.,,,,,
,3955,Mr Federico Was Such A Lovely Guy We Saw And Heard Him Dealing With A Young Child And Thought He Was Wonderful  Made Us Feel Very Special  Was Very Knowledgable And Couldnt Do Enough For Us Always With A Smile  Also A Gentlman In The Oak Bar Serving Drinks Was Very Attentive To Ourselves And Our Dog Twiglet Who Can I Say Thought The Whole Weekend Was Just Amazing And Wants To Come Back To Make Friends With The Owl On Reception!!!!!!!,,,,,
,3956,Mr Federico Was A Lovely Smilie Guy Very Attentive And Professional,,,,,
,3957,Reception Team Were Very Friendly,,,,,
,3962,Federico Very Friendly And Helpful,,,,,
,3963,It Was Clear That All Staff Did Their Best To Ensure Guests Were Made To Feel Special  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,3964,The Bistro Staff And Reception Staff Were All Very Polite And Helpful.  The Edwardian Grill Was Not All A Good Experience  The Staff Seemed Rushed Of Their Feet And Had No Time To Serve You.  This Was Not 5 Star Service Or Fine Dining.,,,,,
,3965,In Terms Of Edwardian Grill Restaurant Wine Watress Was Excellent  But Felt The Other Staff Were Polite But Cold.,,,,,
,3967,Frederico,,,,,
,3968,Lad At The Archery Was Great  Funny And Nothing Was A Problem For Him  Amy At The Cider Making Was Also A Laugh And Made It Thoroughly Enjoyable.,,,,,
,3970,I Thought The Hotel Manager Was Excellent. The Ladies On Reception Were Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,3971,Ben. For Drive Mg My Kids To The Lodge After The Survival Camp! Thanks!,,,,,
,3974,Adam  And Frederico The Manager,,,,,
,3975,All Of The Staff Were Absolutely Wonderful  Always Greeted You By Name Which Was Most Impressive And Always Went Out Of Their Way To Help. Two New Members Of Staff Had Just Started Last Week When We Arrived And They Also Gave A Wonderful Service And Were Very Polite And Professional.,,,,,
,3976,We Found Most Of The Staff Extremely Helpful And Courteaous. However There Was One Waiter Who Was Below Par At Breakfast  Our Tea Was Incorrect  There Was No Butter On The Table  When I Asked For Condiments He Said 'Ok' Then Never Brought Them Over. On A Final Note He Kept Saying 'Brilliant' At The End Of Every Exchange.,,,,,
,3977,The Restaurant Manager In The Bistro And Main Dining Room Was Fantastic - Italian Guy.,,,,,
,3989,The Blond Waiter In The Library Had A Fantastic Knowledge Of The Whiskeys Available  Sorry I Don't Know His Name.  He Was Also Very Enthusiastic About Drink In General And It Was Very Infectious  He Was Fab!,,,,,
,3990,Adam,,,,,
,3991,Spa Manager Very Accommodations And The Staff Who Looked After Us At Breakfast Efficient And Couteous,,,,,
,3994,Fredrico - Manager. Always A Very Warm Welcome And Very Professional Never Hiding Away And Always On The Move.,,,,,
,3995,The Manager And Lady Waitress At Breakfast  Sorry I Don't Know Their Names. Both Were Super Friendly And Great With Our Son,,,,,
,3996,Your Team Really Made The Place Something Special,,,,,
,3997,The Tall Man Who Carried All Our Luggage To The Car  He Was Very Kind. All Were Exceptional And Friendly,,,,,
,3998,As Per Previous Comment - In General Staff Are Not Attentive Or Coordinated In Any Way An Example Was Lunch In The Bar - We Ordered A Drink And Waited 20Mins For It To Come  We Asked For A Lunch/Bar Menu And It Was Brought  After Much Flagging Down And Multiple Attempts To Get Someones Attention 1 Hour Later We Ordered Lunch - If That Is Attentive Staff Then I Am Stunned! Unfortunately This Seemed To Be The Overall Approach,,,,,
,3999,The Manager Was Very Attentive And Accommodating. Once He Discovered We Were Celebrating Our 1St Anniversary He Arranged Champagne And Chocolates For Us Which Was A Lovely Touch.  I Couldn't Fault Any Of The Staff.,,,,,
,4000,The Welsh Bar Man And The Young Lady In The Car Park Were Warm And Engaged In Conversation Making The Service More Personable.  The Other Staff Were All Polite But Were Either Lacking The Social Ability Or Desire To Make Pleasantries Which Created A Rather Distant And Aloof /Cool Service Which Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,4003,The Slovenian Waiter At Dinner Was Lovely. Don't Know His Name But He Was Really Nice And Funny When He Came For A Chat.,,,,,
,4007,The Receptionist Was Very Helpful When Booking.,,,,,
,4008,Federico Was Particularly Friendly And Attentive.,,,,,
,4009,The Manager Was Extreamly Freindly And Cool.,,,,,
,4010,Craig Was Particularly Helpful And Enthusiastic,,,,,
,4019,Mr Rata And Federico,,,,,
,4023,No  But The Staff In General Were Outstanding.  So Friendly.,,,,,
,4025,It Is A Credit To The Team That I Actually Struggle To Put Any One Person Ahead Of The Others - Every Single Member Of Staff Was Very Welcoming And Made Us Feel Like Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,4026,Federico (Sp?) Was Exceptionally Professional Whilst I Don't Feel His Staff Was Always So Switched On  Or In The Case Of Aforementioned Gentleman At Breakfast  Suited To The Service Industry.,,,,,
,4027,Staff At Front Door/Reception  Excellant,,,,,
,4028,Ben From Archery Was Very Good Indeed.,,,,,
,4031,The Young Chap Behind The Bar With Glasses Was Always Cheerful And V Helpful,,,,,
,4037,I Came Down To The Sitting Room At 5.30Pm And Asked For Cream Tea. I Was Told That They Were No Longer Serving Tea. This Was Disappointing. A Hotel Of This Stature Should Be Prepared To Serve Cream Tea At 3Pm If A Guest So Wishes.,,,,,
,4041,Falconer Martin....... A Stupendous Experience..... Even In The Rain.... Simply Amazing!!,,,,,
,4044,Amy Was Great Company On Our Guided Walk And Osh Was Most Helpful With The Bicycles. Tom The Shotgun Man Was A Great Teacher On The Shooting Range - Thanks Again To Him. The Whole Staff Were Friendly And Extremely Welcoming  Thank You.,,,,,
,4050,The Management Were Not As Friendly Or Helpful Ad The General Staff,,,,,
,4052,The Reception Staff Were Very Polite.  You Might Want To Check The Spelling Of 'Courteous' Above!!!,,,,,
,4054,Both Ben And The Guy Who Took The Children's Rafting Activity Were Excellent As I Discussed With Reception When I Checked Out. Also The Edwardian Grill Staff Were Fantastic At All Times,,,,,
,4056,No  But You Might Want To Spell Check Courteous!,,,,,
,4057,There Were Five Or Six Members Of Staff Who Really Looked After Us All Weekend Particularly On The Reception/Concierge Desk - I'm So Sorry I Can't Remember Names! - It Was The Second May Bank Holiday And They Were Superb!  It Was Also Lovely That The Manager Was Very Visible All Weekend  And Personally Checked With Us A Couple Of Time That All Was Good With Our Stay.  Susannah In The Play Room Was Also Wonderful With Our Little Boy Who Was A Bit Scared Of Staying By Himself - She Made Him Feel Welcome And Really At Ease  And Brought Him Back Over To The Hotel When Later In The Afternoon He'd Had Enough!  Thank You To All The Staff At Bovey For Making Our Weekend Really Special - Great Service And Really Lovely Personal Touches.,,,,,
,4062,All Of The Staff We Came Across Were Lovely  In Fact This May Be One Of The Best Hotels We Have Stayed In As Regards The Staff Getting The Balance Just Right.  They Seemed To Always Be There When We Needed Something Without Ever Seeming To Hover In An Intrusive Way.  How Do You Do It ?!  So Many Places Get This Wrong.,,,,,
,4065,All Members Of Staff Were Very Friendly. It Was Good To See The Hotel Manager On Numerous Occasions Taking An Active Interest In The Hotel And The Guests.,,,,,
,4066,Manager Federico Aresti - Made Time To Make Us Feel Welcome And Valued. Diane - The Lady Who Took My Husband And Children For Archery And Air Rifle Shooting - Very Friendly And Encouraging.,,,,,
,4067,Had A Few Bad Waiters But Overall People Were Great. Katirina Is Awesome Oshan Is Great. Karen Sweet Federico Great Martin Good Guy,,,,,
,4068,The Chaps At The Front We Very Helpful With Anything We Required From Helping With Bags  Moving The Car To Answering All Sorts Of Questions. They Are Right At The Front Of The Experience And Did A Comendable Job,,,,,
,4069,Tracy In Playbarn Fed The Manager! Girls On Reception,,,,,
,4071,The Manager  Federico  Appears To Be An Endless Source Of Friendliness  Assistance & General Presence Supporting His Staff Fantastically.  All Staff That We Had Dealings With Were Faultless. Giving A Friendly  Efficient Service. Requests Were Dealt With Incredibly Quickly. Even If I Really Tried  I Could Not Find Anything To Fault Any One Of Them.,,,,,
,4072,Thanks To Amy And Verity Who Made Sure Our Children Had A Great Few Days :),,,,,
,4081,Most Of The Rest Of The Staff Were Friendly  I Cant Say I Was Made To Feel Completely Welcome When We Had Afternoon Tea In The Bar Area. I Also Didnt Understand Why So Many Tables Were Reserved And Not Used For The Entire Time We Were There  Seems A Waste Of Time To Me And Off Putting For Other Guests!,,,,,
,4085,When We Arrived To Our Room We Went To Make A Cup Of Tea And Found We Had Proper Milk Instead Of Uht So I Was Happy As I Hate Uht  But When We Poured It Out It Had Gone Off And Came Out In A Lump!! I Rang Down To Reception And The Lady Just Said 'Oh Ill Get Some More Sent Up To You'  She Did Not Even Say Sorry  And It Was Not Very Nice Pouring Off Milk Into Your Cup And It Splashed On My Shorts  So Its Not Something I Really Would Have Expected In This Type Of Hotel. Generally The Staff Were Pleasant But Some Were Pleasnat In A Genuine Way And Soem Seemed Bored And Not Very Caring,,,,,
,4086,Becky In The Castle Bistro. Very Friendly And Attentive,,,,,
,4090,The Contract Window Cleaner He Was The Most Helpfull In The Hotel,,,,,
,4093,They Were All Very Professional  The Young Lady (Taller Blond) Who Help Us On Our Way Out Sourced Some Apples And Water For Our Trip; That Was Very Nice.,,,,,
,4095,We Had Very Little Contact With The Team,,,,,
,4102,Dining Room Team The Young Manager With Dark Hair/Mediterranean,,,,,
,4103,Adam He Is Very Good,,,,,
,4104,Overall Didn't Feel That Staff Were As Friendly As On Previous Visits.,,,,,
,4108,The Concierges Did Not Even Greet.,,,,,
,4109,I Complained About The Bed Situation On The Wednesday Evening And The Member Of Staff On Reception Visited Our Room. Whilst He Agreed That The Bed Was Disgraceful And Apologised And Explained That This Was His First Day Back Off Holiday And That He Wasn't In A Position To Do Anything About It. At This Point I Asked My Wife  Who Was Upset  If She Wanted To Go Home. We Decided To Stay And Complain To A Member Of The Management Team In The Morning. The Employee Stated That He Would Write A Report And Confirmed That Room 10 Is Used As A Twin Room. He Also Confirmed That The Hotel Had Just Over 20 Residents Staying And Was Therefore Quiet! I Am Utterly Disgusted That We Were Given A Twin Room For Our Honeymoon. Clearly This Room Was Not Fit For Purpose.,,,,,
,4111,There Was A Gentleman  I Think His Name Was Alex  He Was Very Helpful & Friendly. He Was Happy To Help With Any Requests And Showed Us Around. He Was Welsh And Had Previously Been In The Armed Services.,,,,,
,4113,I Felt As Though Someone Was Always Watching Me - The Whole Experience Was Creepy. Although The Staff Were Very Polite - There Just Seemed To Be A Lot Of Staff Compared To Guests.,,,,,
,4114,All The Staff Were Excellent  Pleasant And The Whole Atmosphere Of The Castle Was Relaxing.,,,,,
,4115,All Staff Were Excellent. A Young Lad (Of Whose Name I Cannot Recall But Which Was Unusual And Began With An 'O' I Believe!!) Who Parked Our Car Initially And Then Surprisingly Lead The Archery Activity The Next Day Was Brilliant. A Testament To The Overall Experience And A Good Ambassador For Bovey..,,,,,
,4121,Everyone Was Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,4127,Ben For Being So Patient And Good With The Children,,,,,
,4129,No,,,,,
,4133,I Didn't Get Her Name But There Was A Lovely Waitress In The Edwardian Grill Who Was Very Friendly And Helpful. Many Members Of Staff Would Walk Through The Main Rooms And Bar Area Downstairs And Ask If You Were Ok And If There Was Anything You Needed Which Was Nice. The Staff Were Also Very Good With Stoking Up The Wonderful Log Fires! The Guy Who Did The Falconry Display In The Morning Was Also Very Good.,,,,,
,4135,The Cheese Waiter He Was Very Attentive And Made Sure He Could Find Out What Cheese's My Partner Could Not Eat.,,,,,
,4140,Fed - For Just Always Trying To Be Helpful And Mucking In With The Other Staff  And The Sommelier Who Looked After Us Well On My Sisters Birthday. I Will Also Mention The Staff At Breakfast - They Do A Good Job At Sometimes Incredibly Busy Times,,,,,
,4142,Both Sommeliers!!!! George & Katerina. They Were Fantastic.,,,,,
,4151,Impressed With The General Manager As He Made Efforts To Engage With The Guests And Accommodate Requests.,,,,,
,4152,All Excellent - Top Marks Federico!,,,,,
,4153,Very Professional And Polite / Attentive. The Most Memorable Part Of The Stay Besides The Castle Itself.,,,,,
,4159,Federico Has To Have A Big Mention For Me. As This Manager Has 101 Things Going On All At The Same Time And Has To Be Dealt With In Such A Highly Professional Manner. But Still Makes Sure To Find Time To Spend With Making Sure His Guests Feel That They Are The Most Important Thing To Him As He Stops To Speak.,,,,,
,4160,The Manager Who Was Friendly  Attentive And Professional And The Guy Who Parked My Car. I Particularly Liked Meeting  Was Impressed By  The Falconer,,,,,
,4162,Frederico Was Brilliant...When Does He Ever Sleep?  We Were Very Impressed That He Knew How Long We Were Staying And Sent Up Room Temperate Bottled Water For Our Baby.  All Of The Staff Were Great And We Were Really Impressed With Osheen Who Remembered Our Son's Name And We Enjoyed His Tour Of The Hotel And Seeing The Ferrets And Hens.  We Are Also Beaky's Greatest Fans!  I Think You Must Really Invest In Your Staff And Look After Them In Order To Create Such A Lovely Caring Atmosphere For Guests - The Staff Must Feel Really Cherished Themselves In Order To Deliver Such A Lovely Service,,,,,
,4163,Maintenance : On Demand Movies Were Not Working But The Effort Put In Was Exceptional Aslo The Speed,,,,,
,4170,Ben In The Dining Room Was Lovely And Obviously Cared That Our Dining Experience Had A Couple Of Mishaps  But Was Soon To Correct Them. Thanks Ben!,,,,,
,4172,Staff Seemed Too Busy In The Restaurants To Be Attentive To My And Other Dinners' Needs - Requiring That Dinners Leave Their Tables To Go And Ask For Menus / Info On Dishes / Bills Etc.  Very Annoying.  Staff In All Other Departments Were Very Impressive.,,,,,
,4174,Hotel Manager Was Very Kind And Courteous And Always Went Out Of His Way To Make Things Possible,,,,,
,4175,More Perfect Than That  Is Not Easy To Find. Thanks Again  In The Name Of Our Whole Group  For The Personal Service.,,,,,
,4176,Excellent Staff At Reception. Could Not Do Enough To Please Us,,,,,
,4177,No One Was Exceptional. Some Of The Back Office Foreign Staff Were Very Poor.,,,,,
,4186,As Always Taff  A Cracking Guy. Also Becky Running The Bar Under Tough Circumstances Ie Our Party Group.,,,,,
,4192,Sammy On Reception And Of Course Martin,,,,,
,4198,The Service At Bovey Really Stood Out !,,,,,
,4199,They Were All Equally Great,,,,,
,4201,Found All To Be Equally Helpfully And Friendly.,,,,,
,4203,But Not Very Interested......,,,,,
,4205,The Staff Who Greeted Us On Arrival And At Reception. The Bar Man On Sunday Night,,,,,
,4209,Service At Dinner Was Superb  Chap On The Front Door Who Brought Our Bags In Is A Credit To You!,,,,,
,4210,All Professional Excellent Service Again A Total 5* Experience Thank You All,,,,,
,4211,All Staff That We Came Across Were Attentive And Very Helpful.  We Also Noticed That They Were Like This With All Other Guests Too,,,,,
,4212,There Was Very Little That Was 'Personal' From The Staff,,,,,
,4213,Staff Were Fantastic With The Exception Of One Of The Waiting Staff In The Bistro Who Distant And Unwelcoming.,,,,,
,4218,Lady At Bistro .Duty Manager ? Was Very Good. Frederico Very Friendly As Previous. Guy That Does The Ferrets And Front Of House Also Very Welcoming.,,,,,
,4223,Federico Was Wonderful And Really Looked After Us. Very Attentive.,,,,,
,4225,No,,,,,
,4230,The Waitress In The Bistro. I Would Suggest That The Reception Team Acknowledge Guests When They Walk Past The Desk  If They Are Not On The Phone Or Otherwise Engaged  Even If Only To Look Up And Smile. All The Other Staff Were Very Nice And The Cleaner Made An Effort And Said Good Morning To Us. There Was One Waitress In The Edwardian Grill Who We Felt Was Not Overly Friendly.,,,,,
,4232,Kim In The Spa Was Very Attentive And I Really Enjoyed My Treatment. Did Not Learn The Names Of Anyone Else.,,,,,
,4236,I Would Like To Acknowledge The Breafast Manageress  She Was Very Friendly  Professional And Efficient And Came Across Has A Very Nice Genuine Person. I Did However  Expect More From The Staff. It Was Evident That Some Lacked Training And Understanding Of The English Language. I Pay For Five Star Treatment  I Expect To Recieve It And Unfortunately  I Recieved Too Many Apologies  Which  Quite Frankly  Made My Recent Visit Disappointing.,,,,,
,4237,The Reception Staff Were Very Good But The Overall Staffing Experience Was Spoilt By The Restaurant Staff.,,,,,
,4239,Some Of The Staff Were Truly Lovely But There Was One Waitress In The Edwardian Grill Who Made Us Feel Quite Unwelcome.,,,,,
,4241,This Is One Of My Foibles; I Like People To Be As Courteous To Me As Is Honest. Occasionally  This Is Overbearing And Comes Across As Being Disingenuous - It Probably Isn't Meant That Way. They Have Probably Been Directed To Be Too Courteous. Arabella Was Excellent In The Spa. I Know Her Name Because She Told Me So. Two Other Ladies Waiting On Were Exceptional As Well  But I Do Not Know Their Names Because They Weren't Mentioned And  It Should Be Borne In Mind  Ladies Tend To Have Their Name Badges In An Inappropriate Place  For Gentlemen To Be Seen To Be Taking Notice!  Arabella Was Courteous; Thorough  Without Being Vigorous  Relaxed Without Being Unprofessional And Generally  A Credit To The Hotel.,,,,,
,4242,General Manager Of The Hotel And The Edwardian Grill Manager ~ Beyond Excellent!!!,,,,,
,4243,Chris Who Did The Archery And Shooting Was Very Good With All Of The Family And Even Went Out Of His Way To Have A Conversation At A Different Time When We Saw Him In The Grounds.  The Front Door Staff Were Lovely.  Good Team Spirit And Generally All Working Off The Same Hymn Sheet.,,,,,
,4245,I Thought Everyone Was Very Polite And Courteous.,,,,,
,4246,The Young Men That Ran The Children's Archery And Clay Pigeon Shooting Were Great To My Children.,,,,,
,4255,Everyone At The Bistro!  A Fantastic Team  Very Friendly And Extremely Helpful In Any Request.  Fantastic Food And Service.  Service At The Grill Could Improve And Was Probably The One Weak Point  But Others More Than Made Up For That.  Local Dining Recommendations Were Excellent And The Rugglestone Inn Was A Particular Favorite.  Our Kids Really Liked Osh And Amy (Who Joined Us On Several Walks) And Absolutely Loved The Falconry Experience With Martin.  Raft Building And Archery Got High Marks As Well.  We Appreciated The Help From Celia To Organize Our Activities And Federico Checked On Us Several Times To Make Sure That We Were Having A Pleasant Stay  Asking If We Needed Anything.  In All Of Our Travels  Very Few Places Have Compared To Bovey Castle For Service Excellence.  We Thoroughly Enjoyed Out Stay And Would Certainly Return.  It Was A Great Experience For Our Family.,,,,,
,4256,Ahmed Was Very Helpful In The Grill  Setting Up A Table Outside For Us One Evening Which Was Perfect. Matt Was Exceptional  Being Friendly Without Being Over Familiar  Generous And Helpful  And Giving Us All A Ride On A Golf-Buggy!,,,,,
,4257,Debbie In The Spa  Superb At Her Job. Frederico  Very Helpful.,,,,,
,4262,Katrina The Wine Lady And The Senior Staff Bloke (?Concierge) With Sharp Sideburns.  Both Were Very Good At Making Sure We Had What We Needed And Went Over And Above To Achieve This.,,,,,
,4263,Let Down By The Dining Experience When The Wedding Party Was In The Bistro.  There Seemed To Be No Decision Makers Around And Mixed Messages About What To Do.,,,,,
,4264,They Were All Excellent,,,,,
,4269,Craig And Ben Were Just Great! Despite Having Clearly Done The Archery/Air Rifle Sessions A Million Time Before  They Treated Us So Well  With Enthusiasm And Charm.  Federico---Uncannily Ubiquitous. I Noted His Total Concentration And All-Seeing Eye. Some Guests Next To Me In The Bar Were Getting Restive Because Their Dinner Order Hadn't Been Taken--Federico Poked His Nose Inside The Room And Instantly Said 'Has Mr And Mrs's Order Been Taken?'  Cue Instant Rushing Over Of Waiter. Well Done!,,,,,
,4271,Lads. He Was A Porter  Driver  Achery Teacher  Etc.. Very Nice And Helpful.,,,,,
,4272,All Were Excellent However One Lady In The Bistro Took Our Six Week Old Son For 15 Minutes And This Was Mind Blowing To Us That Your Staff Would Care For Their Guests So Much. The Bistro Team Simply Need A Leader As They Are All Excellent.,,,,,
,4273,One Evening We Came To The Bar And Had To Wait Ca. 10 Minutes Before We Were Attended Because The Barmaid  Who Had Seen Us Walking Into The Bar  Was Talking To Guests - Which Is Generally A Good Thing But Not If This Means Other Guests Are Ignored. There Was Another Couple Who Had Been Waiting To Order Even Longer.,,,,,
,4274,Not Sure If This Refers To The Spa -If So All Were Excellent. If Regarding All Other Sstaff - They Were So Inattentive At Breakfast That After Waiting Fir 10 Minutes For Fresh Fruit Atthe Buffet Table I Returned To Find Dirty Plates Still On Our Table - I Put Them On The Floor.,,,,,
,4279,Everyone Was Very Helpful And Polite.I Didn't Catch Her Name  But One Lady Even Dropped A Bag Of Snacks That I Left At The Castle Off At My B & B In Mortenhampstead On Her Way Home - Above And Beyond The Call Of Duty!,,,,,
,4282,Katrina - Wine Waitress  Enthusiastic  Smiling  Knowledgeable Amy - Who Welcomed Us At The Beginning  Enthusiastic  Very Happy All Dinner Staff At Edwardian Grill  Excellent,,,,,
,4283,Not Really  As All Were Very Good (See Prev Comments).,,,,,
,4285,Could Be So Much Better  The Initial Greeting Was Good  However We Were Told It Would Be £40 A Night For An Upgrade And A 45 Minute Wait  So Kept To Our Original Room  Could Have Offered It Free As You Were Not Busy  Would Have Been A Nice Touch And Cost You Nothing,,,,,
,4286,Craig Was Brilliant. He Took Us For Archery And Was Very Professional But Friendly. The Hotel Manager (I Think) Greeted Us On Arrival And Was Brilliant And Very Funny. All Staff Were Friendly And Not Stuffy Which Put Everyone At Ease.,,,,,
,4289,No One Stood Out  But Having Experienced Hotels Around The World  I Had A Sense Of Inexperience And A Distinct Lack Of Polish From A Young Team.,,,,,
,4290,The Reception Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful Elsewhere Very Little Evidence Of Managers Appauling Service At Breakfast No Where Near Enough Staff On Duty And Those That Were Not Trained Well Enough,,,,,
,4291,Italian Manager Federico Is Very Kind And Professional,,,,,
,4294,Rebecca As Previously Mentioned  She Is The Reason We Chose Bovey Over Gidleigh Park.,,,,,
,4297,Emily & Hannah Were Very Professional  Polite & Attentive. Fedarico Was Very Helpful With Wine Choices.,,,,,
,4299,All The Team - David Was Superb At Dinner As Were The Conference Staff Through Out The Day,,,,,
,4301,The Maitre D' - As Mentioned In The Context Of The Dining Experience.,,,,,
,4304,The Manager Was Superb. All Staff Very Good,,,,,
,4307,We Did Not Meet Anybody.,,,,,
,4308,The Hotel Manager Was Attentive  Friendly And Knowledgeable. He Also Seemed To Work All Hours. He Definitely Made A Difference To Our Stay.,,,,,
,4309,The Restaurant Manager (Scottish Gentleman) Was Excellent.,,,,,
,4310,The Student Matt Who Drove To The Pub And Rita In The Spa Both Very Professional,,,,,
,4313,All Very Good,,,,,
,4314,Magda Who Worked On The Bar Was Very Pleasant And Helpful.,,,,,
,4316,We Found Most Of The Staff Above Average In Their Dealings With Us.  Federico Was Very Attentive And Charming Which A Good Hotel Needs Above All Else.  The Castle Has Much To Offer And We Did Enjoy Our Stay And Intend To Come Again.  Any Comments Made Have Been Made Only For Constructive Purposes And Not In Any Way Complaint.,,,,,
,4318,The Lady Who Dealt With Us When I Complained About The Room - Very Professional.,,,,,
,4319,Without Exception Every Member Of Staff Greeted Us Warmly And Was Engaing With My Family.,,,,,
,4323,No One Cared About My Situation. Not One Person Reached Out To Assist... Just Offered Me A Helicopter Ride Back To London - Really???  No Help With Phone Or Communications. Drove Me To Tears - Literally. Unable To Find Full Day Activity For The Kids. Never Even Told About The Little  Putt Putt Course Right Outside!! They Said They Were Setting Up The Wii  But Never Heard From Anyone Again. And Then You Have The Audacity To Charge On Final Bill A Tip For Over Priced  Under Taught Kids 90 Minute Activities - Never Previously Mentioned. Never Brought Milk Up After The Kids Went To Get Their Own.  Boys Brought It From Breakfast The Next Day. Room Service Trays Sat In Room For Full Next Day - No Clear Away. Sloppy  Lazy Staff.,,,,,
,4324,The Staff Were Very Helpful And Even When Things Went Wrong Were Very Professional.  Not Sure Why Breakfast Went So Wrong As There Were A Lot Of Staff Around And Only 6 Tables At The Time.,,,,,
,4326,Sorry Didnt Get Her Name But A Very Helpful And Friendly Woman Who Was Hosting At The Brasserie. Expecting Quite Soon But Still Full Of Energy!,,,,,
,4327,The Team Were Really Nice & Friendly  But Seemed To Lack A Level Of Attention To Detail.,,,,,
,4328,Sorry I Did Not Make Note Of Names But All Were Great  Reception Staff Are Brilliant  Welcoming Smile At All Time  Made A Difference!,,,,,
,4331,Federico Aresti Was Absolutely Outstanding.  He Is A Great Asset To The Property.  Our Arrival Into Exeter And Bovey Were Very Unsatisfactory  But Frederico's Outstanding Attention To Our Issues And The Resolution Of Those Issues Was The Single Reason That Our Stay Finished With A Rating Of Fantastic.,,,,,
,4336,Some Staff Were Surly.  Staff In Bar Not Profficient  Sugar Should Come With The Tea And Coffee And When Asked It Should Not Be That You Are Putting Them Out If They Have To Go Back For Sugar.  Unfortunately  My Score Here Is Based On This Person....,,,,,
,4338,We Took Part In The Archery  - Alex? He Was Very Friendly And Helpful Even To Me As A Novice Against The Boys. Really Enjoyed The Activity.,,,,,
,4341,If  Only I Had Made A Note Of Names.  Pre- Dinner Drinks ( And We Were The Only Ones For A While) Was Extremely Slow.,,,,,
,4342,A Very Important Element In Choosing To Come To Bovey Castle Was The Playbarn And Childcare Facility. The First Two Days Were Excellent With Suzanne In Charge And Lily  My Daughter  Had A Lovely Time. I Was Very Frustrated  However  That The Second Two Days Of Our Stay Were Difficult Because There Was No-One Available On Suzanne's Days Off  Even Though I Had Let Staff Know I Was Depending On Childcare (On The Wednesday As I Had A Spa Treatment Booked). Eventually Someone Else Was Found To Cover The Playbarn  But I Had To Leave Lily Behind Reception Hoping That She'd Be Ok When I Went For My Treatment. At Least A Solution Was Found  But I Did Feel That My Concerns (Voiced On Three Occasions Including The Time Of Booking The Treatment) Hadn't Been Heeded  As Staff Didn't Really Check Whether There Would Be Someone To Cover The Childcare When I Asked Them.,,,,,
,4346,Excellent Service - All The Staff Were Very Friendly And Professional.,,,,,
,4347,Unfortunately When I Sought Help For An Emergency Dental Appointment The Receptionist Was Particularly Unhelpful - Basically Suggestion I Had No Chance Of Getting An Appointement Locally And My Best Bet Might Be To Try Exeter. I Had To Go To The Bistro To Use The Mobile Booster Hub - Do My Own Investigations And Within 10 Minutes Had Booked An Appointment For Myself For Later That Morning At A Superb Dental Practice In Chagford - Who Said They Regularly Had Referrals From Bovey Castle ....,,,,,
,4348,As Mentioned Previously  We Would Like To Acknowledge Becca In The Castle Bistro For Her Excellent Level Of Service.,,,,,
,4351,Two People  The First Was The Young Blonde Lady Dressed In Tweed That Meet Us At The Door And Showed Us Our Room She Just Made My Wife Feel At Ease From The Start With Her Friendly And Happy Approach   My Wife Does /Didn’T Like Big Posh Hotels Because She Feels She Does Not Belong So This Young Lady And Then The Rest Of Your Staff Changed Her View And Gave Her Added Confidence  The Second Was The Cleaning Manager Who With Out  A Second Thought Went And Got Us Her Fan From Her Office. Unfortunately I Didn’T Get Either Name.,,,,,
,4353,Craig Was Lovely And Very Helpful.  We Were Overlooked In The Bar Before Dinner.  We Had To Get Our Own Drinks Menu After 5 Minutes Of Trying To Catch The Waiters Eye.,,,,,
,4355,Adam - Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Him But All Were Exceptional,,,,,
,4356,We Were Particularly Impressed With 'Ben' Who Drove Us To The Falcon Experience. What Was Impressive Is How He Remembered Our Surnames Not Only On The Day  But Also The Following Day When We Met Briefly. Exceptional Recognition And Makes An Immense Difference. Your Staff On Reception Were Very Attentive And Polite At All Times.,,,,,
,4357,Maxim Was Very Attentive And Helpful During Dinner.,,,,,
,4358,Difficult To Get Attention In Bars And Lounges On Some Occasions.  Invited To Sit And Get Waiter Service  But Then Waited 20 Pkus Minutes For Waiter.,,,,,
,4359,Chap In The Bar  Name Not Known  Who Talked Us Very Knowledgeably Through The Whiskeys,,,,,
,4361,Generally Staff Did Well To Create Warm  Festive Atmosphere But Notable Exceptions Already Mentioned Re Dining.,,,,,
,4362,Concierge  The Fellas Where Great As Where The Wait Staff,,,,,
,4364,Every Member Of Staff Was Trained To The Same High Standard......... The One Saving Grace,,,,,
,4368,I Didnt Have Much Contact With Any Of The Staff As I Was Self Catering In One Of The Lodges But If I Met A Member Of Staff In Passing The Grounds Or At The Castle  They Were All Very Friendly.,,,,,
,4370,Yes The French Waiter In The Restaurant Who Had Just Started That Day The 8Th Of May,,,,,
,4375,See Comment Re Very Limited Access To Hotel,,,,,
,4376,I Would Like To Mention The Staff At Breakfast But Not To Recommend Them.  On Striking Up A General Conversation With A Waitress  My Partner Asked If De Savery Still Owned The Castle - Her Reply Was Yes.  On Finding Out That He Hadn't Actually Owned It For Over 6.  May Be A Good Idea For The Staff To Know A Little About Where They Are Working.  Also The Way She Spoke To My Partner Without A Please Or Thank You In Sight Ie  'Pass Your Plate' Was What Would Be Expected From Staff At A 'Happy Eater' Restaurant.,,,,,
,4377,As Stated You All Were Excellent   Bistro Staff Very Nice Attitude And Fredrico You Were Also Polite As Other Staff  Was Nice To Speak With You.,,,,,
,4380,Ashlie - I Was Also The Wedding Photographer And She Was Vey Helpful.,,,,,
,4382,Some Of Your Staff Are Lovely But Others Are Quite Poor. Amy  Who Led A 6 Mile Walk And The Sloe Gin Making Is Excellent. Some Of The Bistro Staff Seem Untrained And Dont Know How To Provide 5 Star Service. Menus Were Not Brought  No Salt/Pepper Etc Brought To The Table  No One Asked Me If Every Thing Was Ok With The Meals.  This Is Not 5 Star Service And It Was Made Worse By Having To Pay 12.5% Service Charge.,,,,,
,4385,One Of The Fellows Who Tends To The Chickens Is Lovely.,,,,,
,4387,Becca In The Bistro Was Friendly And Helpful,,,,,
,4388,They Were All So Nice And Helpful - I Couldn't Pick Out Just One!,,,,,
,4390,On The Whole The Staff Were Extreamley Friendly And Helpful But I Found The Waiting Staff At Breakfast To Be Rather Surly And Not Particularly Friendly Or Attentive.,,,,,
,4396,The Small Blonde Lady At Receptionwho Took Me To My Room Was Very Nice And Helpful,,,,,
,4398,Yes The Gent In The Tweeds Sorry I Have No Name,,,,,
,4400,The Manager,,,,,
,4403,Reason For Not Giving 100% Top Marks To 'Attentive' Was Because Our Dinner Drinks Order Was Forgotten.,,,,,
,4405,Corrina - So Warm And Friendly To Us,,,,,
,4408,The Bar Staff Were Very Good,,,,,
,4411,The Exclusive Resort Staff  Harry( Doorman) And David(4X4 Driver),,,,,
,4414,Adam Was Fantastic With All Of Us On The Archery Range. Patient And He Brought Down The Air Rifle For Those That Had Sore Fingers.  My Daughter Has Fallen In Love With Another Sport!  She Also Loved The Trampoline By The Range.,,,,,
,4415,No One In Particular,,,,,
,4417,Bar Staff She Was Very Helpfull To All Our Needs,,,,,
,4418,No Question  The Place Is Lovely (Stunning Even) But The Real Stars And The Reason I Would Return Tomorrow And Recommend My Friends To Do So Too Is The Staff In General. I'm Sorry I Don't Know Names But The People In The Restaurants  Bar And Reception Areas Were Beyond Good. Their Consistent Smiles And Friendliness Combined With The Apparent Fact That Nothing Is Too Much Trouble Manages To Create The Atmosphere That Makes Bovey Castle So Special. Thank You All.,,,,,
,4419,Not Positively.,,,,,
,4422,Manager  Federico. No Sherry Available  But Offered And Satisfactory Alternative. Followed Up With Progress Report. Great Customer Service.,,,,,
,4424,The Manager Frederico Aresti Was Attentive And Listened To Our Concerns,,,,,
,4425,Polly - My Son  Ben  Absolutely Adored Her.,,,,,
,4440,The Young Man Who Took Our Bag To The Room And The Hotel Manager Seemed Attentive At The Time But Hasn't Yet Emailed To Explain Why We Had Such A Disappointing Experience At The Castle Bistro.,,,,,
,4442,The Hotel Manager And Jake Were Both Extremely Helpful And Very Easy To Talk To,,,,,
,4445,Charlotte Was Extremely Good.,,,,,
,4447,We Were Very Pleased With The People Who Cleaned And Tidied Our Room - They Did A Splendid Job.,,,,,
,4449,The Lady Who Showed Us Round Was Lovely On Arrival As Were The Check In And Check Out Staff.,,,,,
,4450,Julia On The Resorts Team Was Outstanding.  Very Professional!,,,,,
,4451,Frederico Was Excellent And Made A Problem That Happened Become No Problem- Excellent Customer Service . The Gentleman In The Cocktail Bar Could Have Been More Customer Friendly But Overall Staff Were Amazing,,,,,
,4452,Matthew As Preciously Detailed.,,,,,
,4453,The Bar Was Lovely And The Staff First Class  Especially Mark Who Was Very Good With The Children  Making Cocktails.,,,,,
,4454,Sorry Cannot Remember The Names  But Waiters And Barmen Great.,,,,,
,4465,The Guys At The Front Door Were Particularly Helpful,,,,,
,4467,Excellent Staff. Can't Fault Them.,,,,,
,4477,In My Opinion Frederico Aresti Is Let Down By Staff And The  Facility,,,,,
,4478,Bar Staff Lacked Instruction And Direction  With Other Staff Members Congregating Around The Bar Area And Chatting With One Another...Very Poor,,,,,
,4479,I Wouldn't Single Out Any Particular Staff As They All Exhibited Behaviours I Found Very Appealing: A) Personally Attentive Without Being Intrusive  B) Knowledgable About Us Without Being Re-Told  Such As My Wife Having A Gluten Free Diet  And C) Being Engaging People With Interesting And Intelligent Things To Say.  One Slightly Downside Was That We Were Served Food By A Member Of Staff Who Clearly Had A Bad Cold  And That Was A Little Off-Putting.,,,,,
,4480,All The Staff Were Polite Helpful And Welcoming  Well Done To You All.,,,,,
,4481,All The Team Were Very Helpful Cheerful And Polite . The Manager For The Restaurant And The Hotel Were Both Extremely Good And Webt Out Of Their Way To Make Sure We Had All We Needed,,,,,
,4491,All The Staff.,,,,,
,4495,Sorry  I Didn't Make A Note Of Names But The Receptionists We Dealt With We're Excellent: Cheerful  Knowledgeable And Helpful.,,,,,
,4499,The Desert Chef Was Great At The Edwardian Grill. Also The Waiter At The Edwardian Grill Was Really Good-It Was His First Week Working There  Also Fredrico Was Very Friendly And Helpful,,,,,
,4500,Alex The Doorman Who Received Us Was Great,,,,,
,4503,Craig Was Very Good And Helpful  As Was The Gentleman Who Met Us From The Car And The Reception Staff.  The Waitress And Waiter In The Edwardian Grill Were Unfortunately Not Of The Same Standard - Neither Was The (Sub) Chef Who Was On Duty That Evening.,,,,,
,4505,No,,,,,
,4506,Rachel Was Very Knowledgable  The Concierge Was Very Helful As Was The Receptionist.,,,,,
,4507,The Restaurant Manager As Mentioned Previously,,,,,
,4508,The Young Man Dressed I Believe In The Red Waistcoat And Tie  That Was In The Bar And Edwardian Grill Was Excellent. Even Though We Appreciate He Didn't Know Us By Name  He Made The Supreme Effort To Make You Feel As Though He Remembered You And Was Genuinely Interested To Make Sure Everything Was As You Would Like It.,,,,,
,4510,The Valet Car Team Were Good.  The Meet And Greet Person Was Very Good,,,,,
,4511,Personally I Would Like To Mention The Hotel Manager Federico Aresti Because Over 30 Years Or Staying In Hotels Either For Business Of Pleicure I Have Never Met Such A Realy Nice Kind & Understanding Person In His Position Without His Intervention I Would Have Certainly Moved Out The Next Day Indeed I Did Have All My Bags In My Hand To Check Out When I Met Mr Aresti When He Simply Smiled At Me To Say Good Morning ? It Was At That Time I Realised He Was The Manager & Then Told Him Of My Restraunt Experiance  Which He Imediatly Delt With My Concerns After A Long Conversation He Persuaded Me To Stay On Which I Did ( 2 Rooms ) Mr Aresti Absolutely Shines In His Job He Seems To Be A People's Person And Gets The Job Done & With A Smile ? He Even Came To See Me To See How I Was Getting On When He Was Not On His Shift ? For Me Federico Aresti Made My Stay Much More Enjoyable Than It Was Prior To Meeting Him I Will Always Remember My Stay At Your Hotel Thanks To Him,,,,,
,4517,Breakfast: Tea Came 15 Min After We Finished. Hardly Any Service Available.,,,,,
,4518,No,,,,,
,4521,The Manager In The Restaurant Was Rude And Staff Failed To Respond Adequately,,,,,
,4523,We Would Like To Acknowledge The Gent That Taught Us To Shoot. We Had A Fabulous Time  He Was Very Patient And Made Us Feel Relaxed And Able To Have Fun.,,,,,
,4526,I Visited Sometime Ago; At That Time Staff Service Was Exemplary. This Time  However  There Was A Level Of Indifference That I Would Not Expect From A Hotel Of This Calibre.,,,,,
,4528,All Of Them  Sorry  So Many Staff It Was Impossible To Remember All The Names.,,,,,
,4533,Amy Ghazala Was Exceptional!  As Were Felicity And Verity!  Emma Was Wonderful And Patient With Our Group In The Restaurant!  And I Remember Her As Being Wonderful During Our Trip In 2010!  The Manager  Federico Aresti  Was Kind  Caring And Supportive Of All Of Us And Our Needs!  He Too Is Exceptional!,,,,,
,4534,Leanne For Her Help Carina For Her Sense Of Humour And Care Fed For His Ability To Remain Calm Under Extreme Circumstances Lads For His Flip Flop Mending Capabilities,,,,,
,4535,Reception Staff Were Very Helpful,,,,,
,4539,They Were All Very Good  Took A Day Though For Them To Warm Top For Some Reason  Perhaps The Change Over,,,,,
,4540,The Hotel Manager Was Instrumental To Our Final Few Days At The Castle!  He Was Quick To Make Amends For The Mentioned Inconveniences And Was A Pleasure To Chat With.  He Truly Is A Gem.,,,,,
,4543,The Staff Were Very Helpful When I Needed Morning Childcare For My Son (8.45Am) So That I Could Go Riding.  Very Accommodating And I Was Very Impressed.,,,,,
,4544,One Waitress In The Bistro Had A Dismissive Attitude When I Questioned The Lack Of A Choice Of Desserts And A Specials Board..,,,,,
,4547,Bulgarian Wine Sommelier,,,,,
,4557,Both Federico And Lucy Made Our Event Run Extremely Smoothly And I Cannot Thank Them Enough.,,,,,
,4564,The Guy That Delivered The Pop Corn Each Night During Great Expectations Was Very Good.,,,,,
,4567,The Manager!!  Fantastic; Warm  Friendly  Polite  So Hands On And Visible At All Times.,,,,,
,4568,Craig Who Bought Us A Drink  Mat Who Showed Us Round,,,,,
,4575,Richard From The Golf Was Very Helpfull  A Gentleman.,,,,,
,4578,Felicity Rata  She Is Just Brilliant.,,,,,
,4581,Federico Aresti: 1. Having Previously Stayed At Bovey  5 Times  We Were Surprised At The Wifi Charge  But Willing To Pay  However Hearing Our Query Mr Aresti Waived One Of The Fees As A Gesture Of Goodwill.   In Future We Are Now Aware Of The Fee And So Will The Problem Will Not Arise - However The Gesture Meant What May Have Become A Negative  However Minor  Became A Positive. 2.  I Mentioned On Arrival That We Were To Book An Afternoon Tea For My Son's Birthday For Which Mr Aresti Said He Would Like To Pay For The Champagne - It Later Turned Out That The Whole Tea Was Complementary.   We Had Already Booked In For The End Of The Xmas Term And Intend To Return Twice Next Year.  At Times Of High Pressure We Do Not Need To Add To This By Looking Elsewhere For A Holiday That Now Even Fits In With My Eldest's Transfer To Cardiff Uni - Using The Hotel Taxi Service.   The Gestures Above  Rewarding Loyalty Seem To Be Missing In Many Areas Of Life But I Can Assure You That The Financial Benefits Arising Therefrom Far Exceed The Financial Cost To The Business.  ,,,,,
,4583,Lovely Atmosphere.  The Staff Were Excellent.,,,,,
,4584,The Only 2 Members Of Staff Who Actively Made Us Feel Welcome Were Your 2 Longstanding Waitressess In The Breakfast Room.  I Think We Have Seen Them Each Visit So They Must Have Been With You 5 Years Plus.  They Are Working Really Hard And Keeping That Breakfast Service Running Reasonably Smoothly. Having Said That On Our Second Day Our Breakfast Order For 3 X Poached Eggs Was 'Lost'.  We Waited In Total 35 Minutes To Get Our Eggs!   Obviously We Can't See The Behind The Scenes Working Of The Hotel - But Since The Key Unpleasant Experiences Were: 1.  Edwardian Grill - Waiting To Place Order/Waiting For Meal 2.  Afternoon Tea - Waiting 30 Minutes For It To Arrive 3.  Breakfast - Order Lost  Waited 35 Minutes For Food To Finally Arrive We Would Guess That Some Key Problems Lie In The Kitchen - Either Not Enough Staff/Staff Not Working Efficiently Or Quick Enough,,,,,
,4585,Lindsey And Norman  Dealt With The Problems Of Collecting My Son From Exeter And Then Eventually Taunton Railway Station Very Professionally  And With Good Humour.  However  The Girls Welcoming The Guests Upon Arrival And 'Manning The Doors'  Gave Off An Air Of It Being Above Them  And You Could See Them Calculating The 'Net Worth' Of Each Guest And Adjusting Their Service As They Saw Fit.  This Had Not Been Our Experience On Our Previous Stays  When There Were No Females.  As Ever Our Highest Praise  As Always  Is Left For Fredrico.,,,,,
,4589,Our Was A Business Event. Rebecca For Her Organisation And Attention  Federico For His Constant Attention To Ensure All Went Well  And Samuel Who Was Charming When He Looked After The Bar For Our Events. Richard And His Golf Team Were Also Very Helpful,,,,,
,4590,Frederico Was Heroic As Usual. Jeremy Rata's Unrelenting Enthousiasm Was As Contagious As It Was Enjoyable.,,,,,
,4591,Everyone Was Delightful,,,,,
,4592,Staff Were Courteous And Helpful Most Of The Time. Housekeeping Did Well On Our First Night In Dealing With A List Of Requests.,,,,,
,4594,Wish We Had Taken More Notice Of Names.  The Golf Pro Was Very Helpful.  The Concierge Was Very Helpful As Were The Team On Reception.,,,,,
,4595,I Have Had To Mark This As Disagree Because I Cannot Say All The Staff  All Of The Time Were Courteous. We Arrived At 14:15 And Went To The Terrace To Find All Tables Reserved. We Were Told We Could Have A Sandwich On The Bistro Terrace - This Proved To Be Incorrect (No Bread) We Were Told We Could Only Have A Bacon Roll. We Went Back To The Lounge To Explain This And The Young Man There Kept Talking Over Me Saying What's Your Name  What's Your Name - You Haven't Booked And We're Full. Everyone Was Now Looking At Me. We Couldn't Even Have A Sandwich. We Had The Roll At The Bistro (Needed Something Small As We Weren't Booked In At The Grill Until  8:30) This Is The Only Time I Removed The Tip - I Was Very Upset. We Noticed That Between 2:30 And 5:00 Only 3 Tables Were Ever Occupied On The Terrace. At The End Of A Very Stressful Week I Almost Went Home. My Bad Mood Was Eventually Lifted By Amy Who Was Particularly Lovely - A Treasure. Chris Was Also Very Sweet.,,,,,
,4598,Leah Weber Was Very Helpful And Did An Awesome Job!  I Was In Contact With Here Several Times Before Our Arrival. She Was Great!,,,,,
,4599,Felicity At The Desk Who Effortlessly Accommodated A Late Saturday Afternoon Request For Anniversary Flowers To Be Available The Next Day. Many Thanks. Also The Golf Green-Keeping Staff Who Brought-In A Club Cover Which I Had Dropped The Previous Day.,,,,,
,4605,The Young Man Who Took Us Around Initially (Wearing The Short Trousers!) And The Different Young Man Who Saw Us To Our Car At The End (Also Wearing The Short Trousers!).  The Young Blond Woman Who Was A Waitress Who Served Us On Saturday Night At The Bistro Who Was Also Working On Sunday Morning  Who Has Been Working With You Since Last (?)November.,,,,,
,4607,Ben Who Showed Us Around Was Very Friendly  Enthusiastic   Helpful And Charming.   Leanne Who Went Through The Wedding Event Details With Me Was Also Most Helpful  Friendly And Flexible,,,,,
,4609,Ashlie  Who Continuously Looked Out For Us And Chatted In A Friendly But Unobtrusive Way. However  We Would Also Like To Comment Favourably On The Waiting Staff  Particularly A Tall Blond Young Man Who I Think Was From Slovenia.,,,,,
,4610,No,,,,,
,4613,The Tall Gentleman Who Oversees The Bar In The Oak Room Was Particularly Attentive And I Would Like To Pass On My Thanks To Him.,,,,,
,4615,The Waiter Who Served Us Dinner On Our First Evening Was Both Elusive And Suffered From Bo  So That Was Unexpected.  Gaining The Staff's Attention Was Not Not As Straightforward As One Might Expect In A Hotel Of This Standard.,,,,,
,4617,Everyone Was Very Nice,,,,,
,4618,Rachel Was Outstanding And Had It Not Been For Her I Would Have Checked Out Early .,,,,,
,4619,The Restaurant Manager,,,,,
,4622,The Overall Experience Is That Apart From Very Good Doormen The Hotel Lacks A Strong Management.,,,,,
,4624,No  All Very Personable,,,,,
,4627,I Have Stayed At Many 'Leading Hotels Of The World'  All Over The World And I Have To Say That Your Staff Made Me Feel Uncomfortable Once We Left Reception. At The Main Bar My Husband And I Sat Ignored Until I Asked For A Martini Cocktail By Shouting To The Bar Man  Who Was To Busy Encouraging An American Party To Buy More Drinks. He Reluctantly Came And Took Our Order And Made It Seem A Favour That He Was Getting My Husband A Coffee! Then Again When We Went For Pre-Dinner Drinks And Said We Were Dining In The Restraunt  We Were Given A Dis-Believing Look. We Were Told Our Table Was Ready  But We Had To Wait Some Time Before Our Starter Arrived. In Previous Leading Hotels I Have Not Had To Wait At The Table For My Starter.  I Had Ordered A Glass Of White Wine To Be Served With My Starter  But The Wine Waiter Had To Be Asked For This And As She Had Minimum English She Did Not Appear To Understand. ,,,,,
,4630,It Is A Shame When I Pointed Out My Concerns Over Room Service Food  The Blind In My Bathroom Was Not Functioning  My Door Lock Was Sticking And It Had Taken At Least 1 Hour Of The Hotel's Internet Person To Try And Get Me Wifi Connected  To A Lovely Sweet Receptionist  She Just Smiled Sweetly And Said Oh Dear! Not A Mention Of Would You Like To Speak To A Member Of The Management Team. I Never Saw Any Management At Any Time During My Stay  Only Sweet Young Things Looking Pretty. Not Very Satisfactory.,,,,,
,4632,The Man Who Helped Us With Our Luggage On The Day Of Our Stay And Also When We Left.  The Weather Was Dreadful And He Collected Our Car And Brought It Round For Us.  I Am Sorry But I Didn't Get His Name.,,,,,
,4633,Your Restaurant Manager Was Exceptionally Helpful And Professional. I Only Wish I Could Remember His Name.,,,,,
,4634,A Special Thank You To Vicky On Reception Who As Usual Is Extremely Professional. Also Special Thanks To Buna (? Spelling) & Eva At Breakfast.,,,,,
,4639,The Wedding Organiser And Our Waitress In The Bistro Were Both Extremely Helpful And Friendly.,,,,,
,4641,I Didn't Take Note Of Her Name  But The Young Lady Who Arranged To Have My Grandaughter And Daughter Moved To A Room Together  After Staff Had Already Made Up A Spare Bed For My Grandaughter In Our Room. Sorry  I Wish I Had Made A Note Of Her Name. Blonde With Longish Hair?,,,,,
,4644,All Staff Were Extremely Friendly  Efficient And Courteous,,,,,
,4648,Frederico Was Great,,,,,
,4652,Federico Was Helpful In Resolving Our Complaint About The Additional Charges For Our Daughters Meals.,,,,,
,4653,We Very Much Enjoyed Meeting And Listening To The Falconer.,,,,,
,4654,A Young Lady In The Bistro  Unfortunately She Told Us She Was Leaving This Week! Also Adam Was Helpful When We Arrived  Sorting Luggage Etc.,,,,,
,4655,The Waiter In The Bistro,,,,,
,4659,There Was No 'One' Person - Would Mention That All Of The 'Team' Were Quite Exceptional In Their Politeness And Professionalism - In Fact This Was Apparent Of All The Staff  And On All Levels - Quite Unique!,,,,,

,4688,The Entire Staff Was Fantastic.,,,,,
,4692,I Strongly Agree With Some Of The Members -John  I Thought Was Very Good + Bar Staff And House Keeping. The Waitresses Were Incredibly Slow I Asked Three Times For Slices Of Lemon For My Tea By The Time I Received Them My Tea Was Cold Ruined My Pleasure Of A Cream Tea.The Same At Breakfast My Fork Was Dirty  Again Asked Three Times To Change It.One Waitress Was Standing Doing Nothing .,,,,,
,4695,Don't Remember All The Names  But Your 'Doormen' Were All Excellent And Helpful At Arrival And Parking Etc.  Also Alex Who Waited Table Outdoors For Us,,,,,

,4698,Welsh Man Who Greeted Us And Sommelier In Edwardian Restaurant,,,,,
,4700,The Two Young Ladies In The Bar.  Despite Not Having Lager On Tap They Were Prepared To Go To The Bistro To Get It And Also Helped With A Surprise Present And Champagne Which My Husband Organised For Our Ruby Wedding Celebration.,,,,,
,4705,No They Were All Excellent - A Credit To You.,,,,,
,4711,All Staff (Including The Owl) Were First Class. We Admired Frederico For Being There 'At The Sharp End' Rather Than Taking The Usual Manger Stance Of Hiding Behind A Desk.,,,,,
,4712,The Hotel Manager And The Housekeeping Manager Prodided Excellent And Instant Service To Solve 2 Issues. Unfortunately These Issues Were Reported To Front Desk Staff Who Did Nothing About Them,,,,,
,4713,Some Members Of Staff Were Extremely Helpful.,,,,,
,4714,The Staff Were All Excellent. The Barman In The Main Bar Was Engaging And Knowledgeable,,,,,
,4716,Your 'Front Door' Team Were Excellent In Both Their Efficiency - Making Light Of Our Arrival With Cases And Dog  Was Very Much Appreciated; Their Knowledge Of Walks In And Around The Grounds Was First Class And Particularly Appreciated As We Had Our Dog With Us  All Rounded Off By Their 'Country Attire' Appearance. Excellent !!,,,,,
,4719,The Staff Are Extremely Good On Check-In  When They Are Dealing With Your Query But At Times Some Staff Avoided 'Eye Contact'.  This Was Particularly Noticable At Breakfast.,,,,,
,4720,I Would Compliment A Number Of Staff  However For Me Federico Was Always There With The Guests To Ensure They Had A Great Experience  Thank You,,,,,
,4724,The Wine Waiter Was Short Sighted And Nervous. The Breakfast Staff (Esp The Males) Were Not Professional.,,,,,
,4727,There Was A Lady On Reception Who Managed To Accommodate Us For Afternoon Tea When It Was Fully Booked... We Had Not Realised A Reservation Was Needed.  Apparently There Was A Wedding On.  She Made No Fuss And Organised It Quietly And Efficiently... Wish I Could Remember Her Name.,,,,,
,4728,We Were Very Impressed With Frederico Aresti  Hotel Manager. He Seemed Ever Present And Ever Attentive. From Greeting Us By Name When We Arrived Through Numerous Interactions Throughout Our Stay. Quite Simply The Best Hotel Manager We Have Ever Met (And We've Been In Many Luxury Hotels Around The World),,,,,
,4729,The Bus Boy Helping Us With Our Bags From The Car Park Was Very Friendly & Helpful But Unfortunately I Do Not Remember His Name  I Thought It Was Impressive He Remember Us The Next Day And Remembered Where We Were Going.,,,,,

,4739,The Edwardian Restaurant Manageress At Breakfast Was Delightful And Very Kind And Helpful To My Husband Who Is Recovering From A Operation Which Has Left Him Only Half A Stomach So Cannot Eat Normal Helpings Any More.,,,,,
,4740,No.  Generally I Thought The Service Was Poor.  We Seemed To Have Wait A Long Time For Anything We Ordered.  I Felt The Fact That A Twelve And A Half Percent Service Charge Was Automatically Added To One's Bill Was Known By The Staff And Consequently Reflected In The Relatively Poor Service Offered.,,,,,
,4747,No,,,,,
,4748,The Friendly Bar Man  Sorry Forgotten His Name!,,,,,
,4750,Too High A Proportion Of The Staff Spoke No English At All,,,,,

,4763,I Am Sorry We Did Not Ask For Names  But All Members Of Staff Were Extremely Courteous Knowledgable And First Class Service.,,,,,
,4765,Everyone Was Very Attentive.,,,,,
,4768,The Guy That Immediately Came Up To Us Upon Arrival And Did Park My Vehicle. Possibly Arriving With A Big Van Did Not Help My 'Image'. Possibly Coming In My 1929 Bentley Might Have Made A Difference !!,,,,,
,4769,Julie. Always Pleasant And Smiling. Acknowledged Us Whenever We Passed As If She Knew Us.,,,,,
,4774,Yes  The Guy Who Taught Us Archery And Shooting Air Rifles Was Excellent. Clearly Explained  Helpful  Polite And Interesting Conversationalist. Sorry Can't Recall His Name But We Did The Activity On 5Th June,,,,,

,4783,We Enjoyed The Falconry Display  Which We Attended Twice.  The Birds And Their Handler Were Fun And Informative.  We Were Able To See All Of The Birds On The First Day.  On The Second Day It Rained  So We Were Only Able To See A Few Of The Birds.,,,,,
,4787,Special Effort Made To Recognise Birthday Celebrations Within The Family Group And Accommodate Afternoon Tea Was Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,4788,Falconer Was A Real Treat!,,,,,
,4790,Polly And Everyone Else Mike For The Fishing Trip And Of Course The Owl And Falconry Gentleman,,,,,
,4793,The (Male) Scottish Duty Manager Was Excellent,,,,,
,4795,Only The Chap At The Parking Upon Our Arrival.,,,,,
,4799,The Manager Was Excellent But Maybe Attention Should Be Paid To When Peter De Savary Had It  As Things Seemed To Be Alot Better And Also Maybe Michel Roux Should Pay Another Visit Staff Training Is In Need,,,,,
,4801,The General Manager  Federico Aresti  Was Extremely Professional And Gracious Throughout Our Stay. He Was On Top Of Every Situation And Made Our Stay Most Enjoyable.,,,,,

,4889,All,,,,,
,4890,Only One Member Was Disappointing.  When We Had A Drink In The Bar The Gentleman Concerned Criticised The Young Frenchbarman About How He Had Made Our Cocktails.  He Should Not Have Done This In Front Of Us.  And There Was Nothing Wrong With The Cocktails.  All The Other Staff Were Excellent And I Could Not Single One Out,,,,,
,4893,Your Staff Are World Class. They Were All Fantastic.,,,,,
,4894,David Who Hosted Our Wine Tasting Experience - He Was Very Friendly And Knowledgeable And Being A Complete Novice He Took The Time To Explain Everything Without Making Me Feel Silly.

,4954,Some Members Of Staff Were Very Friendly And Made Us Feel Very Welcome  However  Others Were Quite Abrupt And Not What We Would Expect From A Five Star Establishment.  ,,,,,
,4955,It Is Unusual For Me To Call Out A Specific Team Member By Being Dissatisfied But I Thought The Woman On Recpetion Who Greeted Us ( At Around 7Pm On Thursday 28Th November) Was Cold And Offhand. She Did Not Participate In Conversation When Taking Us Up To Our Room   And Was Only Interested In Pointing Out Access Points. Not A Great Welcome. Bar Staff Were Warm And Friendly,,,,,
,4962,Federico Of Course  Always Most Generous But All The Staff Are Always Most Courteous  Helpful And Obliging.,,,,,

,5057,Marta Was Wonderful And Tried So Hard To Make Me My Bloody Bull Cocktail. Please Thank Her For Me.  Emma Was Also Very Lovely To Us. She Is A Real Credit To The Hotel And Became Part Of The Family During Our Week. We Hope The Hotel Recognises Her Loyalty And Proficiency  And We Hope Her Car Gets Back On The Road.   Slightly Referencing Back To The Extreme Conditions We All Traveled Through To Get To The Hotel  And For Guests The Lack Of Good Directions On Your Website And The Lack Of Signage Nearby  It Also Occurred To Us That Perhaps The Hotel Could Have Looked After The Transport Needs Of Its Staff Over Those Stormy Evenings. Emma Should Not Have Needed To Lose Her Car In Order To Work At The Hotel; That Seems A Lopsided Contract. ,,,,,
,5060,The Roumanian Maitre'd Was Excellent.,,,,,
,5063,Yes All,,,,,
,5067,The Gentelman Who Took Us For Archery And Shooting In The Worst Weather Possible.  He Kept Smiling And Assisted With Our Highly Competeitive Family - And Particuarly Helped Our 6 Year Old And To Do Far More Than We Thought He Would Be Able To.,,,,,

,5089,Federico Is A Versatile All Round Hands On Manager  Very Impressed With His Customer Service And Recognition Of Knowing Returning Customers.  He's Always Around And Seems To Be Very Aware Of The Workings Of His Staff.,,,,,
,5090,Everyone Was Pleasant  Welcoming And Offered To Help If We Needed It.,,,,,
,5094,Frederico And The Manageress Were Very Impressive. Derek And The "Outside" Team Were Also Very Friendly And Always In Good Humour. Finally  The Lovely Lady On Duty In The Ladies Cloakroom And The Young Man Who Had To Constantly Clean Up After The Young Girl. We Felt So Sorry For Them But They Were Amazingly Good About It And So Nice. All The Staff Are Wonderful.,,,,,
,5095,There Was A Young Polish Waitress Serving In The Oak Bar Who I Believe Is Married To The Bar Manager  She Is Delightful And Caring And A Real Asset To Your Hotel. (I Do Not Know Her Name But I Believe They Both Live At Exeter.),,,,,

The Reception Staff Are Lovely - Pleasant And Happy To Help At All Times And With All Questions. The Lady In Front Of The Reception (Blonde Hair  Can't Remember Her Name) Is A Real Asset To The Hotel - Friendly  Welcoming  Doesn't Miss A Trick. Went Out For A Trek With Derek (I Think) Who Was Friendly  Fun And Knowledgeable And Made The Walk Interesting And Memorable.,,,,,
,5106,Frederico  The Manager  Was So Attentive To Everyone At All Times. The Gentleman Who Looked After Our Room  Peter B.  Was Extremely Helpful. Alex Who Did The Sloe Gin And Cider Making Was Great Fun.  ,,,,,

,5126,I've Already 'Acknowledged' The Staff Member Who Was Grudging Over The Afternoon Tea - I Was Very Polite In Asking For It To Be Moved To The Oak Bar  Unlike The Two Ladies We Heard Making All Sorts Of Fuss Over Something Similar.  Otherwise  I Felt That All Staff At The Front Desk Were Polite  Helpful And Friendly  Though I Wasn't Particularly Happy At Having To Supply My Travelzoo Voucher On 3 Separate Occasions - Booking  Check-In And Check-Out.  Generally Speaking  Everyone Provided Good Service Though  As I Said  The Fact That I'm Specifically Paying A Service Charge For Pretty Much Everything Detracts A Little - It Feels Like It's Just Because I'm Paying For It And Not Because They Want To Go Above And Beyond. Perhaps That's Naiive But It Got To A Point Where We Felt Reluctant To Ask For Anything Because We Presumed There Would Be A Charge Attached.,,,,,
,5133,All Staff Lovely ,,,,,
,5134,I Would Like To Thanks To Alex And Garret  Both Take Us For The Cider Tasting  Good People And They Care About Their Knowledge. I Would Like To Thanks To The Rumanian Guy At The Edwardian  Very Polite And Always Trying To Bring Joy To Our Table  I Don't Know His Name  But Thank You. Thanks To Everyone  Traveling With Children Is Not Really Easy  A Lot To Plan And We Forgot Many Things  Everyone Was Able To Help Us And To Care About Us. From My Husband And I  Thanks To The Black Guy In The Bar  Drinks Were Amazing  We Relax A Lot...Lol... I Don't Know His Name  But Thank You Very Much. We Appreciated.,,,,,

,5168,It Was A Shame That The Reception Team Didn't Seem To Connect Very Well With Other Areas Of The Hotel Staff. We Asked Three Times For Rubbish To Be Collected And Warned Them That We Had Had To Leave Bags Outside But No One Collected. Through Shear Frustration We Called Housekeeping And Immediately The Bags Were Removed. Not Sure Why Our Requests Weren't Been Passed On...............?  ,,,,,

,5219,No,,,,,
,5224,Absolutely Everyone Was Professional And Friendly - A Real Credit To You. And So Good To See Younger Staff Members Looking Smart And With Pride In Their Appearance - And I Say This Not As An Ageist Comment  But As Owner/Director Of A Service Business Myself  With Experience Of Some Newer Staff Members...,,,,,
,5225,I Am Afraid I Do Not Know Their Names But The Lady Greeter In The Bar And The Gentleman  Who Seems To Be The Senior Waiter At Breakfast,,,,,
,5227,The Manager Gave Us A Tour And He Was Very Friendly As Well As Professional. All If The Staff Were Very Knowledgable Within Their Area And Made Us Feel Very Welcome And That Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. ,,,,,

,5259,I Would Like To Mention Gareth That Made Sure We Enjoy Our Activity And Also Took Some Time To Show Us One Of Your  Lodges.,,,,,
,5266,You Cannot Pick One Out As They Were All Courteous And Helpful.,,,,,
,5267,The 2 Ladies On Reception Upon Arrival Were Very Helpful Indeed As Was Donna From Reservations.,,,,,
,5269,All Good,,,,,
,5279,As Mentioned,,,,,
,5280,Paul .. Think He Was A Trainee Manager .. Excellent  Made Us Feel Very Welcome And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble,,,,,
,5281,Ashley And Federico Were Most Helpful.
Some Of My Guests Were A Bit High Maintenance And For That I Apologise  But Both Of You Helped Us All Have A Great Time.,,,,,
,5282,Ashley... Nice Women!,,,,,
,5283,Lauren On Archery Was Excellent And Even Told Us About Your Wedding Packages! ,,,,,
,5286,The Chap That Lights The Fires - He Took The Time To Talk Rather Then Just Doing His Job
Also The Housekeeping Member That Handed My Necklace In That Had Been Left On The Table In The Main Hall.  (By My Husband!)This Item Is Very Important As It Was Given To Me By Friends While Having Cancer Treatement.  I Still Need To Collect Though!,,,,,
,5287,Apart From Experience In Lounge Bar,,,,,
,5290,All Staff Were Great.,,,,,
,5295,Charlotte And Reception Staff,,,,,
,5296,The General Manager Was Very Welcoming And Friendly   And Our Waiter Was Excellent ,,,,,
,5297,Ashley Was Especially Helpfully  Attentive & Made Us Feel Very Much At Home  Nothing Was To Much Trouble For Her - Thank You Ashley.,,,,,
,5298,Matt Was Outstanding In The Cocktail Making,,,,,
,5301,Not Sure Of Name : Maybe The Manager  Pos Italian Very Chatty And Welcoming  Went The Extra Mile ; Very Nice And Professional Man Who Parked Vehicles And Did Fires ; All The Waiting Staff,,,,,
,5303,We Were Unable To Get The Names Of All Of The Staff  And It Would Be Unfair Of Us To Single Out Any One Simply Because We Remembered Their Name.  What Made It So Pleasant Was That It Was The Combination Of All Of The Staff Having A Professional  Yet Personal  Attention To Our Needs - On A Number Of Occasions They Even Anticipated Our Needs.,,,,,
,5304,The General Manager. He Knew My Wife Was Leaving For A Job Abroad Through A Brief Comment I Made On The Phone Once. 
That Made A Difference. ,,,,,
,5305,All The Staff  Without Exception  Were Very Helpful And Pleasant.,,,,,
,5306,They Were All Fantastic !,,,,,
,5316,There Was A Young French Lad Who Was The Bar Man And A Young Lady Who Served On Our Table For The Evening Meal Were A Credit To The Hotel  They Were Very Welcoming And Answered All Of The Questions We Had About The Hotel  They Went The Extra Mile.,,,,,
,5318,The Lady On The Front Desk For Looking After Our Dog - But We Do T Know Her Name!  Sorry!  That Was Well Above The Expected Level Of Service - The Lady Even Took Our Dog For A Walk!  Wow!,,,,,
,5319,Derek Was Simply Great - An Initial Greeting And Big Smile And Settled Us In F Quickly. And Sophie And Sammy In Reception. Nothing Was Too Much Trouble ,,,,,
,5320,An Excellent Team Which Have Been Well Trained And Are A Real Credit To The Hotel,,,,,
,5322,Some Male Waiters Were Very Kind ,,,,,
,5323,Manager (With Sideburns - Sorry I Don't Know How Else To Describe Him!)  In Edwardian Restaurant And Bar -- Felt Like He Knew What Was Going And Was Very Personable And Professional
,,,,,
,5324,Some Outstanding Individuals.  ,,,,,
,5325,Felicity On Reception And Bob In The Dining Room. But Everyone Made Us Feel At Home And Made Our Celebration Even More Special. ,,,,,
,5327,The Ranger On Our Arrival And Who Was Also On Duty On The Morning Of Sunday 2Nd Feb - Very Pleasant - I Left Something In My Car That Had Been Parked Right At The End Of The Rear Mews Towards The Back Gate. I Was Just Closing The Door To My Car When He Drove Past In The Landrover Back Towards The House - Again A Small Thing - He Stopped Asked If All Was Well And Offered My A Lift Back - Would Have Been Very Easy For Him To Have Driven Passed.  ,,,,,
,5328,Derek - The "Ferret" Man. Kind  Helpful  Knowledgeable And Professional. Keen Interest In Bovey And Dartmoor. Great Knowledgeable Person To Have On The Estate. 
Frederico - Excellent Professional Manager. Great Attitude  Always Visible And Ready To Help. Really Very Impressed  We Felt That It Was Important To Him Personally That We Had A First Class Stay At Bovey. And Throughout Our Weeks Stay He Kept Making Sure We Were Happy And Well Looked After. 
Ashley - Very Welcoming Nature  Listens To Her Guests And Always Ready To Help. Excellent Personable Manner.
,,,,,
,5329,All Of Them Were Very Polite And Professional.,,,,,
,5333,The Staff Who Greet You When You Arrive And Deal With The Luggage  They Have To Deal With Such Awful Weather Conditions And Give A Great Welcome Regardless. ,,,,,
,5334,Excellent Service & Attentive But Not Overpowering ,,,,,
,5335,Derrick He Made Us Feel Very Welcome An Looked After Us With Just The Right Amount Of Assistance. ,,,,,
,5336,Federico Was Everywhere  Seemed Like A Host In His Home,,,,,
,5337,As I Said Before Maria. B Is A Credit To Your Team  Always Smiling & Making Sure We Were Ok. Lovely Lady! ,,,,,
,5338,Yes  All Of Them But I Do Not Know Their Names! Friendly And Helpful Throughout.,,,,,
,5339,All Staff Were Very Good And Attentive But In Particular  Samuel Really Looked After Us.,,,,,
,5340,Question 20 Is With The Exception Of The Maintenance Man... While I Am Sure He Did Not Mean To Be Rude And Just Wanted To Resolve The Issue  He Does Ned To Be Mindful That People Are Paying A Vast Amount Of Money For The Pleasure Of Being In The Hotel.  Federico Was Very Apologetic When We Checked Out And He Clearly Is The Driving Force Behind Such An Amazing Hotel With Amazing Staff.,,,,,
,5342,The Chap Who Took Us To The Cider And Slow Gin Making On The Saturday Was Attentive And Patient. He Deserves Our Thanks.

The Chap Who Brings The Birds Of Prey Is Clearly Very Bitter About The Recent Break Up Of His Marriage  Referring To It On Every Sentence. Not Appropriate Really.,,,,,
,5344,Fredrico Aresti  The Manager Was Very Accommodating And Ever Present. He Made Our Stay Very Enjoyable And I Would Like To Acknowledge Him For His Efforts.,,,,,
,5350,Yes  Frederico Seemed To Very Everywhere  Is Work Rate Was Amazing  To The Extent That I Was Convinced That There Must Have Been 5 Of Him!   Service Wise  Absolutely 'On The Money'.,,,,,
,5351,Matt  The Bar Manager Was Superb,,,,,
,5352,No,,,,,
,5353,All Of The Staff Were Particularly Attentive & Polite From The Young Valet Who Greeted Us On Arrival & Parked Our Car To The Reception & Waiting Staff Who Served Our Needs With Meticulous Care.,,,,,
,5355,All The Staff That We Came Into Contact With Were All Very Helpful And Pleasant.  They Are A Credit To Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,5356,No  They Were All Perfectly Helpful.,,,,,
,5357,The Young Lady Who Was On Duty In The Bar Until Late On 14/2 Was Particularly Hospitable (Not That The Others Weren't!)  And Spoke To The Manager About Our Missed Dinner.  This Wasn't Anything We Had Asked For So It Was A Pleasant Surprise To Be Offered A Complementary Lunch The Following Day.  Just A Shame We Didn't Have Time To Enjoy It.  ,,,,,
,5358,They Were All Very Good,,,,,
,5361,Lucy Was Just Outstanding As Always And Made  Us Feel Really Welcome. 
The Hotel Manager Federico Was Again Impeccable. ,,,,,
,5363,They Were All Good,,,,,
,5365,No,,,,,
,5366,Manner Of Waiter Taking Drinks Order In Lounge Before Dinner Was A Little Impatient. Waiters At Dinner Were Excellent,,,,,
,5372,Ella For Saving Us In The Stormy Weather And Organising Alternative Transport And Federico For His Continuous Check On Our Well Being And Care Of Us - Much Thanks! ,,,,,
,5373,They Were All Nice. I Talked To A Man From Poland In The Bar For Some Time. Very Nice Fellow.,,,,,
,5374,Danielle Gave An Excellent Sundari Treatment,,,,,
,5376,We Did Not Really Take Note Of Any Names But Everyone Was Very Helpful And Friendly   Brilliant,,,,,
,5377,Everyone Was Wonderful And Very Friendly ,,,,,
,5378,My Partner And I Met A Lady Who Went By The Name Of Lauren When We First Arrived At The Hotel. She Offered A Tour Of The Hotel And Booked My Partner And I For Our Spa Treatments Without Delay. She Was Very Helpful  Informative  Hospitable And Is Perhaps The Staff Member Who Left The Biggest Impression (Positive!) With Us.,,,,,
,5379,Breakfast Was Very Slow Service,,,,,
,5382,Sorry Didn't Make A Note Of The Names But All Was Very Good,,,,,
,5383,None Other Than As Mentioned Above.,,,,,
,5385,Maitre De In Restaurant Was Verygood,,,,,
,5387,The Grill Waitress That New Every Cheese On The Board  She Was Delightful!,,,,,
,5388,All The Members Of Staff Were Friendly Attentive And Polite At All Times. Most Impressive.,,,,,
,5389,The Manager And Room Manager,,,,,
,5392,All Very Good,,,,,
,5393,Thanks To Matt Who Gave Us The Cocktail Demo Was Outstanding,,,,,
,5396,We Were Basically Ignored By The Bar Man In The Oak Bar And Felt Like An Inconvenience  I Felt The Majority Of The Staff Are A Little Robotic And There Is No Real Warmth Or Sincerity. The Man In The Evening Who Set The Fire Going Was Friendly And Chatty.,,,,,
,5402,The Greeter On Arrival Was Most Helpful.,,,,,
,5404,Spa Manager.  The Chaps Greeters In The Reception Were Excellent.  Waiters In Restaurant (Edwardian) Excellent.  Service In Piano Bar Very Good.,,,,,
,5408,All Very Positive Especially The Doormen And The Service In The Lodges When We Phoned Up For Silly Things Like Maple Syrup And Cooking Oil Etc.   Overnight Reception Staff Were Not As Skilled As The Rest Of The Team.,,,,,
,5413,Lauren Who Showed Us To Our Rooms  Met Us Later In The Bar And Occasionally In The Corridors - Always Remembered Our Names And Asked How We Were Enjoying Our Stay. She Was Very Informative About The Hotel And Its History And About Local Points Of Interest Etc.   Also The ""Doormen" Who Met Our Car On Arrival And Offered Assistance With Luggageand Car Parking  Were Always Attentive In The Lobby Area And On Our Departure.  Excellent First And Last Impressions.,,,,,
,5416,The Manager Was Extremely Friendly And Enjoyable To Converse With. ,,,,,
,5417,Felicity On Reception  Derrick Re Car Parking  And Kim & Charlie In The Spa Plus Federico For Being Such An Excellent Host(As Usual).,,,,,
,5420,Yes  Waitress In Edwardian (Possibly From Romania) Was Charming. Just A Pity Your Waiter Spoilt My Evening In The Edwardian. Waiter During Afternoon Tea Was Also Very Accommodating.  Person At Door On Arrival Was Charming.,,,,,
,5421,Lauren Again. ,,,,,
,5430,A Great Team So Difficult To Single Out Any One Person  The Girl From The Spa (Sorry Can't Remember Her Name) Was Lovely And The Chap Who Tried To Fix The Blind Couldn't Have Tried Harder To Help. Frederico Was Wonderful As Always As Were Reception. ,,,,,
,5431,The Valet Who Met Us On Arrival Was Very Friendly And Helpful And Immediately Made Us Feel At Home.,,,,,
,5433,It Was A Young Man. I Think His Name Was Gareth  But I May Be Wrong....On Saturday  February 15Th He Took Us To See The Chickens And The Ferrets. He Was Very Nice  Polite And Friendly  Very Knowlegible And The Whole Experience Added An Extra Touch To Our Stay. 
Also  We Left A Mobile Harger In Our Room Once We Checked Out. When I Called Back And Spoke With House Keeping  They Were Very Friendly  Located And Charger And Send It Back Straight Away. We've Received It With A Nice Packet Of Fudge  Which Was Very Sweet - A Very Nice Touch.,,,,,

,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,
,4,My Parents Paid The Final Bill And They Found That They Were Charged Â£370+ In Service Charges And Vat.  Service Charges You Expect Because Most Places Charge Those.    But There Was Vat Added To The Room Rate When It Was Understood That The Room Was Â£379 (Or Something Like That).  They Only Realised This When They Arrived Back Home.  If You Would Like To Contact Them Regarding This Please Contact Them.  They Stayed In Room 2.,,,,,
,7,No  We've Had A Truly Wonderful Stay - Thank You All.,,,,,
,9,We Had An Amazing Experience.,,,,,
,10,It's Not Often That It Happens But No  Excellent Stay.,,,,,
,11,Always Love My Stay At Bovey  I Just Wish I Was Able To Come Up More Often!,,,,,
,12,Improve Service As Mentioned Before.,,,,,
,13,The Heating In Our Room Did Not Work.  It Did Not Come On With The Timer  As We Were Informed.  The Small Convector Heater Helped A Lot  But In Colder Weather  It Would Be Insufficient.,,,,,
,14,Cleaner Lodge.  Better Quality Pillows And Duvet.  Hollowfill Needs To Replaced Very Frequently To Be A Good Alternative To Down.,,,,,
,17,Sort The Weather Out!,,,,,
,19,Breakfast Service Was A Little Slow,,,,,
,21,No It Was Great,,,,,
,22,Only Complaint Was The Weather But After All It Is Dartmoor In January!,,,,,
,24,We Really Felt Like At Home. It Was Great To Stay In Your Hotel.,,,,,
,27,We Did Arrive A Couple Of Hours Early After An Extremely Long  Hot And Tiring Drive From Kent.  It Was Not Easy To Get Access To Our Lodge Even Though It Had Been Cleaned And Was Ready.  3 Times We Had To Go To Reception To Ask If We Could Have Our Key Yet.  We Had Unloaded All Our Luggage Down The Steep Steps Ourselves And Were Just Waiting To Go In.  We Just Wanted To Get Settled In And Relax And Begin Our Holiday  The Day We Arrived Was My Birthday But It Was Quite Stressful Because We Couldn't Get Access To The Lodge.  I Do Think Your Staff Could Have Been A Bit More Helpful In Getting Us In Earlier  We Even Offered To Pay For The Extra Hours.,,,,,
,31,Have A Brochure To Include Self Catering Apartments,,,,,
,33,No - It Was Perfect!,,,,,
,36,Room View And Dining Options Could Be Improved Upon.,,,,,
,40,Several Activities Were Not Available Due To Time Of Year Or Weather.  It Would Have Been Nice To Know This In Advance.,,,,,
,41,The Only Slight Problem I Had Overall Was That My Car Was Parked Under A Tree And After 4 Days It Was Covered In Tree Sap And Leaves. It Is Not A Huge Problem But Patrons With Expensive Cars May Become Upset At This.,,,,,
,45,Earlier Check In For Guests Staying Only 1 Night. Email Guests The Day Before Their Stay To Confirm Their Booking And Welcome Them To Their Stay.,,,,,
,47,Made Sure The Bbq Gas Worked!,,,,,
,48,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Ourselves And Would Like To Return - Possibly With The Children Next Time.,,,,,
,50,As Previously Stated: Would Have Liked More Treatment Availability And Fresh Milk,,,,,
,51,Better Service In The Cathedral Room At Lunchtime Staff Seem Obsessed With Preparing Tables For Tea At 1.30 Pm. When We Were Served It Was Only After Chasing Staff In The Room Who Never Approached Voluntarily And Then Failed To Deliver One White Sandwich And One Brown - Albeit That They Were Delicious,,,,,
,52,Quality Of The Food Is Poor In Comparison To Everything Else.,,,,,
,58,The Bathroom In Room 14 Could Do With A Little Updating And A Little Tlc.,,,,,
,61,Even The Weather Was Perfect!,,,,,
,63,No All Very Good,,,,,
,64,I Think The Menu Could Include A Lighter Option In The Evening - Certainly A Low Cal Pudding Or Fruit- For Those Watching Their Weight!,,,,,
,66,No,,,,,
,69,Arrived At 8Pm In Oak Room For Our 8.15Pm Table On Sat Night - But Did Not Get To Table Till 9.15 - Didn't Matter To Us But Was Quite Slow Luggage Didn't All Make It To Me - Second Lot (Golf Hold All And Rucksack) Were Under A Coat Behind Reception And Not Delivered To Our Room,,,,,
,70,Just Point On Pre-Book Transfer And Staff Expecting Us. Lodge Maintenance Noise Was Very Frustrating And Instrusive To Our Stay. Disappointing That We Were Not Advise Of Work Startingor Duration.,,,,,
,73,We Loved Our Stay At Bovey Castle And Would Definitely Return But  If I Am Being Honest  We Stay At A Lot Of 5 Star Hotels And Eat At A Lot Of Michelin Starred Restaurants And Really It Is The Food And Food Service Element That Lets The Hotel Down So I Have Marked Our Experience As Fell Below Expectations....,,,,,
,74,Yes Could Not Hear The Wedding Service. Was Very Hot Outside And Would Of Been Nice To Have Refreshments,,,,,
,75,The Various Service Charges That Appear On The Bill Make The Final Payment More Than You'd Expect And Leaves A Bad Feeling - Shame - Lots Of People Felt The Same.  I Haven't Come Across This In Any Other Uk Hotel.  Slightly Puts You Off Returning.  We Had A Very Good Deal But If I Was Paying Full Whack  I'd Be Feeling Rather Ripped Off With Cost Of Drinks  Breakfast Extra  Service Charges Etc.  If Rates/Extras Were Cheaper We'd All Be Back In A Jiffy.  Would Be Interested To Know What Your Occupancy Levels Are Like In The Current Climate (Apparently Only 2 Rooms Were Occupied The Night Before Our Arrival).  By The Way Don't Forget To Change The Info Pack In The Room Which Says On A Couple Of Pages That You Have To Pay For Wifi,,,,,
,77,My Husband And I Said Our Ny's Eve There Was Absolutely Wonderful And We All Had A Fantastic Time And So Did Our Friends.  We Think You Should Do A 'Count Down' For The New Year And Possible Big Ben Chimes Or Something As Midnight Came And Went Without Us Knowing But Then The Fireworks Were Amazing And Absolutely Wonderful - So A Bit More Winding Up To Midnight Would Be Perfect For Us.,,,,,
,87,Nothing Obvious -- If You Want Me To Quibble I'd Point Out That The Toilet Paper Dispenser In The Bathroom Was Starting To Come Out Of The Wall  But It Hardly Affected Our Stay.,,,,,
,88,A Bit Disappointed At Being Asked To Pay For Barbecue Gas Each Day And Difficult To Predict 24 Hours Notice. It Was A Gorgeous Setting For Eating On Balcony And A Lovely Barbecue In Place Which We Would Have Liked To Use More. Staff Were Very Helpful And Sorted Out At Less Notice But Only Thing That Stopped Our Stay Being Perfect.,,,,,
,89,Please Please Get A  Catering Manager / Chief Who Can Understand What People Want And One Who Understands This Is Not A Top London Venue . Drop The Pretension . Get The ' Bistro ' Sorted . Make The Main Dinning Room Into Something Much Nicer.   Breakfast Was Very Good In Terms Of Quality Of Food But Very Inconsistent. Why Have Cooked Breakfast On The Menu And As A Self Service Option. One Day One Egg Etc   Next Day A Full Plate. Very Confusing. The Main Dinning Room Is Utterly Soulless. The Evening Food Is So Overpriced As To Be Beyond Belief In Such A Terrible Dinning Room.,,,,,
,92,Let Us Know At The Start That Spaces In The Downstairs Rooms Are Booked At 3Pm For Cream Tea - And Offer Alternatives (Good And Bad Weather Options).,,,,,
,93,Maps Of The Hotel And Grounds Would Be An Excellent Idea.  Also A Plan Of The Golf Course.  We Didn't Find The Practice Area.,,,,,
,96,Prior Contact To Check If Spa Treatments Were Required,,,,,
,100,Food Fell Below Bovey Castle Standard.,,,,,
,103,Wifi  Drink With Dinner  Wellington Boots (You Only Had Sizes 4 Or 12) And We Were Told Thats Because People Take Them With Them.  That Didn't Help Us When We Wanted To Go On One Of Your Walks.,,,,,
,107,Nothing To Mention.,,,,,
,108,I Think The Pianist Should Do A Second Session After Dinner  Around 9.30Pm To 11Pm This Would Encourage More People To Use The Bar. After Dinner On Saturday It Was Deserted. We Didnâ€™T Use The Bistro Because It Was Virtually Empty  There Could Be A Discount Offer Made To Guests So That They Make Use Of The Bistro  Maybe Early Evening 7-9Pm Discount Or Free Drink Offer.,,,,,
,111,Only Fell Below Because Of The Dinner Experience & Cost Of Extras Was High.Do Not Particularly Like Having An Automatic Service Charge.Rooms  Public Areas & Grounds Were Great.,,,,,
,116,Locker System In Swimming Pool Could Be Better Our Steak Order Was Mixed Up And Also One Steak Wasn't Cooked As Asked For,,,,,
,119,I Had To Wait About 15Mins For Breakfast  And Was Told It Would Be A Couple Of Minutes !  Let Your Staff Make Decisions On Tables Rather Than Waiting On A Manager . Which Added To The Wait,,,,,
,120,I No Our Stay Was A Last Minute Booking  I Felt A Much Better Room Could Have Been Allocated For Two Hundred And Fifty Pounds A Night,,,,,
,121,Service In The Restaurants,,,,,
,123,Air Conditioning Would Have Helped As We Did Not Sleep On Both Nights We Stayed There. Left Feeling More Tired Than When We Arrived.,,,,,
,129,Service Charge Was Not Discretionary....! Do You Owe Us 12.5% Off Final Account..? I Was Not Made Aware Of Any Charges When Agreeing Cost For My Trip Or Advised When I Booked In..? Please Advise.,,,,,
,130,Making Sure Items Were All There In Lodge Kitchen - Several Essential Items Were Missing. Ie Cork Screw And Frying Pan,,,,,
,131,My Finding Was Rather Like A School Report; The Potential Is There But More Attention To Detail Is Needed If The Heights To Which Bovey Castle Aspires Are To Be Reached.,,,,,
,134,Supply Magazines As Before .  See Previous Reply,,,,,
,139,Increase The Fees By 5 Percent Rather Than Charge The Discretionary Fee. I Did Not Feel Comfortable Agreeing To The Discretioary Charge Prior To Receiving The Staff Services.,,,,,
,142,Only As Above.,,,,,
,148,Enable On Demand Room Service In The Lodges Rather Than The Current Timing Of Requiring 24 Hours Notice. Unfortunately Room Service Tends To Be On A Whim So Pre-Ordering Isn't Much Help For That. It Also Means That The Establishment Loses Out On F&B Revenue.,,,,,
,149,None,,,,,
,152,Nothing All Was Great,,,,,
,153,Nothing At All  We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay,,,,,
,157,At Breakfast Take The Butter Out Of The Fridge And Let It Warm Up!!,,,,,
,160,Definitely Better Waiting Staff Throughout Please.  Generally Speaking It Comes From The Top  So Is Your Management Happy.  The Swimming Pool Changing Rooms Were An Enormous Disappointment  Very Much Worse Than My Old School Changing Rooms.  Shabby  Poor Decor  No Locker Keys To Hand  No Attendant Close By.  The Golf Pro Shop Changing Rooms Were Vastly Better Quality And More Like What I Would Expect From An Establishment Such As Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,161,Pool Changing Room Can Be Very Cramped When Busy Making Changing Difficult. The Golf Course Score Card Needs A Map Of The Course Or At Least Some Arrows Directing Players To The Next Tee. The Children's Playground Has No Swings / Slides For Very Young Children. Tvs In Lodge Lounge And Bedrooms Are Very Small.  Rubbish Collection From Lodges Could Have Been Better Organised And There Should Be Different Containers For Recycling Eg Paper And Glass.,,,,,
,168,The Carpetting In Lodges Were Not Up To Standard In Cleanliness.   A Wood Flooring Would Be Easier To Maintain And Keep Clean.,,,,,
,170,The Room Service Menu In The Lodges Was Poor. You Do Advertise The Lodges As Being Able To Use The Room Serivce Menu But 24 Hour Notice On Some Orders And Burgers Or Pizza On The Night Was Not What We Expected. Similarly The Tv Channels Didn't Work Propoerly And We Did Call 4 Times To Ask For Someone To Come And Fix Them. Int He End We Were Embarressed To Call Again!,,,,,
,172,Improve The Service (For Clarity The Staff Were All Charming But They Seemed To Lack A Bit Of Leadership) And The Food (The Price Did Not Match The Quality),,,,,
,180,Your Signage Inside The Hotel Is Inadequate.  There Is One Sign Pointing To The Pro Shop  Spa  Pool  Etc.  But Then It Is Completely Unclear Where To Go And How To Find Any Given Thing.  Twice We Had To Go Back To The Front Desk (Once For The Golf  Once For The Spa).  Similarly  That The Pool Has A Code On The Door Was A Surprise.  I Learnt The Code Just By Happenstance (An Employee Happened To Be Nearby -- Not Normal).  Obviously Each Of These Problems Only Occurs Once  But There Is No Reason That These Issues Cannot Be Easily Avoided.,,,,,
,181,There Was No Outdoor Seating On The Sunday Afternoon We Were There. Also There Were No Parasols And Generally The Outdoor Facilities Were Poor. The Tables At The Bistro Were Dirty  No Cushions On Chairs And Not Kept Neatly.,,,,,
,182,We Were Surprised That Our Room Was Across A Courtyard And As It Rained We Got Wet On Our Way To Dinner. Perhaps Umbrellas Could Be Offered.,,,,,
,183,I Was Very Cross That Guests In The Same Party Paid Different Rates. I Was Told That Â£249 Was A Discounted Wedding Party Rate And Didn't Include Breakfast  Although I Think The Current Website Shows That Â£249 Is The Cheapest Room You Have Anyway Without A Discount!  My Son Had A Junior Suite Room For His 2 Children  Which Was Also Â£249 And Included Breakfast For The 4 Of Them!   Although I Raised This At The Time Of Booking I Was Told That Was The Rate! As It Was Obviously A Large Wedding Party  I Think It Is Very Short Sighted Of You Not To Treat Everyone The Same!!!,,,,,
,185,Room Cleanliness E.G. Carpet Edges Etc.  Need Closer Attention. A Filthy Stained Cloth Was Left Laying In The Bedroom Corridor For Some Length Of Time. Also There Is A Trip Hazard On Raised Wooden Threshold & Loose Carpet At The Double Doors At The Head Of The Stairway  1St Floor.,,,,,
,186,The Gratuity System Is Obscure If You Are On A Pre-Paid Package.   And Most Importantly The Waiting Staff Appear Not To Understand The System Either.,,,,,
,191,No,,,,,
,193,Please See Previous Comments Regarding Rooms And Meals For Children,,,,,
,194,Because We Were Part Of A Large Group Drinks Were Put On Various Bills And Got A Little Confused. Would Have Helped To Have A List Of All The Drinks Rather Than Just Summaries,,,,,
,195,Freshly Cooked Breakfast On A Sunday.,,,,,
,197,We Were Unable To Use Our Room Safe Despite Reporting The Problem Twice. This Caused Some Inconvenience In Having To Carry Our Valuables Around!,,,,,
,198,It Was Mentioned At Booking That It Was A Birthday Treat And We Wanted A Special Lunch And Would Be Happy To Pay Extra For A More Extensive Menu Than The Groupon Spa Package But This Was Not Offered When We Went For Lunch And We Did Not Want To Make A Fuss And Ask For It  Also We Were Put On A Table In The Middle Of The Room With Children All Around When A Quieter Table Would Have Been More Appropriate.,,,,,
,200,You Had Missed Something Off The Bill So We Pointed That Out To You! Also Itemised Bills Or Copies Of Receipts Would Have Been Useful For Bar Food  Dinner  Etc.,,,,,
,203,A Wider Choice Of Menu In The Castle Bistro. A Bit Limited.,,,,,
,204,The Room Was Hot.,,,,,
,208,An Important Telephone Message Should Have Been Passed Onto Us Wed 13Th Feb Around 7Pm,,,,,
,210,No,,,,,
,214,Warmer Bedroom  Heated Towel Rail  No Login For The Internet   And A Daily Change In Evening Menu.,,,,,
,217,The Bistro Let Us Down Both With Food And Service And Because We Were With Children It Was The Most Suitable Option,,,,,
,219,One Small Point On Booking I Did Point Out That It Was A 40Th Birthday Celebration  And I Have Stayed In Some Very Good 4 & 5 Star Holidays  And When It Has Been Point Out That Its A Special Occasion There Has Been An Small Acknowledgment So Was Very Surprised That This Didn't Happen Here.,,,,,
,225,Been Explicit About Needing To Pre-Book Spa Treatments Due To Very High Demand On Saturdays,,,,,
,235,Little Disappointed With All The Service Charges Through Out The Stay  Bit Of A Shock At The End When Paying.,,,,,
,238,We Were A Little Disappointed That The 'Daily' Bird Of Prey Display Didn't Take Place On Monday - We Opted For A Morning Run And Late Breakfast In Sunday So Missed It.  On Monday Morning The Restaurant Was Very Quiet At Breakfast So Some Music Would Have Perhaps Made The Parents Of A Young Baby Not Feel They Had To Shush His Every Gurgle.,,,,,
,241,No It Was Excellent And We Are Thinking Of Coming Back In May  Loved The Relaxed Feel Of The Hotel And Expecially Liked Getting The Big Chair By The Roaring Fire For The Evening Of Our Nights Stay,,,,,
,243,My Only Criticisms Are That The Bar Service Became Very Slow During Peak Times (Before And After Dinner) - We Waited Over 15 Minutes For A Round Of Drinks Which Is Rather A Long Time - And The Turn Down Service Brought A Delicious Bag Of Homemade Fudge On The First Night But Then Not Again On The Other Two Nights. If You Are Going To Ration The Fudge Then I Would Suggest Leaving It On The Final Night Ratehr Than The First.,,,,,
,244,We Were Offered A Heater For Our Room When We Asked About The Heating  However  It Never Arrived.,,,,,
,249,No,,,,,
,251,Whilst I Appreciate Bovey Is A Place To Relax And Switch Off  It Is Somewhat Frustrating To Have Little To No Phone Signal. I Do Find It Frustrating When Prople Are Permanently On Their Phones As This Can Ruin A 'Get Away'  However A Signal In The Room Would Be Appreciated Just In Case There Was A Family Issue And I Needed To Be Contacted.,,,,,
,253,No,,,,,
,257,Refer Other Comments Fridge In The Room Would Be Helpful.,,,,,
,259,Overall It Was A Great Visit.  I Know It Was A New Year Package And Noise Levels Are Going To Be High But Not Every Family Has Young Children.  No Area Was Child Free - Not Even The Main Bar After 8Pm.  You Couldn't Use The Dance Floor Until Gone 0030Am Due To Pogoing Children Everywhere. The Live Entertainment Was Ok But I Don't Think It Match The Quality And Standards Of Bovey Castle And A 'Gala Black Tie' Event. Dogs In The Dining Room (Unless A Guide Dog) Is A Big No No For Me,,,,,
,264,Shame The Newspapers Were Cleared Away During The Early Evening - I Came Down About 7Pm To Sit For 10 Mins Wanting To Read The Paper.  Also  Would Have Loved A Few Glossy Magazines In The Various Lounges - Not Just The Freebies Such As Exeter Life.  Normally Really Enjoy This In Hotels We Stay In.,,,,,
,265,No Just Keep Up The Good Work,,,,,
,266,We Had A Lovely Time  Really Relaxing And Luxurious.,,,,,
,269,Evening Dining Could Have Been Better  We Both Felt That The Food Should Have Been Better.,,,,,
,270,We Cannot Think Of Anything That Would Improve The Stay,,,,,
,273,Falconry Cancelled Unfortunately,,,,,
,280,When Leaving Our Luggage Was Taken To The Car Whch Was Still Parked In The Car Park And Then We Were Left Without Being Able To Get The Car Out Because Another Car Was Parked In Front. Not A Great Way To Finish The Weekend. The Telephone Hotspots Didn't Work Which Was Extremely Frustrating.,,,,,
,282,Clean The Valance Sheet & Cushion Covers.,,,,,
,284,The Waiter In The Bar Could Have Been More Attentive As My Husband Had An Empty Drink For Quite A While.,,,,,
,288,Better Mattress,,,,,
,290,The Edwardian Dining Room Meal Was Overpriced For What It Was  Very Small Portions - A Bit Ostentatious. For Example - My Starter Was Lobster Ravioli - This Consisted Of One Ravioli With A Bit Of Froth On Top!! If You Look On Trip Adviser You Will See That Many Other People Have Said The Same ,,,,,
,294,I Did Not Feel That My Celebration Was Acknowledged By The Hotel And That The Dining Venues And The Quality Of The Food Did Not Meet The 5 Star Experience I Was Expecting.,,,,,
,295,It Was Disappointing That The Spa Reflexology That We Had Asked For And Thought Was On The Tuesday Had In Fact Been Booked On The Wednesday  By Which Time We Would Have Left. We Should Have Studied The Bookings List More Closely When We Arrived And Then We Would Have Picked Up The Error.,,,,,
,298,I Would Be Most Happy To Stay At Bovey Castle Simply To Enjoy The Experience Of Being Looked After And To Enjoy All The Facilities On Offer.,,,,,
,300,Our Guests Were Very Happy With The Weekend.,,,,,
,301, Not Really  Especially As You Arranged Probably The Best Weather That Dartmoor Has Seen In A Long Time,,,,,
,302,One Small Niggle - Room Service Breakfast Was Not Quite Right Each Morning Ie Day 1 Requested Mushrooms  Got Beans. Day 2 Toast Came Without Butter  And Day 3 Full Cooked Breakfast Arrived Without Bacon.,,,,,
,303,Better Phone Signal Coverage.,,,,,
,304,Check Out Was Disappointing  Didn't Enquire If We'd Had A Good Stay. There Were Service Charges Which Appeared For Every Item On The Bill. Restaurant Had Agreed To Take Off Items From The Bill  But Hard To Work Out Whether Had Been Removed From The Bill.  Quite Abrupt Checkout Which Made It Difficult To Query The Bill Without Making A Scene.,,,,,
,306,Advise The Guests Of Where Their Car Is Parked Upon Departure - We Did Not Know Where Ours Was. Keep The Hotel Warmer On A Cold And Rainy Day.  Prices For Food In The Bistro Are Too High For What Is Being Served.,,,,,
,308,Nothing,,,,,
,309,Great Place  Found Breakfast On The First Day Disappointing  Service Slow  Food Pre Cooked And In Heaters But Second Day Different  Food Cooked Fresh From The Kitchen. At This Sort Of Establishment I Don't Think Warmed Hot Breakfast Suits The Style. Keep The Old Method Freshly Cooked Please,,,,,
,310,My Husband And I Very Much Enjoyed The Falconry Experience. The Two Person Minimum Requirement Prevented Me From Enjoying A Few Days Of The Halk Walk.,,,,,
,311,I Can Honestly Say It Was One Of The Best Hotels My Family And I Have Ever Stayed At. The 'Home Away From Home' Feel Was Spot On. Just Wish We Could Have Stayed Longer! Overall Experience Could Not Be Faulted- Just Those Few Things About Service Being A Little Quicker.,,,,,
,314,Make Sure The Reservation Department Actualy Listen To Customer Requests And Questions. We Almost Did Not Come Because Of The Poor Way They Directed The Reservation Process.,,,,,
,315,The Only Complaint I Have At All Is Regarding The Dining  The Venison Was Overcooked And I Noticed The Red Wine For Our Table Being Opened As We Walked Into The Dining Room  I Would Have Expected Red Wines To Have Been Opened At Least An Hour Before Hand In Order To Breath  It Is A Shame Because They Were Ordered In Plenty Of Time For That. Otherwise Our Weekend With You Was Exceptional And We Will Be Returning In The Future. Many Thanks To All The Staff And Management For A Lovely Weekend.,,,,,
,316,We Didn't Eat In The Main Restaurant As We Wanted Somewhere Less Formal  However We Did Not Choose To Eat In The Bistro As We Felt That It Was More Of A 'Daytime' Menu (Eg Pizza/Burger Etc). We Liked The Informality Of The Bistro And Were Rather Disappointed Not To Eat There In The Evening As Well.,,,,,
,317,Just The Points Mention Re The Lodge.,,,,,
,318,We Stayed In The Rose Cottage . One Of The Fire Places Was Defect. This I Reported The Day After Arrival. The Reception Immediately Sent The Handyman (?) Over  However The Problem Was Out Of Their Control And Gas Techs Needed To Be Called In. Unfortunately This Had Not Been Solved Before Our Departure. If The Cottage Was Rented The Week After Our Stay  The Same Complaint Might Have Been Prevented If Solved During Our Stay....,,,,,
,319,We Felt The Exterior Of The Lodge We Stayed In Was Very Poor.  The Decking Outside Needed Attention And Looked Awful.  My Husband Leant On The Handrail One Evening And All The Loose Paint Stuck To His Arm!  It Also Was Very Dark And Overgrown And Just Generally Looked Very Neglected And Was Not An Environment In Which You Would Want To Relax In.,,,,,
,320,We Thought The Exterior Of The Lodge Needed A Lot Of Attention - The Decking Area Was Very Poor And Appeared Quite Dirty.  My Husband Leant On The Handrail And Flaking Paint Was Stuck To His Arm When He Lifted It Up!  It Was Not A Very Comfortable Place To Sit And Was Quite Overgrown And Dark.,,,,,
,321,We Really Loved Our Stay However There Are Just A Couple Of Things That You Might Like To Note.  Breakfast Service Needs To Be Explained By The Waiting Staff - Ie You Can Either Help Yourself Or Order From The Menu.  We Were Not Told This So Missed Out On The Lovely Breakfast.    The Staff Also Need To Know Not To Clear Plates Until Everyone Has Finished Eating At The Table - Its Not Macdonalds!     You Might Like To Change The Staff Smoking Area - When You Go Into The Far Lounge You Can See Staff Standing And Smoking Through The Far Door - Its Not A Big Thing But As They All Work So Hard To Make The Experience So Good For Everyone Its Just A Small Thing That Brings It Down.,,,,,
,322,I Was Asked When I Booked If It Was A Special Occassion And I Said That It Was Our 40Th Wedding Anniversary - I Think That It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Small Arrangement Of Flowers Or Glass On Wine In Our Room When We Arrived.  None Of This Ruined A Really Lovely Weekend.  Thank You,,,,,
,327,The Bar Has An Extensive Range Of Stock  But The Cocktail List Is Rather Small - Could Be Expanded.,,,,,
,329,Our Only Disappointment Was The Bedroom And Bathroom,,,,,
,332,Improve On Bar & Restaurant Service & Quality Of Food.. Our Starter & Dessert Were Very Good But The Main Course Was Poor..,,,,,
,333,We Were Overcharged In The Bistro Which Was Corrected And The Final Bill Also Had Another Overcharge Which Was Also Corrected But As The Bill Was Not Itemized - This Was Not Easy To Spot And I Felt Awkward Asking About Amounts.,,,,,
,334,Our Lodge (Blackingstone) Had A Very Strong Smell Of Oil From The Boiler Area Which Was  Unpleasant. Maintenance Dept Confirmed That Boiler Was Ok. Hall Area Continued To Be Plagued With The Smell Of Oil Which Obviously Built Up When We Returned To The Lodge After An Absence. Create A Flue To The Outside Wall To Dissipate The Smell ?,,,,,
,337,The Room Could Of Been To A Standard Of A Five Star Hotel. We Did Pay The Discretionary Service Charge But We Were Not Aware We Had An Option To Opt Out  No One Explained This.,,,,,
,340,Felt That Some Of The Areas Were Poorly Lit  But In Your Defense  The Ambience Of The Period Was Maintained. (After All Lighting Would Have Been Awful In Those Days) But Found Great Difficulty Reading Menus And Papers.,,,,,
,342,I Have One Small Gripe. To Be Charged Â£2 Surplus On Breakfast Because One Of Us Chose A Â£16.95 Meal Instead Of Â£14.95 Seems Curlish When Breakfast Was Included In A Â£860 2 Night Package. Perhaps You Should Charge A Flat Rate For All Breakfasts To Avoid This Embarrassment.,,,,,
,346,A Warmer Bedroom  Very Disappointing On A Very Cold Night.,,,,,
,347,Because Of Your Audi Conference On The Sunday We Were Made To Feel That We Were Unwelcome In The Hotel After We Had Checked Out.  Our Plan Had Always Been To Make Full Use Of The Facilities On The Sunday With Our Wider Family Before Leaving For Home.  We Visited Bistro And Pool  But Were Told We Weren't Allowed Back In The Main Hotel.  Just Didn't Make For Quite As Relaxing An Afternoon And Made My Mum A Bit Anxious As She Felt We Ought Not To Be There.,,,,,
,350,At Breakfast The Gluten-Free Toast Was Very Slow To Arrive And We Had To Remind Staff Twice. Then They Brought Two Tiny Pieces And We Had To Ask For More. This Did Seem Mean As The Normal Toast Was Plentiful And Brought Early In The Service. There Was A Hair On The Cooked Meal Which Had To Be Sent Back. So The Breakfast Experience Was A Disappointing End To A Wonderful Stay.,,,,,
,351,The Use Of Buggies To Look Round Grounds For All Residents. We Waited 35 Minutes For Room Service To Collect Our Bags They Didn't Come So We Took Our Own Cases To Reception. Service At Breakfast Was Rather Slow.,,,,,
,355,We Were Very Pleased With Location  Welcome And Ambience- But We Had High Expectations Given That The Price Puts Bovey Castle In Same Bracket As Say Tilney Hall Which We Are Very Familiar With. A Few Things Let The Hotel Down Just A Little: Quality Of Changing Rooms And General Ambience Of Spa Area; Dinner Menu; Lack Of Free Broadband Even In Public Rooms And Service At Breakfast Which Was A Bit Chaotic.,,,,,
,359,The Room With All The Noise  Old Matress And Gone Off Milk Let The Stay Down. I Had Spent Alot Of Money For One Night Treat And I Feel A Little Let Down,,,,,
,361,If You Have To Have Piped Music  Please Could It Be Quieter And Not Big Band Stuff.,,,,,
,365,Ipod Dock In Room And Free Internet Should Be Standard In A Five Star Hotel Where There Is Poor Phone Reception.,,,,,
,366,The Service In The Bar Was Slow On Occasion.,,,,,
,367,I Was Disappointed With The Room  As We Had Booked In To A 'Superior Castle Room'.  My Understanding Was That The View Would Be A Partial Courtyard View Or Views Of The Countryside.  We Were Originally Going To Be Staying In Room '54' (According To Our Original Sign In & Car Parking Card)  Which Would Have Meant A Fabulous View  But We Were Placed In Room '13' With Views Of The Car Park.  There Was No Explanation But I Did Not Wish To Complain Too Vigorously In Front Of My Partner As This Was My Present To Him For His 40Th Birthday  And Our Last Trip Away Together Before The Birth Of Our First Child.,,,,,
,369,Served Dinner A Little Earlier! Had Cocktail Experience Which Was Good But Staff Member Spent Quite A Lot Of Time Talking About Himself Rather Than The Cocktails! Very Pleasant Though.,,,,,
,372,Where Did The Little Torches Go? Allowed Slightly Later Check Out. Not Used A Gents Toilet Floor Tile To Display Chocolates On? Again Increased Spa Facilities.,,,,,
,375,Service Was Slow At Times In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,376,Dressing Table In The Bedroom......Was Plenty Of Room To Have One. I Wouldn't Stay With You Again Whilst There Was A Wedding On As I Felt 'Restricted' On The Saturday  In The Grounds And Around The Lounges.  Whilst There Were Areas To Go  It All Felt Rather Busy And Was Obviously More Noisy. Not Quite The Secluded Retreat From Life.,,,,,
,378,Please Ensure That Dog Muck Is Cleaned Up In The Grounds - I Trod In This On My First Day! Inform Customers When Luggage Has Been Delivered To Their Car,,,,,
,379,Warned Us About The Noisy Room (It Was About 10Pm When We Realised And We Were Trying To Get Our 2 Young Kids Settled  So Didn't Want To Swap Rooms)  Or Provided Us With Fans,,,,,
,383,There Was An Embracing Moment With Our Children When Santa Arrived With The Presents. As We Didn't Know He Was Giving Out Presents We Bought The Children To See Him (We Thought That It Was Just A Nice Touch). Unfortunately  Their Names Weren't On The List And Our Five Year Old Was Upset And Thought Santa Had Missed Him. Fredrico Was Very Kind And Gave Him A Present Anyway - Thank You Very Much. However  I Think This Could Have Been Avoided By Either Warning Non-Package Guests That This Was Happening So That They Could Avoid The Situation  Or Better Still Inviting Them To This Special Occasion At A Cost For The Presents. I Hope This Helps!,,,,,
,385,Champagne Flutes And Tall Coffee Cups In The Lodge. Both Were Provided When Requested But Should Come As Standard (In My View!). The Lodges Also Need Somewhere To Hang Coats. Again  A Hat Stand Was Provided When Requested But Something Needs To Be Installed Permanently. A Few Hooks Just Inside The Front Door Would Suffice.,,,,,
,386,Perhaps Just A Bit More Attention At Reception.,,,,,
,387,Ask To Book Tea Time By The Window Inside As It Gets Booked Up Very Quickly. Otherwise It Was A Very Enjoyable Experience If U Except The Service At The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,388,Fix The Quirks Mentioned In One Of The Previous Questions...,,,,,
,389,Made It Easier To Find The Place Coming South From Totnes (We Ended Up Coming Through North Bovey Village Which Was Entertaining!),,,,,
,390,It Would Have Been Perfect If We Had Received Our Room Room Service Order For Our Pre-Dinner Drinks!,,,,,
,392,No,,,,,
,396,No  Just Keep Up The Good Work!,,,,,
,397,Bistro!,,,,,
,398,No,,,,,
,400,We Expected A Lot So Would Have To Say It Meet Expectations In Service And Environment.    We Loved The Laid Back Nature And Comfort Of The Hotel.  It Was Also A Very Welcoming Place For Kids And They Had A Great Time. The Staff Was Excellent.  It Was Very Nice Without Being Stuffy And We Enjoyed Simply Lounging.   The Food Was The Only Thing Lacking -- And To Realize At The End That You Charged 8.50/Each For A Kids Shirley Temple Is Ridiculous  Especially Considering The Number Our Kids Consumed.  The Wine Was Less!,,,,,
,403,The Background Music Played In The Afternoon And Evening In The Public Rooms Detracted From The Atmosphere - I Suspect This Is Very Much A Personal Experience.,,,,,
,404,No  Everybody Was Excellent And The Whole Experience Was Delightful. Thank You.,,,,,
,407,Breakfast - I Do Not Expect To Have To Ask For My Teacup To Be Changed Because Of Chips In It  And There Were Also Chips In The Sugar Bowl  This Is Not Acceptable In Any Level Of Establishment. The Haddock At Breakfast Was A Very Small Portion And Not As Good As I Have Experienced In Numerous Other Hotels. Breakfast Was Certainly The Weakest Element Of The Experience. (The Granola And Dried Fruits Were Very Good!),,,,,
,408,Bistro Service Needs Some Improvements - Appears To Be Headcount Related.,,,,,
,413,Stop The Rain!,,,,,
,414,We Signed Up For The Meal Plan And I Was Not Really Clear How That Worked- I Thought We Paid Â£100 Extra For The Plan Which Must Not Have Been Right Because We Got A Â£45 Credit For The Dinner... Also- We Did Horse Riding One Afternoon And The Directions That Reception Gave Us To The Stables Were Appalling And It Took Us Over An Hour To Get There. The Stables Said That Other Guests Had Complained As Well.,,,,,
,415,No I Was Very Happy There As Was My Wife And Son.,,,,,
,417,Service A Little Quicker For Drinks And For Room Service,,,,,
,420,Service Charge Should Be Incorporated Into Rates Lovely Property And Location With Pleasant Staff  Needing Capital Investment In Rooms And Bathrooms. Signs Of Cost Cutting Inappropriate For A Quality Hotel - No Room Heating Until 6Pm On Cool October Days Disgraceful,,,,,
,421,Walking Trails Could Be Better Signed,,,,,
,423,No  All Our Needs Were Taken Care Of  Thank You.  ,,,,,
,424,I Genuinely Believe There Is Nothing That I Can Offer Apart From The Heating Issue (But It's A Minor Thing Really).,,,,,
,428,Provide Lockers In The Pool Changing Rooms - Called Down Once Or Twice To Ask Us If All Was Okay With Our Lodge,,,,,
,431,Service Bad,,,,,
,433,We Reported The Dirty Light Above Our Bed And We Were Disapointed With The Lack Of Response From Reception As We Had Hoped We Would Have Been Encouraged To Stay Again .,,,,,
,434,Our Stay Was Pleasurable And The Overall Experience Was Consistent With Our Expectations Of A 5* Hotel.,,,,,
,435,Offering High Speed Internet Access In The Room Or Being Made Aware That We Could Upgrade.,,,,,
,436,The Issues Set Out Above Could Be Rectified - Your Hotel Is Sold On The Basis Of A 'Special Luxury Experience' And Small Things Such As Sufficiency Of Consumables In The Room And 'Service' Should Not Be Areas Where Savings Are Made.,,,,,
,437,We Just Want To Come Back Soon!,,,,,
,439,From Our Room And On The Ground Floor We Could Smell The Fryers In The Bistro. Think The Oil Needed Changing.,,,,,
,440,Re Above - Fortunate We Checked The Boot To See If Suitcases Were There - There Were Not  Manager Most Apologetic And Hoped It Did Not Spoil Our Stay - It Did Not But Would Have Had We Got Home And Discovered An Empty Boot!!,,,,,
,442,The Wedding Was Exactly As Howard And Melissa Planned And We Are Grateful To All Members Of Staff Who Worked To Make This A Special Day For Them.,,,,,
,443,The Ability To Order A Cocktail  Which Was Not On The Bar Menu  Was A Little Tricky  But This Eventually Was Served (White Lady). Room 57 (A Beautiful Room): Tcmf Cupboard Needs A Light  And Also A Top Door Vent To Permit Kettle Steam Release.,,,,,
,444,Only 1 English Breakfast Teabag In The Bedroom. Had To Ask To Get Semi Skimmed Milk For The Room.,,,,,
,456,While We Were Staying At The Hotel  We Were Very Interested In Seeing If We Could Purchase One Of The Decorative Items In The Room (A Large Glass Paperweight). We Saw The Housekeeper Who Subsequently Told Us By E-Mail The Provenance Of The Item  But We Are Only In The Area Once In A Blue Moon So We Cannot Do Much About It. What We Wanted To Do Was Possibly To Purchase The Item From You. Alas  No Luck!,,,,,
,457,That Depends On Whether You Are Able To Guarantee Sunshine Rather Than Rain !!!,,,,,
,460,Three Issues Listed Above About Room Need Attention But Otherwise We Were Delighted With Our Stay. Your Tip Policy Is Wrong--You Should Leave It To The Guest--5% Is Too Much.,,,,,
,466,Received Wrong Food At Breakfast  Otherwise Perfect!,,,,,
,467,Better Maintenance Of Castle And Pool Area!!,,,,,
,474,Better Cleanliness Of Rooms With Clean Cushions And Fresh Paintwork/Grouting In The Bathroom Would Be Expected. If There Is A Way To Reduce Noise From The Lift This Would Also Be Beneficial.,,,,,
,477,No,,,,,
,488,If You Are Hosting An Event And Do Not Have The Capacity Or The Will To House Other Guests  Please Let Them Know You Are Full To Avoid Dissappointment.  I Stay In Devon Every 2 Weeks With Work And Was Recommended Bovey Castle By A Customer.  However  You Did Not Meet Expectation And Are Not In The Same League As Other 5 Star Hotels I Use Regularly.,,,,,
,489,For 5* I Expected Much More. Staff Not Have Knowledge And Let The Hotel Down. Lego Concierge Excellent  Keys Behind Desk Need Serious Organisation  Pool And Cabins,,,,,
,491,The Expectation Would Have Been Met If The Service Was More Outstanding During Dinner  Also We Were Somewhat Surprised With The Added Service Charges  And The Pay For The Internet Connection. Would It Not Be Better To Included This Overall In The Price Of The Room? We Really Enjoyed The Surroundings  Great Atmosphere  Friendly Staff And Outstanding Food.,,,,,
,492,It's A Small Thing  But In Hotels I've Stayed In Before  Usually All The Staff Would Nod  Say 'Good Morning' Or Some Form Of Acknowledgment When Passing Customers In The Corridors. This Didn't Happen With Me. Again  Not A Real Issue  But Still A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,493,We Were Told Voluntarily By Staff The Day Before That There Is A Ghost Living At The Castle Named Oscar. We Were A Little Uneasy  But We Didn't See Anything 'Unusual' While We Were There So No Harm Done. (I Would Have Rather Not Known About Any Ghost Stories!),,,,,
,498,The Experience Was Great  But Having Stayed In A Considerable Number Of High Quality Hotels As Part Of My Work I Think The Food Was A Bit Of A Let Down And I Think It Is Perhaps A Little Overly Ambitiously Priced.,,,,,
,499,Better Service Throughout Hotel.,,,,,
,502,Something Special To Acknowledge That It Was Our Wedding Anniversary.,,,,,
,506,It Was Disappointing That There Was Quite Often A Vacuum Cleaner Abandoned Outside My Room For Hours At A Time.  There Were Also Dirty Glasses Left Lying Around (For Example On The Shelf By The Lift) That Went For Nearly 24 Hours Before They Were Removed.  There Was Clearly General Confusion At Breakfast One Morning - We Waited A Very Long Time For Our Order To Be Taken (Also On Other Mornings)  Then We Were Brought The Wrong Food  Then There Were Eggs Missing From My Mother's Breakfast.  She Couldn't Be Bothered To Complain In The End As We Had Been Waiting For So Long.,,,,,
,507,Long Queue At Time Of Check Out  Needed More Staff On Front Desk.,,,,,
,508,Not To Of Been Made To Feel We Were Trying To Steal Dressing Gowns,,,,,
,509,Staff Attentiveness Was Our Main Issue  And The Long Wait Times At Both Breakfast And Dinner Was Not To The Standard We Experienced Previously,,,,,
,514,Was Disappointed Not To Have Been Offered An Upgrade For Our Special Occasion  However Our Stay Was Awesome.,,,,,
,515,Acknowledged The Mistakes In The Restaurant.,,,,,
,522,Have More Mountain Bikes Available  Some Facilities Well Posted Lke The Trampoline,,,,,
,530,We Didnt Have Hot Water When We Had A Shower On Sun Morning. Very Disappointing.,,,,,
,549,Improve The Quality Of The Service In The Restaurants.,,,,,
,552,Disappointed To See A More Senior Member Of Staff Disipline More Junior Members In Full View Of Guests Shortly After Breakfast.  Whilst This Is Obviously Necessary To Maintain Standards I Would Expect Hotel Of This Quality To Deal With These Things Out Of Sight Of Guests.,,,,,
,554,Wedding In Progress Meant Staff Were Busy And Coffees  Food Orders  Drink Etc Were Slow. Staff Commented They Were Too Busy And Under Staffed.,,,,,
,555,To Be Honest  It Was Just The Food At The Evening Meal Which Just Left Slightly Wanting. I Am A Dessert Kind Of Girl  But Decided I Didn't Want To Try Anything As I Had Been Disappointed With My Main. The Starter Of The Selection Of Meats Was Delicious Though ... Hard To Get That Wrong!,,,,,
,558,Guided Tour Of The Estate,,,,,
,559,On Our Arrival We Asked Of We Could Book Some Spa Treatments  There Was No Time Free At All. Treatment Times Were Booked By Non Residence. For Guests Staying At The Hotel I Would Have Expected That Times Would Have Been Free.,,,,,
,561,Improved Service  Better Quality Bedrooms. Cheaper Phone Rates In Rooms As Service Was Unavailable.,,,,,
,566,A Courtesy Call From The Kitchen Via Reception To Let Us Know That Our Meal Would Take An Hour To Prepare Or At Least An Apology On Delivery Would Have Been Appreciated.,,,,,
,569,Checking Out Was Difficult.  Our Debit Card Was Not Declined  But Referred I.E. It Required The Receptionist To Call The Bank For Security Purposes.  This Did Not Happen  So We Had To Use A Different Card.  We Checked With The Bank And They Said It Was Simply A Fraud Protection Mechanism.,,,,,
,573,More Ventilation; Double Glass,,,,,
,575,One Thing I Would Suggest That Would Have Been Better  We Had Kart With Beer Which Was Warm  A Cool Box Or A Cart That You Could Load Ice Into To Keep Refreshments Cool And Cold Would Of Been Better. Plus It Would Of Probably Meant We/Other Would Drink A Little More If The Beverages Were Cold.,,,,,
,576,The Breakfast Did Not Represent Value For Money At All And The Quality Was Well Below What Should Be Served.,,,,,
,580,Mini-Fridge In The Room Was Broken (And The Milk In There Was Off So We Had To Ask For More).,,,,,
,581,I Had Stayed At Your Hotel Previously With My Wife And Dog So Had Huge Expectations  But Did Feel Slightly Let Down With The Whole Business Experience (Maybe This Had Partly To Do With The Snow),,,,,
,582,Perhaps Putting A Spa Menu In The Room  - More Likely To Book. Also A Pre-Warning When Booking That Tea In Front Of The Fire Needs To Be Reserved  Just Because Of The Popularity!,,,,,
,584,Advised Need To Book Afternoon Tea On Arrival.,,,,,
,586,I Believe The Housekeeping Came As Early As 8:30 Am.  It Was A Too Early Than Most Hotel And I Was Awaken One Time.  Next Day  I Remembered To Put Up The 'Do Not Disturb' Sign.,,,,,
,587,A Shower Door Was Missing In The Ladies Changing For The Pool. A Bar Of Soap For The Rose Cottage Kitchen Would Also Be Welcome  I'm Now Suffering With Sore Hands After Having To Use The Washing Up Liquid For Hand-Washing Before And During Food Prep For A Week. We Love Cooking And A Rationalization Of The Kitchen Provisions At Rose Cottage Would  I Think  Improve Our Enjoyment Of Preparing Food In The Cottage  Along The Lines Of My Comments Above.,,,,,
,589,The Food Was Average  Which Was A Little Disappointing.,,,,,
,594,It Seems Wrong To Make Any Suggestions When We Had Such A Perfect Stay  But The Addition Of A Coat Rack On The Porch Or Lobby Which Lodge Guests Could Simply Put Their Coats On As They Come And Go  Rather Than Having To Hand Them To Staff Every Time  Would Be A Welcoming Touch  And Would Help To Make Those Coming Up To The Hotel Regularly For Meals Feel More 'At Home'.,,,,,
,596,I Think Some Staff Need A Better Understanding Of The English Language.,,,,,
,599,The Only Complaint I Had Was At Breakfast We Had To Ask For Butter Twice And Still Did Not Receive So In The End Gave Up.  Again For Me This Is Not A Big Deal But I Felt The Staff In The Breakfast Area Did Not Look Up Enough So I Could Grab Someone's Attention.  Maybe Not Attentive Enough Would Be The Comment.,,,,,
,601,Saturday Afternoon Was Very Busy And The Catering Staff Were Not As Attentive As Usual But When They Were Serving Us They Were Professional  Helpful And Friendly,,,,,
,603,I Think When You Are A Resident You Should Not Add A Discretionary Charge To Dining.  I Was Very Disappointed In The Stay.  The Very First Time We Came I Felt Really Special  And It Was A Lovely Treat  This Time I Felt It Was Just Like Any Other Hotel  Everything Had A Price And It Was All About Making Money.,,,,,
,604,Not Make Mistakes  Make Sure Every Facility Is Working As Advertised Or Inform People Visiting If Not  Communicate With Each Other In Order That You Don't Spoil Surprises,,,,,
,608,I Think The Waiting Staff Just Need To Be A Bit More 'On The Ball'.  When We Had Finished Lunch In One Of The Sitting Rooms  Even Though Staff Were In The Room Our Empty Plates Were Still In Front Of Us For 20 Minutes As Various Staff Walked Past.  The Food In The Edwardian Restaurant (Where We Ate Twice) Was Variable At Best. Also The Mini Bar In The Room Was Very Spartan With Only Water And Some Milk In There. I Would Have Expected A Full Mini-Bar.  Free Wifi Should Be Standard In A Top-End Hotel. Also  While I Was Waiting At Reception  One Of The Staff Behind The Desk Asked Another One To Do Something For Her And Said 'Because They're F*Cking Useless'. I Was Surprised To Hear Such Language Used With Guests In The Vicinity.,,,,,
,609,The Edwardian Was A Disappointment Unfortunately  And The Food Generally Could Do With Some Improvement In Terms Of Quality And Variety  And Generosity Of Portion/Serve.  The Play Barn Was Not Supervised On The Second Day We Stayed  Which Was Also Disappointing.,,,,,
,610,Treat Me Like A Paying Guest.  Service Fell Very  Very Short Of What I Would Expect From A 2 Star Hotel. Changing Rooms For Your Pool Were Very Sub Standard. No Lockers Or Shelving And The Room Was Very Cold. Would Have Been Nice To Have A Couple Of Individual Changing Rooms (Only 2 Toilets - Not Ideal To Change In).,,,,,
,612,The Pool Area Was Disappointing. Being Integrated Within The Pool  We Found The Jacuzzi Cold. Appreciating It Was The End Of Half Term Week  The Noise Levels Made A Visit To The Pool Area Far From Relaxing. We Felt We Could Have Been At One Of The Well Know Uk Forrest Parcs Not A Luxury Castle Hotel.,,,,,
,614,The Only Slight Disappointment Of Our Stay Was The Service Received At Breakfast On Both Mornings - This Was Quite Slow And Certainly Not As Friendly As Was Our Experience The Rest Of The Time.,,,,,
,615,We Have Stayed In Some Wonderful Hotels And Bovey Is No Exception  However  In Our Opinion The Overall Experience Fell Short Of Our Expectations Through The Attention To Detail - I Would Add That Staff Shortages Could Have Been A Factor,,,,,
,616,Billing Is Slightly Confusing -  Access To Shower Room/Chnaging Rooms To The Pool Is Very Confusing (And Particularly With Regards Keys For Lockers),,,,,
,618,See Q12,,,,,
,620,A Few Areas Around Could Do With A Tidy Up  Like The Raised Area/ Roof You Can See From The Grill. A Sweep Up And Few More Flower Pots Maybe. Also Worn Carpet On Stairs And Stains On Bedroom Wall Paper. Only Minor Suggestions.,,,,,
,623,Umbrellas In The Lodges!,,,,,
,628,The Facilities Were Not As Good Or Easily Accessible As I Was Told Before Arriving. We Were Told We Didn't Need To Bring Tennis Rackets But Then Were Rarely Able To Get Hold Of Any To Play With From Reception Even When Courts Were Completely Empty - There Needs To Be A Better Process For Return Of Rackets. The Badminton Court Was Not Ready And Neither Was The Cricket Net - Both Of Which The Kids Were Looking Forward To Using,,,,,
,631,It Was Unusual Not To Receive Some Small Nibbles/Olives When Drinking In The Bar  Which I Would Have Expected In A Hotel Of That Standard. We Had To Ask For Them.,,,,,
,632,For Such An Incredibly Beautiful Building That Has So Much Character The Main House Felt Shabby And In Need Of Overall Redecoration And Thorough Clean.  The Restaurant To The Right Felt Like A Canteen With No Atmosphere  Very Badly Designed Interior For The Building's Overall Look And Feel.,,,,,
,637,Our Dinner Tray Wasn't Removed For A Few Hours After Being Told It Would Be Collected. The Milk In Our Fridge Was Off (Although Within Date  So Not A Hotel Issue). We Had To Wait Over Half An Hour For Our Breakfast. We Had To Wait A Long Time For Our Luggage To Be Brought Down When We Were Leaving. The Tray Charge For Room Service Seemed A Bit Excessive As There Was Also The Service Charge.,,,,,
,638,The Receptionist Staff Should All Be Replaced Or Re-Trained.,,,,,
,641,As  Before,,,,,
,642,Overall Bovey Is An Excellent Venue  Especially If You Have Young Children Or A Dog. Our Room Was Slightly Below Par  But This Didn't Significantly Detract From Our Stay. We,,,,,
,643,Although We Had A Relaxing Time At Bovey  And We Will Come Back Again  We Do Think It Lacked Some Of Its Usual Welcoming Atmosphere.,,,,,
,646,Breakfast Selection Was Excellent  But Food And Drink Not Hot Enough And Poor Attention To Detail By Staff  Appeared To Lack Organisation.,,,,,
,650,Forgot To Say The Blonde Lady On Arrival Was Very Helpful And Polite. Good Service,,,,,
,651,As I Mentioned  It Very Much Was A Visit Of Two Halves:  The First Half Was Mediocre  Largely Driven By The Dining Experience; The Second Half Was Excellent  As The Dining Experience Recovered From Subpar.  The Grounds And Pool/Spa Are Beautiful.  Second  For A Hotel Of This Price Point And Obviously Positioning Itself To Be 'Kid Friendly'  The Room Service Coordination Is Very Lacking.  It Should Be 'Easy' To Order  Take Delivery And Feed Kids In The Room.  It Wasn't On Many Levels...  Moreover  It Appeared That The Staff Didn't Really 'Do' Room Service Or Know What Was Expected.,,,,,
,652,Just The Few Niggles With The Food Mentioned Earlier In The Survey.,,,,,
,656,No,,,,,
,657,It Would Be Advantageous To Be Able To View Films For Over 12 Hours.  We Started To Watch A Film After Dinner And Then Tried To Complete It After Breakfast  However It Was Out Of The 12 Hour Window.,,,,,
,658,As Mentioned Before  The One Area That Is A Bit Lacking Is The Service Levels. In Particular  When A Guest Reports A Problem With A Lodge It Should Be Sorted Out Quickly. The Telephone In Our Lodge Didnt Work Properly For The Whole Two Weeks We Were There!,,,,,
,660,Offered 'Egg Hunting' In The Morning For The Kids But When They Got There  A Staff Member Had Already Collected The Eggs So There Were None For Them To Find.  I Understand Things Are Quieter In Winter But Don't Offer Services If Hey Aren't Really Going To Be Provided,,,,,
,663,My Husband Took Care Of Check Out  So Can't Comment On 21.  Loved All The Activities There. Definitely Recommending To Our Friends. Thank You So Much For A Wonderful Weekend!,,,,,
,664,Use Of Judgement Re Check In Time - Remember People Are Coming From Great Distances And Can't Always Time It To Arrive Later Than 3Pm,,,,,
,666,Please Improve Your Staff And The Atmosphere At The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,669,Breakfast Service Was Poor  Duck Eggs With Truffle Shavings Arrived Minus The Shavings - An Unfortunate Poor Last Impression.,,,,,
,676,Please See My Comments On Reception Earlier. It Was Sad That We Had A Poor Experience As Otherwise We Had A Very Good Stay.,,,,,
,679,I Don't Believe It Was The Hotel's Fault  However; Slh Membership Did Not Appear To Come Through At Check-In Or Register During Checkout Which Required Sorting Out Some Charges Which Are Normally Free With Slh Membership.,,,,,
,680,No,,,,,
,681,These Days Why A Discretionary Service Charge?,,,,,
,682,Lots!,,,,,
,685,The Setting Makes It. Amazing Landscape And Plenty To Do. We Tried Archery/Air Rifles And Fly Fishing.  Fly Fishing Was Excellent. Archery Felt Like It Was For Children With The Arrows Half Broken With Bits Missing And No Real Instruction Whatsoever.  The Air Rifle Section Was A Joke - An .22 Air Rifle But Only With  0.177 Pellets Which For Anyone Who Knows Anything About Air Guns Knows Its Ridiculous.  Like Eating Soup With A Ladle And The Air Pistol Looked Like It Was Older Than I With An Aim That Just Turned Freely Around The Barrel.  This Needs Much Improvement.  The Fly Fishing Was Good Fun  Quite Expensive For What It Is But Good Fun.,,,,,
,688,No Was Fantastic!,,,,,
,695,All Staff Were Truely Fabulous  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble,,,,,
,697,Invest A Little Time And Money In The Details Of The Bedrooms,,,,,
,701,A Few Things: 1) Give Us Better Rooms (Or Improve The Rooms That Need It So All Meet Minimum Expectations For 5 Star) 2) Make Sure You Don't Make Customers Wait When They Want More Drinks In The Bar (I Shouldn't Have To Ask) 3) You Screwed Up Our Spa Appointment (Front Desk Told Us We Could Have An Appointment At 11 For 2 People And It Turned Out There Was A Mis-Communication On The Hotel's Part And All We Got Was An Apology And Suggestion To Take A Different Time  This Screw Up Was Not Acceptable And More Should Have Been Done To Either Figure Out A Solution That Worked Or To Comp Us Something For The Hassle) 4) Address The Dining Situation  Especially Edwardian Grill Atmosphere & Menu Variety / Value,,,,,
,702,No,,,,,
,705,A Bench Near The Trampoline To Sit On While The Children Play Would Be Nice. Imporve Your Internet Capabilites Improve The Quality Of Food Offered And Improve Service In The Oak Bar It Was Very Slow!,,,,,
,706,Our Room Tariff Included Dinner  However  No Where On The Evening Menu Did It Mention What Inclusive Residents Could Eat. We Ordered Starters And Mains And I Asked The Waiter Whether Dessert Was Included And He Answered Yes. However  We Had A Supplement Added To Our Bill As We Later Found Out We Only Had A Â£45 Allowance. This Was Not Made Clear At Any Point.,,,,,
,707,When I Was Quoted For The Room I Was Not Told Of A 15% Service Charge  And I Did Not Realise That It Was Discretionary Until I Read The Comment Above.,,,,,
,709,We Were Promised A Pick Up From The Lodge One Evening To Take Us To The Main Hotel For Afternoon Tea.  This Did Not Arrive And We Were Left In The Pouring Rain Waiting With Two Elderly Ladies!!!,,,,,
,711,Much Of Bovey Castle Is Brilliant - A Few Tweaks To Service And Food And This Review Would Be Much Higher. The Wine Tasting Was Done With The Really Lovely Sommelier - And She Was Totally Friendly Etc So No Complaints At All About Her - We Really Liked Her -But Felt That The Experience As Marketed  Suggested A Much More Experienced Individual (Fully Qualified Sommelier).,,,,,
,712,Great Stay Overall. I Think More Training Is Neeed On Room Service Staff And Procedures. We Had Rooms Ervice Breakfast Both Mornings. Both Mornings Items Were Forgotten (Tea/ Cups Etc) But Also The Presentation Was Very Different From Onemorning To The Other. However It All Tasted Delicious And The Staff Were Very Friendly And Smiley. They Make Bovey Castle The Place That It Is.,,,,,
,713,I Appreciate The Sunday Was Mothering Sunday And You Had A Private Function And That I Suspect You May Have Started To Fill Up In The Grill But Hardly Anyone Had Arrived By 12:45 When We Left. The Grill Was Almost Empty Bar Perhaps One Table. We Had Wanted To Take Lunch And Then Go Back To The Airport But With So Many People Arriving As Were Advised And The Staff Seeming Very Distracted We Decided It Might Make Turning Around Even A Roast Main Course Difficult By 2Pm. Whilst We Did Eat In The Alcove And It Was Nice Food In Fairness We Did Get The Feeling We Were A Little Bit Surplus To Requirements Given The Inability To Eat In The Oak Room And The Problem With The Limo Booking That May Have Made Us Unpopular. I Felt That It Would Have Been Better All Around From The Staff Perspective If We Had Left Soonest After Settling Our Bill And So Were Out Of The Way.,,,,,
,715,Everything Was Great Except For The Long Waiting Times In The Restaurants And The Fact That We Had To Repeatedly Had To Ask For Things Before They Arrived.,,,,,
,717,Shame About The Artificial Flowers In The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,718,Service In The Bistro... It Felt Like The Management Of The Bistro Was Poor.  The Staff Were Fine.  Should Not Have To Wait 45 Minutes After Ordering For Food For The Kids When Half The Restaurant Is Empty.,,,,,
,721,A Better   Warmer Room For The Price With A Better Bathroom And Toiletries; Refurb The Edwardian Grill And Get Rid Of The Weird Sofas And Leaning Mirrors :); Retrain The Male Sommelier And Refund Some Of Our Wine For That Evening :),,,,,
,723,An Area/Room With Children's Movies Would Be Good For Rainy Days. Apart From This And The Small Points Mentioned We Had An Excellent Stay And Will Definitely Stay For Longer Next Time!,,,,,
,729,Improve The Breakfast Experience In The Hotel.  Although We Didn't Eat Dinner In The Edwardian Restaurant It Makes Me Doubt How Good The Dinner Would Be  Because Of The Breakfast Quality.,,,,,
,732,Some Issues With Cleanliness And Starchy Edwardian Grill Staff,,,,,
,740,The Staff  On The Whole  Were Excellent.  However  The Fire Alarm Went Off Early Evening  My Wife Went Into The Coridor Outside The Room  With Our 4 Month Old Baby Wrapped In A Towel (Post Bath)  Unsure Of Where To Go And What To Do  And Was Ignored By A Member Of Staff.,,,,,
,741,The Little Things - This Is Intended To Help - The Wrong Paper Was Delivered - No Butter With Breakfast - Not Enough Cream With Afternoon Tea (More Sent Very Quickly) - Chocolate Cake With Afternoon Tea Was Far From Best Before - Sent It Back But This Was Not Removed From The Bill - All Staff Very Friendly And Smart,,,,,
,742,Include Extras With Room Given Price,,,,,
,744,Not Very Much Really!  I Just Have Some Small Suggestions: 1) The Tv In Kitty Jay Could Do With Replacing - Its A Bit Small For The Room  Has Bad Reception And No Sound On Bbc2! 2) An Ipod Docking Station Would Be Useful  Or Even A Cable Attached To The Existing Cd/Radio. 3) I've Noted This Before  But I'm Surprised Wifi Is Charged And The 2 Device Limit Is A Little Optimistic Between 7 Guests In A Lodge,,,,,
,755,In Spite Of Exceeeding Expectations  Next Time I Woudl Request A Brighter Room And Ideally One That Was A Bit More Upgraded As To Standards,,,,,
,756,Great Experience - It Was Expensive And Having Paid The Bill - You Do Start To Question If It Was Worth It - Overall Yet - But The Price Would Restrict Me In Coming Back Again Soon - Price Makes It A Bit Once In While  Special Event Only For Most People Id Think.,,,,,
,759,The Dinner In The Elegant Restaurant Should Be The Highlight Of A Wonderful Day  But It Wasn't. We Want To Be 'Wowed' With The Food  But It Was  In Our Opinion  Unimaginative And Old Fashioned. ,,,,,
,760,One Single Service Charge Rather Than On Every Individual Item.,,,,,
,762,It Is Not Appropriate To Add Service Charges When This Has Not Been Agreed With The Patron.,,,,,
,770,Everyone Was Delightful. John Who Showed Us Around  To The Falconry Man And His Birds! Frederico And Louise Too,,,,,
,773,No  It Was A Very Pleasant Stay And A Very Good Price.  ,,,,,
,774,#Name?,,,,,
,777,We Had A Great Stay And You Were All Extremely Helpful.  Champagne And Spa Treatment Was Very Much Appreciated As Was The Late Check-Out.  Many Thanks.,,,,,
,779,Yes  I Have Severe Allergy To Dogs And They Were In Eating Areas  I Had Afternoon Tea Which End Up Very  Sick In My Room Due To Allergy. Also Dogs Were Off Leash Inside The Main Building Even On First Floor. I Like To Know Whether You Have A Specific Rooms For Your Guests Who Like To Have Their Dogs With Them.  How Do You Deal With Making The Rooms Allergy Proof For Guests Like Me.,,,,,
,787,The Organisation In The Kitchen At Breakfast Needs Attention. We Waited At Least 20 Min For Tea And Coffee Both Mornings. Waiters Are Running Around And Do Their Best But You Could Do With Some Tighter Management In The Morning.,,,,,
,789,A Better Internet Service Would Be Really Helpful And Is The Only Reason I Would Question Staying Again. With No Cell Phone Inet Coverage Is Even More Important.,,,,,
,791,I Believe That The Food Could Have Been Improved. All The Meals That We Had Were In General Overcooked And Felt That Although The Choice Of Food And The Quality Were Good The Final Cooking Of The Meals Need To Be Looked At.,,,,,
,795,The Dining Options Are Limited Because The Bistro Food Is Terrible And It's Atmosphere Is Appealing. The Main Dining Room Is Lovely But Needs The Warmth Of Music (Jazz  Not Barry Manilow!). The Food Is Also Inconsistent.,,,,,
,796,Thought The Discretionary Charge Was Excessive And Should Be Opted In Rather Than Opt Out.,,,,,
,797,I Think That Whilst The Staff Were Attentive The Main Thing That Was Lacking Was Attention To Detail. Some Members Of Staff Were Very Prfessional And Couldn't Do Enough To Help. Whilst Other Simply Forgot About Our Request Or Even Forgot About Us!,,,,,
,800,No,,,,,
,801,The Waiters In The Restaurants Lacked Training. One In Particular Would Have A Habit Of Taking The Milk Jug Away Before We Had Served Our Tea. The Orders Were Frequently Wrong And Subsequently We Would Have To Check The Breakfast Bill Carefully For Errors- Which Did Happen On Numerous Occasions.,,,,,
,802,The Final Bill Was A Problem.  The Line Items Were Organised In A Way That Was Very Hard To Figure Out.  None Of My Package Discounts Appeared On The Bill And All Had To Be Corrected.  I Was Told That Half Of My Dining Allowance Had Been Used For Something Else On Another Day.  When I Asked For Specifics It Took At Least 15 Minutes To Figure Out Where It Had Been Used.  I Still Don't Know If It Was Right And It Was Nearly Impossible To Figure Out.  Allowances Should Be Taken Off The Bottom Line Of The Bill In A Clean And Transparent Way.  I Walked Away Feeling As If I Had Been Deceived.,,,,,
,803,Signage To The Hotel Was Very Poor And We Had A Rather Anxious Journey Via North Bovey And Numerous Very Narrow Country Lanes In The Dark With Little Confidence We Were On The Right Track. I Understand The Limitations Of Being Within A National Park  But Perhaps When Booking Confirmations Are Sent This Should Be Pointed Out  I.E. Not To Route Via North Bovey  But Via Moretonhampstead  For Example.,,,,,
,804,We Missed Hearing The Pianist! Mattress Needs Replacing In Jaystone (Top Floor)  & The Bedside Chest Of Drawers Has Chips In The Glass Which Is Dangerous. Tv In That Bedroom Gets Very Poor Reception So Unwatchable.,,,,,
,807,You Say Discretionary Service Charge But It Was Automatically Added To The Bill,,,,,
,809,You Should Have Someone Give A Tour Of The Castle  Mention All Of The Activities And How To Sign Up For Them.  We Were Shown To Our Accomodations And Then Left To Fend.,,,,,
,811,We Were Just Disappointed With The Overall Standard Of Decor  The Overall Impression Was Shabby  However All The Staff We Encountered Were Extremely Helpful Polite And Friendly.,,,,,
,812,Just Improve The Grill  Staff And Ambience !,,,,,
,813,The Bill Was Wrong And The Service Charge Was Automatically On The Bill Which I Missed. I Would Not Have Paid It Had I Noticed It. Also It Is Awkward To Ask To Have The Service Charge Taken Off. I Feel Disappointed About This And A Little Cheated Particularly As My Wife Had A Bad Experience With Her Nail Treatment,,,,,
,816,Refer To Previous Comments,,,,,
,819,On Departure  When The Account Was Closed From A Room Account  To Day Account  In My Name  The Handover Appeared Clumsy  And It Was A Bit Of A Mess Being Charged Accurately For Final Day Drinks Etc,,,,,
,824,More Staff Needed  Adequately Trained!,,,,,
,825,Resolve Poor Staff In The Bistro,,,,,
,829,Better Weather !!! Really Enjoyed The Wine Tasting On A Previous Visit,,,,,
,830,Explain The Excess Charges In Relation To The Dinner Element At The Time Of Booking. When Paying This Cost To Stay And Dine At Bovey The Staff Could At Least Pick Up The Discarded Door Handle Which Is On The Floor When You Look Out The Window Of The Dining Room At The Furthest End From The Dining Room Entrance. The View Of The Screening From This Table Is Not Good But It Takes Seconds To Pick Up Items Like This,,,,,
,831,I Dont Agree With The Service Charge. We Had Pay For Dinner Within Our Package And Already Had 10`% Added. We Then Had A % Added For The Bistro. We Were Not Given Any Choice Over It And It Is Embarrasing To Spoil The Has Been A Nice Couple Of Days Taking Issue Over Things On A Bill I Didn't Expect To See Or Expect To Pay,,,,,
,832,When I Book A Specific Room - Please Do Not Move Me To Another Room!,,,,,
,833,Make It Booking Only For Tennis.  We Had Trouble Using The Courts As They Were Often Hogged By Whole Families For Hours On End!,,,,,
,835,The Discretionary Charges Were Initially A Bit Of A Surprise  But Your Terms And Conditions Do Mention Them And I Understand You Want To Be Fair To All Staff  But They Would Make Me Think Twice About What I Ordered And Where In The Hotel If I Stay Again. ,,,,,
,836,Just Those Couple Of 'Minor Niggles' With The Food Which Seemed A Shame Given That Everything Seemed To Be Such A High Standard.,,,,,
,839,Bovey Is Quite Expensive But I Have No Problem With This If I Get What I Pay For. As Mentioned Earlier The 1St Bedroom Was Disappointing As Was The Edwardian Grill. I Also Think The 5% Room Service Charge Is Unreasonable Given The Service You Get In Relation To Your Room Should Be Part Of The Room Rate. There Are Also Some Ridiculous Charges For Room Service Such As Â£14 For 2 Scones !,,,,,
,840,Better Room And Also The Ability To Reduce Discretionary  Charge  We Didnt Really Feel Able To Do This Without It Becoming Very Public ..,,,,,
,841,Unfortunately The Service At Breakfast On The Morning Of Departure Was Very Poor. If It Wasn't For The Falconry Display It Would Have Been Sad To Leave On A Down Note.,,,,,
,846,Map Of Corridors / Way Out,,,,,
,849,Fix The Dry Sauna And The Pool Temperature Could Be Warmer.  We Had Stayed At The Redcliff Hotel And The Pool Water Was Like Bath Water Temperature. Wonderful Stay!,,,,,
,850,I Would Like To Have Had The Descretionary Element Of The Bill Made Clearer,,,,,
,852,Provide A Clean And Well-Maintained Facility.  You Charge 5 Star Rates And Have A 5 Star Setting - But The Cleanliness And Maintenance Are 3 Star,,,,,
,857,The Lack Of Mobile Phone Coverage Is A Problem At The Hotel. The Booster In The Bistro Does Not Solve The Problem. The Bistro Is Too Busy And Noisy For Phone Calls. The Booster In The Library Does Not Help Either Because People Go To There To Relax And Should Not Be Bothered With Other Peoples' Phone Calls. There Should Be Designated Mobile Phone Areas Outside The Lounges And Restaurants Or Mobile Phone Booths That Offer Sufficient Coverage And Privacy!,,,,,
,859,No,,,,,
,860,Would Have Been Nice To Be Able To Order Drinks From A Waiter In The Sun-Bathing Area Outside The Pool.,,,,,
,862,We Were Wedding Guests. I Think The Tv Should Have Been Working But We Didn't Want To Make A Fuss So Didn't Call Anyone. The Wedding Meal Was Very Good (Perhaps With The Exception Of The Main Course) But Service Of The Canapes And Drinks At The Evening Function Was Poor,,,,,
,864,We Would Have Liked Our Afternoon Tea By The Fire When We Arrived But We Were Told They Were All Booked.  However During The Time It Took Us To Have Our Tea No-One Arrived. That Was A Shame.,,,,,
,865,I Would Prefer To Pay An Inclusive Price,,,,,
,875,Have Functioning Televisions In The Rooms.    We Have High Expectations Based On Previous Experiences And All Met.  Thank You.,,,,,
,884,As Previously Mentioned We Have Stayed With You Before And Were So Looking Forward To The 'Bovey Castle Experience' Again.However We Were Disappointed As We Were Unable To Use The Facilities The Following Day  We Had Planned To Use The Swimming Pool And Then Relax In One Of Your Lounges Enjoying An Afternoon Tea In Front Of The Fire Before Making Our Journey Home  Which We Had Enjoyed On Our Previous Visit.,,,,,
,886,It Would Be Easier If Guests Received A Duplicate Copy Every Time They Signed For Something As Trying To Determine If Account Was Correct Was Very Difficult. Also  Hte Service Charge Was Not Totalled On The Account. We Had To Ask What The Total Was.,,,,,
,887,We Enjoyed Our Stay And We Appreciate That Staff Wwere Occupied With The Wedding  But There Seemed To Be A Shortage Of Staff And Several Could Not Fully Understand English When A Request Was Made - Waiter At The Bistro And The Room Maid.,,,,,
,888,Families And Children Seem To Be A Large Client Segment For The Hotel. Our Expectation Was A More Organized Approach To Bovey Rangers Rather Than It Being A Schedule Of Disparate Activities. My Sense Is That You Can Afford To Charge More For A Full Day Bovey Ranger Counselor(S) Which Would Enhance Much More The Parents And Children's Experience At Your Establishment. For This Reason Alone  We'd Return To Bovey Castle. Without This  We'd Likely Try Some Place Else.,,,,,
,889,Great All Round.  Very Good Staff.  Just Free Internet Access Should Be Part Of The Offer.,,,,,
,893,Not That I Can Think Of.,,,,,
,896,See Earlier Comments,,,,,
,898,I Realize You're At Work Creating The Wine Cellar But A Tasting In A Guest Suite Is Not The Experience Expected  Quite A Different Ambience... And The Sommelier Is In Need Of A Good Suit.,,,,,
,902,Fix The Leaks In The Main Hall?,,,,,
,904,Actually No  Other Than My Comment Above Re Free Wifi  But At Least You Stopped Me Ignoring My Husband In Favour Of My Ipad....! I Was Impressed At All The Things You Had On Offer - The Falconry  The Walks  The Ferrets (Which We Didn't See  Because We Ran Out Of Time)  The Wellies And Barbours  The Handmade Biscuits And Fudge In The Room - Even If We Were Given The Fudge On The First Night Only! Etc - You Seemed To Have Thought Of Everything.,,,,,
,906,More Information About Walking On Dartmoor. Other Than Main Restaurant Which Was A Big Disappointment Visit Was Excellent.,,,,,
,907,No,,,,,
,908,Shower Screen Leaked - Had To Mop The Floor After Each Shower.,,,,,
,914,My Answer To 22 Is Perhaps A Little Harsh But Overall I Had Slightly Higher Expectations Of Teh Restaurant  Particularly In Terms Of Changes To Menus Etc.  I Also Found Part Of Teh Experience Slightly Impersonal.  Again That Might Seem A Little Harsh As Various Individuals I Thought Did Very Well  But Overall It Felt A Bit Like Being An Anonymous Person Staying In A Very Large Hotel With A Lot Of Guests  With Not Great Breakfasts  Unchanging Menus For Lunch And Dinner And Feeling Slightly Disgruntled At Being Asked To Pay Extra For Internet Access And Breakfasts,,,,,
,919,Golf Pros Need To Be Polite  To Say 'Can I Help You' When Someone (Myself And 16Y Son) Comes To Ask What To Do/Where To Go At The Start Of A Pre Booked Tee Time. It Felt As If We Were A Slight Annoyance On A Day When  There Were Very Few Golfers On The Course. This Was Very Different To The Enthusiasm And Kindness Shown By The Rest Of The Bovey Castle Team.,,,,,
,920,Improve The Mobile Phone Issue Improve The Atmosphere And Food In The Bistro.,,,,,
,923,We've Never Been Charged For A Newspaper At Any Hotel And  Particularly When This Is Billed As A Five Star Hotel  We Really Thought That Was Petty.,,,,,
,924,Breakfast Was Not Explained Very Well On Day 1 But Was Explained Much Better On Day 2.,,,,,
,925,I Am Afraid The Stay Was Overpriced  Also The Cost Was Quoted But I Was Never Advised That It Was Per Vat And Was Somewhat Shocked At An Additional Â£120 Added To What Was Already An Overpriced Stay,,,,,
,927,Better Changing Facilities At The Pool - Changing Room Very Cramped  Little Space To Store Belongings  No Seating/Privacy. Only A Small Point  But An Item Of Lost Property That Had Apparently Been Passed On To Reception  When We Asked For It On Leaving  Had Disappeared. Reception Called Housekeeping Who Said They Didn't Have It - No Further Effort Was Made To Find It.,,,,,
,933,The Cheese And Ham At The Breakfast Buffet Were Not Great - But The Truly Fresh Orange Juice Was Great.,,,,,
,938,Met The Manager Just To Say Hello And Be Friendly.  It Would Be Good If You Could Send An Email Acknowledgement Of A Person's Booking.  I Realised I Didn't Have Any Written Acknowledgement Of My Phone Booking So After A Few Weeks I Rang And Asked For One.  Also  We Were Staying At A Lodge For The First Time And It Would Have Been Good To Have Received Some Details Of What It Contained.  I Had To Email To Ask If It Had A Dvd Player  For Example.  We Find The 'Discretionary' Service Charge Very Annoying And Don't Come Across It At Other Top Hotels.,,,,,
,939,My Father-In-Law Had Contacted The Hotel Twice To State He Was Payng For Our Stay.  He Had Also Given Credit Card Details But We Still Had To Pay For Our Own Bill On Departure.  This Was Most Unfortunate And Extremely Disappointing For Him As He Had Wanted To 'Treat' Us. The Hotel Had Assured Him That We Would Not Have To Pay.,,,,,
,946,Please Can Staff Have Some Clear Directions That They Can Use To Refer To If They Are Not Familiar With The Area Themselves Or Not Good At Providing Directions.   There Was No Sommelier Which Was A Shame.,,,,,
,947,Priced As A Luxury Hotel But Looked Tired.,,,,,
,948,I Understand That Bovey Is A Family Hotel But Breakfast Time Was Very Noisy And A Little Chaotic With Children Running In And Out Pass Our Table And Perhaps There Should Be Age Restriction Or Well Behaved Children .,,,,,
,954,Stopped It Raining! . . .  Only Joking :-),,,,,
,955,Beds Could Be Better,,,,,
,960,I Think For The Price Paid At Your Hotel  The Final Account Should Be Accurate  Avoiding The Embarrassment Of Having To Discuss The Details At Reception.,,,,,
,962,We Enjoyed Staying At Bovey Castle As On Previous Stays  But We Made It Clear That The Occasion Was Our 30Th Wedding Anniversary  But No Mention Of This Was Made Whatsoever  Which Was A Little Disappointing.,,,,,
,969,This Visit Was Not As Good As The Last Visit As The Rooms Are Getting Tired  Scratched  Scuffed And Stained. Obvious Cost Cutting Has Taken Place In The Last 2 Years And It Shows.,,,,,
,971,Was Not Made Aware It Was A Discretionary Service Charge  It Just Said Service Charge.  We Will Make Sure On Our Next Stay To Not Pay It As Especially This Time We Did Not Think The Restaurant Met The Service We Had Expected.,,,,,
,975,Breakfast Was Fine  But Compare To The Breakfasts In Germany In Luxary Hotels  It Was Not Really Good.,,,,,
,978,Morning Coffee Was Luke Warm And Had To Be Replaced No Milk In Room For Morning Tea (Fridge Missing) Additional Coffee Requested At Breakfast Never Turned Up,,,,,
,983,Service Charges On Bill For Every Single Item Was A Bit Annoying.,,,,,
,985,More Expertise - Plenty Of Young Staff But Felt More Training Required,,,,,
,987,The Breakfast Was Very Variable--I Have Never Ordered Poached Eggs And Had One Delivered Broken---The Bacon Had Clearly Been Left Under Some Form Of Warmer So Was Tough And Unappetising.Following Day Went For Eggs Benedict ---The Muffin Was Rock Hard.Think The Breakfast Was Not Good---It Put Us Off Having A Dinner.Also On The Saturday Night We Went To The Piano Bar.Small Children Were Still Up And In My Opinion They Should Not Be Allowed In A Bar Area And I Saw At Least Two Sets Of Guests Go To Sit Down But Then Leave Because Of The Noise And Disruption These Children Were Producing.,,,,,
,990,Except For The Spa Experience We Had A Great Break.  We Particularly Enjoyed The Birds And The Walks.,,,,,
,991,Changed Some Of The Art Work  Do Not Really Want To See Dirty Dishes On The Floor Outside A Room When Walking Along The Rather Grubby Corridor  Did Not Like The Wall From Outside The Pool To The Spa Which Needs Help - It Took Away All Feeling Of Glamour And Luxury,,,,,
,995,Not Consistant For Example No Petit Fours Or Olives With Drinks On Sunday,,,,,
,997,No,,,,,
,998,You Could Have Had A Wee Word With The Weather Gods.  Notwithstanding The Rain And Wind We Truly Did Have A Splendid Time.,,,,,
,999,Excellent.,,,,,
,1000,I Felt The Standard Of Bedrooms   Restricted Menu Choice And Poor Bistro Service And Facilities Were Some Way Short Of Your Aspiration And Price Point And The Experience You Advertise. I Had Stayed At The Hotel When It Was The Manor And Frankly The Change Doesn't Support The Price,,,,,
,1001,There Was At Times A Charming Lack Of Order Which Was Acceptable In The Circumstances.,,,,,
,1002,Better Mobile Signal Or Specific Advice As To Where In Hotel Best Signal Could Be Obtained. Not That I Wanted To Be On My Mobile All The Time As I Didn't.,,,,,
,1004,The Hotel Is Lovely ; Elegant Yet Relaxed And Comfortable.  We Would Happily Return. We Were There For My Husband's Birthday And It Would Have Been Nice If That Had Been Acknowledged- Just A 'Happy Birthday' From Someone.   We Enjoyed Some On The Local Walks And The Falconry Display. We Would Not Use The Spa Or The Bistro Again.,,,,,
,1006,Get A New Chef And Train Your Restaurant Waiters (Although The Woman Who Was The Maitre D' Seemed Very On The Ball But She Didn't Introduce Herself So I Don't Know Her Name.),,,,,
,1007,Unfortunately  My Job Is In The Travel Industry And I Stay At 5* Hotels Throughout The World Regularly.   So When I Am Traveling I Have A Pretty High Bar For Places That Are Presented As Luxurious And I Did Not Think That The Accommodations Were Anywhere Close To Luxurious.  I Think That They Were Nice For What They Were  But There Were Too Many Things That Just Didn't Add Up.  Rather Than Send You An Endless List Of What Didn't Work  Which Would Not Be Helpful - How About I Just Recommend That You Figure Out A Way To Make The Toilet Flush In Room 33.   Having To Try Up To 15 Times Just To Make It Flush Just Doesn't Pass The 'Luxury' Test.,,,,,
,1008,Not Really,,,,,
,1009,Dining Experience Fell Below 5 Star Expectations. This Break Was Booked As A Suprise 60Th Birthday Treat For Me  However Despite My Husband Advising You At The Time Of Booking  No Reference To This Was Made During Our Stay With You.,,,,,
,1010,I'm Not Sure Letting Us Know Its Optional And Yet Asking If It Is Ok All The Time Is The Most Comfortable Way For Guests.  I Would Prefer The Approach Of Advising Us The Staff Will Not Accept Any Tips Because A Service Fee Is Included In The Charge And Encouraging The Staff To Be Very Customer Focussed.  I May Be On My Own Here.,,,,,
,1014,Erroneous Billings To My Account  Which Have Still Not Resolved After One Week.,,,,,
,1016,Dinning Experience & Bar Service Very Much Lacking.,,,,,
,1021,Earlier Comments Re Service Charge - We Were Surprised And It Was Not Discussed Re Options.  The Bill Was Confusing And Incorrect And Did Give Us A Bit Of Anxiety At First But The Girls Were Very Good At Unravelling.  Altogether The Maitre De In The Restaurant Wasn't Very Interested In Advising Us On What Our Costs On Our Spa Break Included,,,,,
,1025,No  Everything Was Perfect.,,,,,
,1027,Let Us Know When Our Room Was Ready  We Arrived At 11.00Am And Told They Won Dlet Us Know When Room Ready. Went To A One Of The Lodges Where Our Friends Were Staying And Rang To Say We Would Be There When Room Ready. Waited Until 2Pm  No Telephone Call  So My Friend And I Went To Reception To Find Out If We Could Access Our Rooms. Were Then Told It Was Ready.,,,,,
,1030,Please Review My Comments!  I Paid The Discretionary Charge Out Of Goodwill But Feel That It Really Was Not Justified On This Occasion And By Then I Was Really So Unimpressed And Didn't Want To Have Another Conversation About The Overall Poor Experience Of The Stay.  Such A Shame - I Feel That You Need To Live Up To Your Advertising Of Luxury And Attention To Detail.  At The Moment You Do Not. I Also Updated My Address For You This Morning When I Paid The Account - Guess What?  The Receipt I Was Given Did Not Reflect This.  Such Poor Attention To Detail Really Does Let You Down Once Again.,,,,,
,1031,The Experience Should Be As Described On The Website.  In Both Accomodation And  More Seriously  Food It Fell Below The Standard Offered On The Site.,,,,,
,1032,Some Current Magazines Would Have Been Appreciated In The Lounges Rather Than The Same Three Freebies Distributed Throughout,,,,,
,1035,Breakfast Was Very Good. The Croissants Were Superb! The ' Discretionary' Charge Added To Our Final Bill Was Never Explained To Us And Therefore Was Hardly Discretionary. We Paid It But In Fact Did Not Feel That We Would Necessarily Have Rewarded The Level Of Service We Received.,,,,,
,1036,Plates For Hot Food At Breakfast Were Cold.,,,,,
,1039,It Was The Delay Between Asking For Drinks Or All The Food Arriving That Seemed At Odds With The Costs,,,,,
,1040,Better Training And Organisation Of Breakfast Staff.  Cooler Bedrooms Please!,,,,,
,1041,No,,,,,
,1042,Sort The Dining Experience Out - You Expect To Be Having Excellent Service For The Amount Of Money You Pay. It's A Shame Because Recommending Bovey To Friends Is Done With Hesitation. Trip Advisor Is A Good One To Read. Go To Gidley Park And See How It Should Be Done.,,,,,
,1043,Wine Was Not The One Selected But I Hadn't Noticed Until Poured - No Check Back So I Have No Idea What We Paid For. As The Above Explains You Did Not Meet Our Expectation Of A 5* Hotel.,,,,,
,1046,We Were In Room 37  Small And At The Back Looking Over The Car Park .We Had To Boil The Kettle On The Floor Behind The Tv !,,,,,
,1047,No,,,,,
,1049,Just Improve The Food.  Move The Large Extractor Fan Which Was Opposite Our Bedroom Window And Was Continuously Working All Night. Paying The Money That You Ask For The Rooms We Would Expect It To Be Much Quieter Especially As The Location Of The Hotel Is In Such A Quiet And Picturesque Place.,,,,,
,1051,Departure Would Have Been Made Easier If Everything That Was To Be Collected From The Wedding Reception Had Been To Hand - As It Was We Were Kept Waiting Quite A While Whilst Several 'Missing' Objects Were Located.,,,,,
,1052,Disabled Access Is Sub-Optimal.  Staff Were Helpful During Reception On The Terrace But Later When Main Door Access Was Needed  We Had To Manoeuvre The Ramp Each Time We Entered Or Left The Main Building,,,,,
,1053,Apart From Stop The Rain The Stay Was Agreeable But The Bacon At Breakfast Was Tough Both Mornings And The Lamb We Had On Saturday Night At Dinner Was Too Tough For The Knife. Either Get Sharper Knives Or More Tender Meat.,,,,,
,1055,No  The Experience Was Perfect.,,,,,
,1057,All Good Except Room,,,,,
,1061,The Hawk Man Did Not Turn Up On Saturday Morning Which Was Disappointing But Understandabe But It Would Have Been Nice If The Reception Team Had Actually Come Out To Tell Us  Instead It Was A Guest Who Had To Suggest They Did. Our Bar Bill Was Extortionate. That Was A Shock. We Could Not Have Afforded To Pay For 2 Rounds Of Drinks. Finally Having A Really Poor (Well Non Existent) Internet Access Package For The Guest Is Unheard Of In 2012.,,,,,
,1062,Get The Wifi To Work.,,,,,
,1064,Better Mattress More Reasonably Priced Drinks.,,,,,
,1070,Service  Eat,,,,,
,1071,The Allocation Of Charged Items To Our Room Was Somewhat Random. We Were Dining With Friends Who Stayed In Another Room. Even If We Gave Clear Instructions About Splitting Bills We Found That This Was Not Done. Luckily We Were Able To Fix Any Issues Prior To Checking Out With Help From Reception Staff.,,,,,
,1075,The Ability To Put The Heating On In Own Room - Both Room And Towel Rail,,,,,
,1078,Sort Out The Hairdryer  Banging Doors And Unlocked Doors.,,,,,
,1082,My Only Issue In The Whole Experience Was That I Tried To Convert Some Money From Dollars Into British Pounds Late One Evening After Returning From A Day Trip.  The Reception Desk Refused To Do It.  It Left Me In A Very Bad Way  Because I Was Leaving The Next Morning On A Bus Trip For The Day At 5Am.  I Thus Had No Cash To Use The Next Day.  I Thus Had To Solicit A Fellow Traveler To Change Enough Money For Me To Have A Little Cash For The Next Day.  The Front Desk Refused To Even Exchange $20 For Me!  So That I Would At Least Have 10 Pounds The Next Day.   Surely Some Kind Of Provisions Could Be Made To Help Meet Travelers' Needs Better Than That.  Other Than That  My Stay There Was Awesome!,,,,,
,1083,No.,,,,,
,1085,It Took Some Time To Work Out The Bill Due To The Way Items Were Recorded.  For Example  Afternoon Cream Tea Was Recorded As A Lunch  Coffee Was Recorded As Oak Room Dinner Food! Could The Itemised Bill Be More Accurate?,,,,,
,1086,I Think Some Of The Staff Uniforms Should Have Been Cleaned As Many Of Them Were Stained - Especially The Jacket Of The Bar Manager.,,,,,
,1088,Breakfast Service Was Very Hit And Miss. Particularly On The Saturday Morning Of Our Stay. A Lot Of Poeple Were Left Waiting For Drinks And Orders To Be Taken.,,,,,
,1089,Disappointed By The Service For Our Afternoon Tea In The Library  Felt Rather Forgotten About. We Had To Go And Find Staff Twice To Ask For Extra Hot Water And To Sign The Chit Afterwards. Service V Slow For Morning Coffee On Saturday.,,,,,
,1090,See Comments Above,,,,,
,1091,Faster Service From The Hotel Bar - Drinks Before Dinner Took Up To 25 Minutes To Be Served. Ensure That Customer Facing Staff (Bar And Restaurant) Have A Better Understanding And Command Of The English Language And Understand How To Speak To Guests In An Establishment Such As Bovey Castle. If A Request For Service Is Made  The Response Should Be 'I'll Be With You In A Moment Sir'  Rather Than The Brusque (East European?) 'One Moment'.  I Was Often Unsure Whether The Staff Had Understood What We Wanted To Order.,,,,,
,1093,On The Day We Arrived We Had A Warm Welcome From The Staff And The Lounges Were Warm And We Enjoyed Relaxing There  So We Looked Forward To Spending The Next Day At The Hotel. However The Following Day The Lounges Were Cold With No Fires Burning And As Our Room Was Uninviting We Sought Warmth In Th Bistro With A Warm Drink.  Sadly We Left At 11.30Am To Go Home Very Disappointed.,,,,,
,1094,Do Not Put Service Charge On Everything!,,,,,
,1095,Would Have Preferred To Be Asked Asked If I Would Like My Car Valet Parked.   Please See Below.,,,,,
,1096,We Had Coffee On Arrival And Again With Breakfast.  We Both Felt It Was Of Poor Quality: Very Much Like Perculated Coffee That Had Been Left On The Heater Too Long!,,,,,
,1098,The Hotels Housekeeping Check On Room Maintainance Needs To Be Improved. Similarly If Guests Have Genuine Cause For Complaint The Situation Should Be Addressed By The Hotel Manager Appearing In Personal At  The Outset Rather Than Following A Second Complaint.,,,,,
,1099,More Signage From Moretonhampsted And  Indeed Approaching It Would Have Made Our Arrival Easier.,,,,,
,1101,Not To Automatically Add A Serive Charge. With No Mobile Connection It Seems Unfair To Charge For Phone Calls,,,,,
,1102,Warm The Bedrooms Up A Bit  Add Some Veg To The Main Courses And Improve The Decor In The Bistro. The Public Rooms Are Very Cosy And Comfortable But The Bistro Is A Little Austere And Bleak.,,,,,
,1104,Car Windscreen Wash Or Even A Car Wash Service On Offer Would Be An Idea.  Radio 4 Would Have Esp. Pleased My Husband But Unavailable Through The Tv. O/S Maps Of The Area Available To Buy/Rent?,,,,,
,1105,No,,,,,
,1106,The Service During Afternoon Tea Was Very Poor  We Were Taken To Our Table But Then Waited 20Mins And Then My Husband Had To Find Someone To Take Our Order  We Also Wanted Some More Milk And Again Had To Go And Find Someone. Another Guest Also Told The Waiter He Was Less Than Attentive And He Also Had To Find Someone For Service  Not Really What One Would Expect In A 5Star Hotel.,,,,,
,1107,I Think From What I Can See The Classification Of Your Rooms Into Your Categories  Can Use Some Work  As The Rating And Price Difference Did Not See To Be As Clear As Most Hotels. Room Sizes  Views  Quality Did Not Seem To Match With The Differences In Pricing And Made Things More Difficult.,,,,,
,1108,Better Rooms,,,,,
,1111,Slightly Disappointed On Return To Bedroom At 10:00 Am After Breakfast To Find The Chambermaid Had Commenced Cleaning The Room Before We Had Checked Out! Towels Had Been Removed Which Was A Little Inconvenient For Cleaning Teeth/Freshening Up Before Departure.,,,,,
,1115,No  I Only Felt That I Would Have Liked To Spend More Than One Night There To Fully Appreciate The Many Facilities You Have To Offer.,,,,,
,1119,You Really Need To Sort Out Your Internet  Phone And Television Connections. We Paid For Internet Connection But Were Hardly Able To Use It. It Is Very Important For People To Be Able To Use The Internet. Also The Television Never Worked Properly It Kept On Stopping And Freezing. This Is An Important Factor That Needs Sorting Out.,,,,,
,1120,Better Bedside Lights  Sufficient To Read By!,,,,,
,1122,The Service In The Bar And When We Asked For Afternoon Tea Was Dreadful. We Gave Up Waiting For Our Tea And Drinks To Arrive. My Daughter Had Dinner On The Saturday Night And It Took 3 Hours For The Food To Arrive And Complete Dinner. Appalling.,,,,,
,1123,If You Wish To Cancel Falconry  Please Do Not Send Notification That This Will In Fact Be Due In Writing The Very Night Before This Is Due. We Were Very Tired After Long Journey  But Made Effort To Take Early Breakfast To Be There Only To Discover That Thid Was Cancelled  As Not Enough Guests Available.,,,,,
,1124,No,,,,,
,1126,Improve The Service In The Edwardian Grill & Bar,,,,,
,1128,We Felt That There Could Have Been A Better Exploitation Ogf The Pride Of Britain Connection. For Example When I Take My Car In For A Service  I Am Always Given A Better Car Than Mine To Use. So Instead Of The Room We Had Looking Out Onto A Stone Wall  With A Less Than Full Occupation  Why Not Let Usa Room With A View Of The Surrounding Countryside? This Is Intended To Be A Constriuctive Comment.,,,,,
,1129,My Whole Family Enjoyed All Their Activities & The Tuition Given Was Good & The Balloon Team Were Excellent. Our Two Days With You Will Always Bring Back Happy Memories. Thankyou.,,,,,
,1131,I Think It Could Have Enhanced Our Stay If Someone Sat Down With Us To Discuss All The Options And Suggestions Regarding Sightseeing In The Area. In Retrospect It Would Have Been Nice To Visit The Coast And Perhaps Other Spots In Dartmoor - For Instance I Understand War Horse Was Filmed There - May Have Been Nice To Learn More About That - Did They Use One Of The Nearby Towns For Instance In Filming - What Parts Of The Moors Were In The Film?,,,,,
,1133,Restaurant Bills Were Difficult To Follow,,,,,
,1134,Firstly  The Bill Was Wrong - We Were Charged Twice For Our Dinner Beverages.,,,,,
,1137,Provide Better Directions To The Gates.  Lack Of Signs Cost Us A Lot Of Time; The One Sign In Mortonhampstead Was Misleading.,,,,,
,1139,A Gesture To Apologise For The Poor Serving Of Mussels In The Restaurant  See Above.,,,,,
,1142,The Final Account Was Correct But Gave Insufficient Detail  (Needed More Itemisation).,,,,,
,1147,More Newspapers One Daily Mail Was Not Enough ,,,,,
,1148,At Breakfast It Looked Mean To Have Only One Platter Of Butter  Jam And Marmalade On A Table For 10 People - We Constantly Had To Ask For More.  Also No Spoons Were Provided For The Preserves.  The Service Of Tea And Coffee Was Often Slow.  On Day 1 The Cooked Items Seemed Cold In The Bain-Maries - Maybe They Should Have Been Lit Earlier.,,,,,
,1149,My Husband And I Were Staying At Bovey Castle For Our Daughter's Wedding And As Parents Of The Bride Were Led To Believe We Would Have A Room Upgrade.  We Were Disappointed With The Room As It Was Overlooking The Car Park And We Therefore Had To Keep The Room Curtains To That Side Closed Making The Room Dark And Hot.  We Had Hoped For As Room With A View Over The Lovely Countryside.,,,,,
,1153,Only Two Improvements Drinks Were Not Nearly Ready In The Adam Room At 7.00 Pm - The Time Arranged The Intervals Between Courses In The Private Dinner Were Too Long Even Allowing For Indivual Preparation And Exemplary Service.,,,,,
,1156,No.,,,,,
,1160,Warmer Weather.,,,,,
,1161,The Gym Could Do With An Update.,,,,,
,1162,The Service Of Tea And Coffee T Breakfast Is Very Slow.,,,,,
,1164,Some Staff Seemed To Be New And Settling In.  The Bar Person  For Example  Didn't Know What Kir Was And I Had To Explain.  Having Moved To Room 28 Our Newspaper Was Left At 29.  Our Face Flannel Was Removed (So We Took Yours).,,,,,
,1166,No - Unfortunately The Weather Was Not Brilliant,,,,,
,1169,We Were Very Satisfied - It Was My First Experience Of Self-Catering And Using Hotel Facilities And It All Worked Well. See The Earlier Box For Other Comments,,,,,
,1170,The Breakfast Was Very Good  But It Needed Maybe Some Soft Classical Music Or Similar As It Was Uncomfortably Quiet.  The Staff Were Rather Austere. Maybe Make Sure Also That You Have Worcester Sauce!,,,,,
,1173,Make The Bistro A Better Eating Place,,,,,
,1175,When We Arrived At 12.30Pm We Were Told Our Room Would Be Ready Very Soon. At 4.00Pm We Had To Chase It Up. On The Hottest Day Of The Year There Was Absolutely No Shade On The Terrace And My Request For Some Was Treated In The Negative.,,,,,
,1178,When The Concierge Transition Is Complete  I Expect All Will Be Close To Perfect. We Loved Our Stay!!!,,,,,
,1179,Have Better Trained Staff In The Bar And Dining Area.,,,,,
,1180,No,,,,,
,1182,Integrated Member's Discount Appeared To Apply To Room - Tho' Appears Wine At Dinner No Discounted Proportionately Despite A Note That It Would Be So - No Problem - Didn't Bother To Query This.,,,,,
,1184,Would Have Been Nice To Have More Info As What One Could Do In The Surrounding Areas For Those Who Like To Explore And Are History Buffs,,,,,
,1187,1Full English Breakfast Was Cold . It It Was Too Easy For A Few People To Monopolise All The Lounge Seating .Tables Were Reserved And No One Sat At Them For Hours.Not Enough Lounge Space .,,,,,
,1195,Persuade Some Staff To Stop Saying That They Are Doing Everything 'For You'!  This Is A Common Problem I Find  And Maybe It Does Not Bother Anyone Else.,,,,,
,1196,No,,,,,
,1201,The Greeting Experience: Taking Time To Understand If We Wanted To Be Shown Around And Where To Find Things Would Have Been Helpful. Asking Whether There Were Any Particular Things We Wanted To Do And So On. The Service In Both Restaurants Whilst Polite And Friendly Was Not The Best We Have Received; E.G. Having To Remind People At The Bistro About One Of Our Puddings Twice And It Arriving 15 Minutes After The Others. Having To Find Someone At The Edwardian Restaurant To Take Our Orders And So On. Small Things Perhaps But Which Make A Big Difference.,,,,,
,1202,Not Really  We Enjoyed Our Time Immensely.,,,,,
,1203,My Father Has Huge Difficulty Walking (Not Yet Got Portable Wheelchair).  The Long Distance From The Suitable 'Disabled' Room To Breakfast Was Very Difficult.  Would  Have Been Much Easier If Breakfast Has Also Been Available Inthe Bistro.,,,,,
,1205,Did Not Appreciate All The Service Charges On The Final Bill,,,,,
,1206,The Bar Staff Went 'Missing' At Crucial Times.  I Know You Were Busy With The Wedding But There Were Queues For Drinks And We Had To Ask More Than Once For Staff To Be Provided For Ther Bar Eg Prior To The Wedding Ceremony,,,,,
,1211,Employ More Staff In The Kitchen.,,,,,
,1212,The Lodge Was Overall Very Comfortable And Our Stay Was Enjoyable. Please Note The Following And Where Comments Relate To 6 Persons This Is For The Resort's Info Only Since There Were Only 2 Of Us Staying The Carpets Generally Very Stained Glass Numbers Were Not Sufficient For 6 I Did Not Check All The Crockery But Found Chipped Bowl Teapot /Kettle Was Not Large Enough For 6  Wisteria And Roses On The Balcony Require Cutting Back (Had Scissors/Secateurs Been Available I Would I Would Have Gladly Done Some Pruning For You) Bbq Was Not Operational Cushions Were Left Out In The Bad Weather Before Arrival  Were Wet And Had Been Subject To Bird Droppings Waste Disposal Unit Needs Attention Dishwasher Indicated Lack Of Salt And Rinse Aid (A Note Informing The Staff Was Left In The Kitchen Area),,,,,
,1215,Improve The Eating Experance Or You Are A Dead Duck!,,,,,
,1216,Make More Use Of Your Excellent Wine Cellar - Pre Dinner Wine Tasting With Mark And Genaro Maybe.,,,,,
,1218,Bisto Dining Was Not Brilliant,,,,,
,1227,We Enjoyed Our Stay Very Much And Will Return Soon To Rose Cottage And Will Also Stay In The Hotel At Some Point Also. To Make Any Comments Would Appear To Be Nit Picking And This Based On Our Overall Experience Would Seem Unfair So Just Two Points Which Did Not Spoil Our Experience In Any Way But Will Mention As The Question Has Been Asked. 1: We Had Coffee In The Hotel But Found It To Be Not That Hot Which We Mentioned And The Young Man Said He Would Happily Replace Them However We Had Consumed Them By This Time And Felt That It Was Such A Small Thing And We Were Having A Lovely Time So Left It At That.  2: The Curtain Missing In The Dining Room Of Rose Cottage Was A Bit Of A Mystery However  I Know It Was Being Attended To At The Time Of Our Departure.,,,,,
,1228,A Minor Point - Only One Robe In The Bathroom,,,,,
,1229,I Think The Hotel Should Upgrade Its Bedrooms To Match The Rates Paid. Apart From That  The Overall Experience Was Fantastic!,,,,,
,1230,I'd Rather Opt-In To The Service Charge Regimen Than Have To Opt-Out At Settlement  Some Of The Service Charges Are Unnecessary.,,,,,
,1233,We Booked 3 Nights Dinner  Bed And Breakfast. I Would Have Appreciated Knowing In Advance That The Menu Would Be The Same Each Night With No Specials.,,,,,
,1236,We Have Discussed This And Frankly Can Come Up With Nothing.  A Thoroughly Happy And Enjoyable Experience.  We Should Mention That The Falconry Display With Martin Each Morning Was Wonderful And Very In Keeping With The Setting And The Whole Ambience Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,1237,Service In The Lounges Was Non-Existent. When I Wanted Something I Had To Go And Ask Reception,,,,,
,1238,I Think The Idea Of Charging 5% For Service Is A Bad One. The Hotel Is A 5 Star  Premium Destination - Excellent Service Should Not Only Be Expected But Received Within The Remit Of It's Quality.The Rates Are High Enough. This Leaves 'Bad Taste In Mouth' And Is A Reason Not To Come Back.,,,,,
,1241,No  It Was All Absolutely Perfect. We Didn't Want To Leave!,,,,,
,1243,If The Room Had Of Been Slightly Bigger/ Swisher Interior Decor And The Bathroom More Opulent I Would Have Been Delighted As It Was I Was Very Happy With My Stay.,,,,,
,1245,Some Elements Agreed During The Planning Of Our Visit Were Not Carried Through And / Or Known To All Staff. Some Of The Waiting Staff In The Bistro Require Further Training And Motivation.,,,,,
,1246,Everything Was Perfect,,,,,
,1247,I Would Like To Be Able To Visit Again  So It Would Be Nice If You Could Let People Know Of Any Breaks You Offer Via Email. I Think In The Mornings The Place Got A Bit Noisy  But Apart From That I Don't Have Any Complaints. I Like Bovey Castle  I Was Contemplating Between Hartwell House And Bovey Castle For Our Honeymoon  And Picked Bovey Castle And I'm Glad I Made That Choice. However  In The Other Places Where We Had Stayed  Since They Knew It Was Our Honeymoon  Some Special Complimentary Services Were Arranged By The Hotel. It Would Have Been Nice If People At The Honeymoon Had Paid Some Attention To The Fact That We Were On A Honeymoon. But  That's A Minor Thing. Look Forward To Being Back Soon.,,,,,
,1248,It Would Be Nice To Have A Menu In The Cottage And Also The Take Away Menu. The Advert States Sofas In The Lounge There Is Only One Sofa It Could Do With 2 Sofas When There Are 4 Adults Staying.,,,,,
,1249,Was There A Table Tennis Table? If So  Information Re That Might Have Been Helpful.,,,,,
,1250,Improve The Quality Of The Food.,,,,,
,1251,No It Was One Of The Best Hotel Stays I Have Ever Experienced,,,,,
,1253,Improve The Weather!!,,,,,
,1255,There Was Some Maintenance Which Was Needed And Although The Initial Check Was Quickly And Politely Performed The Maintenance Itself Was Not Carried Out. This Was Not A Big Issue But It Is About The Only Thing That Wasn't Up To The Incredible Level Of Service Received Otherwise.,,,,,
,1258,See Notes Re Bistro Would Not Eat There Again Unless Vastly Improved,,,,,
,1260,Some Of The Members Of Your Staff Should Improve Their English (Our English Is Not Perfect  Either  As We Are Not Native Speakers  But We Are Guests - And It Is Different - But Your Staff Meet Mostly Native Speakers Ant It Might Irritate Them - If The Staff Do Not Understand And Do Not Speak Proper English).,,,,,
,1265,No,,,,,
,1267,More Information About The Local Area  Walks Etc,,,,,
,1270,More Toys In The Room For Our One Year Old To Play With,,,,,
,1271,I Have Indicated That The Discretionary Charge Was Not Known  We Did Pay Some Charges Although Some Charges Were Declined  This Is Due To The Fact That We Felt The Service Could Have Been Better In The Bar Area I.E. Having To Approach The Bar For Drinks & Again To Settle The Bill  Req Nuts With A Drink Etc. All Small Incidentals But Nonetheless Would Not Warrant A Service Charge Being Applied.   . I Do Feel That As The Charge Is Discretionary It Should Be A Charge That The Customers Volunteer To Add  Rather Than Ask Clients To Deduct Which Can Be Embarrassing And Is Somewhat An Assumption That Clients Will Pay.,,,,,
,1272,No - Only Comments I Have Are The Ones Made Previously Re. Spa  Which Could Not Have Been Rectified During Our Stay!,,,,,
,1281,The Party Was Really Really Excellent - But I Wished I Had Arranged To Drive Myself Home Instead Of Staying Overnight.,,,,,
,1282,No,,,,,
,1283,Tough To Improve On The Quality You Consistently Provide - Thank You,,,,,
,1286,Maybe Better Service In Bistro And Breakfast On Saturday Morning Service Slow As Quite Busy But Lots Of Staff So Should Not Have Been,,,,,
,1287,Not Sure Whether It Was A One Way Street In Or Out Of The Castle  Maybe A Sign At The Door.,,,,,
,1289,Nothing At All.,,,,,
,1294,A Better Menu For The Castle Bistro  And Better Weather Would Be The Only Things!,,,,,
,1295,Breakfast Staff Were Slow With Drinks And Eggs!!,,,,,
,1301,I Have Only Put Met As I Have Stayed With You Before So Knew What To Expect. Every Aspect Of The Service You Provide Is Excellent.,,,,,
,1303,Larger And Better Beds For Single Rooms. Easier Internet Connection And Quick Fixes For Problems. Staff Should Check Service Works From All Areas Of Hotel. All Amenities Offered Should Be Available I.E. Such As A Fridge.   Faster And More Attentive Service In Bistro  Particularly When Not Busy.,,,,,
,1304,No All Was Catered For By The Staff  Food And Ambiance.,,,,,
,1305,Minor Point - The Stairs To Our Room (58) At The Bistro End Of The Building Were Very Dark At The Top At Night Time  We Mentioned This During Our Visit.,,,,,
,1306,See Earler Comments,,,,,
,1308,A) Stayed Longer B) Had Better Weather,,,,,
,1309,Let Us Stay Longer!,,,,,
,1311,Have Menus For The Grill/Bistro Available In The Room (Or Tv Screen) Rather Than To Ask The Staff For One.,,,,,
,1312,The Breakfast Charges Were Included In The Room. I Agreed This With Reservations When I Booked It. I Knew The Location And What We Would Be Doing And Had To Have Breakfast Included.I Would Not Have Accepted The Reservation If This Had Not Been Agreed At The Time. Even Your Letter   Which I Failed To Read   Was Wrong   At It Should Just Have Been Confirming Our Agreement. When I Mentioned This On Saturday Morning At The First Opportunity   I Was Told By A Number Of Staff It Would Be Resolved. After Checking Numerous Times With Reception I Lost The Will To Live And You (Manager) Even Said You Would Resolve It And Did Not. When I Checked Out The Receptionist Said I Would Have To Pay And The Manager Would Ring Me The Next Day To Sort It Out   Still Not Heard Anything .,,,,,
,1313,Spa Booking,,,,,
,1314,A Quiter Room Could Have Been Provided On First Request. However After An Uncomfortable First Night  This Was Quickly Resolved By Frederico.,,,,,
,1316,The 'Discretionary' Service Charge Wasnt Not Explained To Me As Such,,,,,
,1317,Bar Service Could Have Been Quicker.,,,,,
,1319,Yes At That Price The Breakfast Should Be Included In The Day Rate.,,,,,
,1321,Dining At Bovey Is A Disappointment. Breakfast Is Shambolic  The Bistro Is Slow And Food Is Not Great  And The Restaurant Is Too Posh For Everyday And For Our Teenagers  So We Usually End Up Going To Local Pubs. Everything Else At Bovey Is Just Perfect!,,,,,
,1322,Short Of Ensuring We Won The Lottery That Week There Is Nothing More You Could Have Done To Make Our Stay Any Better,,,,,
,1323,Spa Booking - Would Have Made It A Perfect Weekend,,,,,
,1324,Stayed Longer,,,,,
,1328,No,,,,,
,1329,Breakfast To Be Included In The Room Price.,,,,,
,1333,We Were A Little Bit Diassapointed To See The Additional Service Charge  We Didn't Realise Until Reading This That It Was Discretionary. This Was Not Made At All Clear And Was Just Added On To Our Bill. In A Hotel The Standard Of Bovey Castle  Outstanding Service Should Be Expected And Not At An Additional Cost. Other Than That We Had A Fantastic Stay And Very Much Enjoyed Ourselves.,,,,,
,1334,No,,,,,
,1337,No,,,,,
,1341,Our Only Disappointment Was Our Meal. Our Stay With You For Our 3Rd Anniversary Was Absolutely Lovely!,,,,,
,1342,We Had Such An Amazing Time At Bovey That We Are Already Planning A Return Visit With Our Children  We Did Fly Fishing Which Was Fantastic  Mike Was Really Nice  The Whole Bovey Experience Was Amazing And I Have Already Told All My Friends!,,,,,
,1343,Service Charge Could Have Been Explained Prior To Being Shown To Room.,,,,,
,1346,No,,,,,
,1350,The Only Disappointment Was The Fact That The Christmas Trees Were Not Up. This Is Our Second Visit At This Time Of The Year And I Did Ask When Booking If The Castle Would Be Decorated This Weekend  And Was Informed That It Would Be. So We Will Be Back  As We Are Determined To See The Hotel In All Its Festive Glory!,,,,,
,1352,An Offered Upgrade Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,
,1353,Only With More Accessable Internet Connection,,,,,
,1356,I Say Met  Because We Know The Standard Already And It Exceeded Our Expectations On Our First Visit.,,,,,
,1357,None,,,,,
,1359,Better Choice And Quality Of Food Available In The Bistro Restaurant. A Free Upgrade Instead Of Having To Pay Â£40 To Hve A Room With A View Would Have Been A Nice Touch.(The Hotel Wasnt Busy On That Day.),,,,,
,1361,Ban Mobiles In The Bar Nearest The Edwardian Restuarant.,,,,,
,1362,Breakfast Was Poor  Fruit Salad Was Discoloured  With A Poor Amount Of Fruit Variety  And Was Small.  Tea Was Luke Warm And Some Items Were Missing.  All Rectified Quickly  But This Detracted From Eating Breakfast In The Room.  The Breakfast Experience Did Not Fit With The Overall Experience Of The Rest Of Our Stay  And Would Put Us Off Having In Room Dining In The Future. ,,,,,
,1363,Not Automatically Add Service Charge On To Everything We Purchased. We Are Adults And Should Have The Choice To Recognise Good Service And Not Automatically Be Charged For It. Very Annoying And Unnecessary.,,,,,
,1364,Nothing  Our Stay Was Perfect,,,,,
,1365,Provide Us With Another Fab Offer Like The One We Had And We Will Come Back Very Shortly!  Possibly With My Family For My 40Th Very Soon!,,,,,
,1366,We Were A One Night Stay And On Returning To Our Room At 10.15Am On The Day Of Check Out There Was A Lady Servicing It And This Meant We Couldn't Use The Bathroom Before Leaving And Made Us Feel A Bit Awkward About Gathering Our Belongings. As We Were Checking Out That Day The Room Really Shouldn't Have Been Serviced Until After 11Am Which Was Our Check Out Time.  We Think It Would Be A More Pleasant Experience If The Pool Were A Few Degrees Warmer.,,,,,
,1367,I Think I Have Covered This Already. Perhaps A More Prompt Service For Coffee And Plates Cleared In Between Courses (Both V Simple Things) The Establishment Is Dreamy  I Loved It And Your Attention To Detail And The Choice Of Breakfast Was Great  Loved The Dried Fruits  Yogurt And High Quality Granola. ;-),,,,,
,1369,Just Remembered That On Our Second Night We Were Not Given Turn Down Service.,,,,,
,1370,If The Breakfast And Dinners Were As Good As The Rest Of The Hotel And Service The Experience Would Have Exceeded Our Expectations.  This Is A Great Pity As I Would Love To Return Next Easter But Might Not Due To The Lack Of Confidence In The Kitchen.  Otherwise We Really Liked Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,1374,Nothing.  (But Please Do Sort Out The Kettle Situation!),,,,,
,1378,No Everything Exceeded Our Expectations,,,,,
,1383,Not At All  It Was The Best Service That We Have Ever Experienced In Our Lives,,,,,
,1385,You Could Have Made Us Aware Of The 'Mobile Phone Booster' In The New Restaurant  As I Missed An Important Telephone Call During My Stay.,,,,,
,1388,I Was Expecting A Trully Memorable Stay  And That Is Exactly What We Got. Very Well Done And Thanks To You All.,,,,,
,1389,No  We Had A Truly Lovely Time.,,,,,
,1390,Breakfast Was Not Included In The Room Rate  Little Disappointed With That,,,,,
,1397,Valet Car Service,,,,,
,1400,12.5% Service Charge Is A Bit Steep  Maybe You Could Bring This Down.,,,,,
,1404,Fixed The Remote On The Tv  The Tv Was Not Easy To Work  Everything Else Was Perfection ;-),,,,,
,1405,Better Service In The Dining Room.,,,,,
,1407,Yet Another Superb Stay With Federico And The Team. Simply Our Favourite Uk Destination.,,,,,
,1410,We Did Bring Our Dog For The First Time And He (Harvey) Was Made Most Welcome. The Only Thing Was That The Extra Charge Of Â£20 Was Meant To Include Bed And Bowls  Which Were Not Provided. It Was Not A Problem As Fortunately We Had Ours With Us As We Were Going On Somewhere Else The Following Day.,,,,,
,1411,Just The Mobile Phone Signal Hotspot.....................Although My Wife Loves The Fact I Am Unable To Use My Phone! The Digital Tv Was A  Dreadful Reception.,,,,,
,1413,No,,,,,
,1418,No It Was All Just Perfect.,,,,,
,1421,No  You Did Everything Possible To Make The Stay Perfect!,,,,,
,1423,Nothing.  Just Brilliant,,,,,
,1424,Meeting Set Up Was Poor And On Leaving My Car Had Been Moved And In Front Of It Was Another Row Of Cars So I Couldnt Leave Until I Arranged For Someone To Come And Get Cars In Front Moved,,,,,
,1426,No,,,,,
,1427,The Weather But You Are Not In Control Of That!,,,,,
,1428,The Rooms Were Supplied With High Quality Tea & Filter Coffee And To Improve The Experience Then Fresh Milk Would Have Enhanced The Experience   Although Staff In The Oak Room Supplied Milk When Requested.,,,,,
,1429,Not Unless You Could Make The Weather Warmer!,,,,,
,1430,Nibbles In The Bar.....Would Be More Inclined To Order Another Drink. The Goring In London Is Our Stop Of Choice In London For Drinks Because Of This And Their Quality.,,,,,
,1431,Mini Bar In Room And Ice.,,,,,
,1432,Not At All Everyone Went The Extra Mile ,,,,,
,1434,Re-Train Your Staff  I Got My Stay At The Hotel Cheap Compared To The Usual Rack Rate Which Is Why I Did Not Say Anything While I Was There But If I Would Have Been Paying Full Rate I Would Have Made Much More Of A Fuss As I Expected 5* Service And Most Definitely Did Not Receive It! Also I Was Supposed To Be Relaxing So I Did Not Want To Cause Any Issues That Ould Lead To Stress  The Whole Point Of Me Coming There Was To Relax.,,,,,
,1435,The Childcare Needs To Be Looked At.... The Playroom Is Great & Bovey Rangers Are Great But Bovey Rangers Only Runs For 1.5Hrs (Not Long Enough For Parents To Enjoy Spa Treatments Or Rounds Of Golf Together) - Children Of Rangers Age Are Not Impressed With Going To The Playroom For The Extra Hour!   Also  I Think You Need A 'Kids' Room Where The 7-12Yr Age Group Can Hang Out  Play Playstation Or Table Hockey  Do Lego  Watch Dvds Etc While Parents Are In The Bar Or Having Dinner. Children Of This Age Dont Need Watching 100% Time But I Think They Get Bored In The Bar So Would Happily Trot Off To Watch Dvds  Popping Back Whenever They Wanted Something. All Other Family Friendly Luxury Hotels Have This Facility Open All Day And Until 10-11Ish. Your Babysitting Charges Are Rediculous So I Also Feel This Would Encourage Parents Into The Grill In The Evenngs.,,,,,
,1441,Nothing What So Ever!,,,,,
,1442,No,,,,,
,1443,I Would Of Preferred To That The Service Charge Was Optional Rather Than Included  Not That I Didn't Want To Leave A Tip  But I Would Prefer To Judge For Myself The Level.,,,,,
,1444,Please See Previous Comments You Have Set Such High Standards That It Is Noticeable When It Slips. We Have Also Visited At Peak Times Previously So We Know It Can Be Achieved,,,,,
,1445,The Only Thing I Could Suggest And This Is Not A Complaint At All  I Was The Coach Driver That Brought The Group To Bovey.. I Could Have Used Some Help To Turn The Coach Around In The Grounds  Which Was Very Tricky.. Then Again  I Should Have Asked So As I Said  This Is Not A Complaint At All.,,,,,
,1447,Improve The Food. Improve Colour Of Tap Water.,,,,,
,1448,You Should Improve Mobile Connections.  Free Wifi Should Not Be Limited To Few Mb-,,,,,
,1451,The Dining Experience Was A Real Let Down For Us As We A Complete Foodies. We Found Breakfast Service Slow On The First Day And Had To Remind Staff For Coffee And Tea Which They Had Forgotten And Some Toast! When Traveling With A Toddler It Is More Important To Get These Things Promptly To Keep The Child Quiet.,,,,,
,1452,A Room Availability Time Would Have Been Helpful As We Felt A Bit Lost Sitting In The Lounge For The Afternoon In Case A Member Of The Team Called Us.,,,,,
,1455,We Wanted A Weekend Doing What We Wanted To Do Without Being Pestered So No If We Wanted Something We Would Have Asked For It .,,,,,
,1457,At One Point We Walked Out Of The Bar After Waiting Some Time To Be Served.  While We Were Waiting The Staff Were Paying More Attention To Clearing Empty Tables And The Last Straw Was When A Party Arrived And Served Straight Away And Still We Hadn't Been Acknowledged,,,,,
,1463,More Explanation As To Location Of All The Facilities And What Was Available On Arrival Solution To The Problematic Smoke Alarm In The Lodge.,,,,,
,1464,I Don't Think It Could Have Been Any More Perfect  I Just Wish We Could Have Stayed For More Than Just One Night. We Have Never Stayed In A Hotel As Grand As This Before And I Was Slightly Worried That We Would Feel Intimidated Or Out Of Place But That Was Not The Case At All. We Felt Extremely Welcome And At Ease Throughout Our Stay.,,,,,
,1465,Last Time We I Went Someone Showed Us The Bar And The Lounge Rooms So We Had A Rough Orientation Of The Place - This Didn't Happen This Time Which Is A Shame As It Can Be Quite A Confusing Place And Means You Need To Ask Where Things Are.,,,,,
,1466,No  Everything Was Fantastic,,,,,
,1472,It Would Have Been Nice To Know About Activities Around The Castle And If Sports Equipment Could Be Hired. Also  Shooting Schedules Ought To Be Publicised - One Of Our Party Had Clay Pigeon Debris Fall On Him While He Was Jogging In Front Of The Castle. Shooting Was Stopped To Let Him Pass But If There Had Been A Notice Up He Wouldn't Have Taken That Route. It Couldn't Have Been A Pleasant Thing To Happen For The Guests Taking Part Either.,,,,,
,1473,We Had A Great Unexpected Couple Of Days Added On To The End Of Our Holiday At Bovey Castle And We Loved It Enough To Know That We Will Come Again.,,,,,
,1474,We Had A Supplement Fot Dinner Which Was Part Of Our Deal Booked With Secret Escapes. This Deduction Could Have Been Clearer On The Bill.,,,,,
,1477,No,,,,,
,1478,Foods For Children Needs Addressing.I Felt Staff Became Less Friendly The Longer You Stayed,,,,,
,1479,Check In On The Day Of Arrival Would Have Been Nicer If We Could Have Earlier. We Arrived Around 12 But Wasn't Told Our Room Was Ready Till Around 3.30 -4. Although We Were Happy Having Tea Etc By The Fire And The Kids Were At Bovey Rangers  It Would Have Just Been Nicer To Feel Settled A Little Earlier.,,,,,
,1482,Wish Bovey Castle Was Closer To Our Home So We Could Visit More Frequent.,,,,,
,1485,Wifi Should Be Much Quicker In All Rooms Without Extra Charge.,,,,,
,1486,A Better Break Down Of The Bill Might Help  Eg Instead Of Beverages  More Details Of What Food  Drinks  When And Where...When Signing A Bill 1 Week Later It Was Impossible To Recall What We Ate/Drank When And Where. That's An Observation To Help Me Be Clearer About What I Have Been Charged For.,,,,,
,1488,No Not At All ,,,,,
,1490,To Not Allow Dogs Within The Establishment As 5 Star Luxury And Dogs Dont Really Go Together In My Opinion,,,,,
,1491,I Dont Think You Should Automatically Add Service Charge To Bill It Should Be Down To Each Person To Tip Who They Were Happy With,,,,,
,1492,It Would Have Been Nice To Have Lockers In The Changing Rooms.,,,,,
,1493,We Understand The Hotel Is For Sale And We Thought It Showed In 'The Little Things' (No Throws On All The Lodge Beds  Tvs Not In All Rooms  Internet Access Still Poor  No Fluffy Robes Any More  Slow And Inaccurate Service In Restaurants/Bars)Bovey Is Still A Marvellous Place But I Would Like To See Continuing Investment - Feels Like Its Being Run For Profit/Cash Ahead Of A Sale. We Would Need To See What The New Owners Were Going To Do Before Coming Back. Since We Were A Party Of 8  Lodge And One Bedroom In The House  And We Have Been Before Several Times I Am Sure We Are More Sensitive Than Many Others  But It Was Definitely Not As Good As Our Previous Stays.,,,,,
,1495,On Checking Out I Was Surprised  To See Some Of The Costs Of The Activities. We Booked The Quad Biking And Clay Shooting As Private Sessions. Now I Realise That There Would Be A Premium For This  I Do  Think That A Indication Of The Cost Could Have Been Mentioned Then. I Am Partly To Blame For Not Asking Also  I Will Know Better Next Time.,,,,,
,1496,No,,,,,
,1499,No,,,,,
,1500,More Professional Staff For The Standard Of The Hotel,,,,,
,1502,Although Every Effort Was Made To Rectify  We Did Have An On-Going Problem With The Availability Of Hot Water In Our Lodge.,,,,,
,1504,We Felt Some Of The Foreign Waiters Needed More Training To Achieve The Standards We Experienced Everywhere Else At Bovey Castle,,,,,
,1505,The Only Issue We Had During Our Stay Was The Boiler In The Lodge. Otherwise We Had An Extremely Enjoyable Stay And Were Made To Feel Extremely Welcome By All The Staff.,,,,,
,1507,The Service Charge Made Us Feel Very Uncomfortable And As A Result We Paid It. We Probably Paid Over Â£100 In Service Charge Throughout The Two Days Which Is Unacceptable Really. We Thought We Would Be Able To Take The Sc Off The Bill At The End But Upon Checkout We Realised This Just Wasn't Possible. The Bill Was Not Itemised Just Broken Down By Restaurant And Bar. This Should Be Improved With A Opt In For Service Not Opt Out,,,,,
,1513,Frederico Was Very Attentive And Enjoyed Speaking To Him.  Sorry To Miss Him On Our Departure.,,,,,
,1514,Only Quibble Would Be The Bistro. Lunchtime Menu Was Limited. Smaller Options Like Sandwiches  Omelettes  Jacket Potatoes Would Have Been Better. Because Breakfasts Are Large And Afternoon Tea Is An Option  You Don't Need A Meal At Lunch Time So Smaller Options Would Be Nice.,,,,,
,1515,Maybe Vary The Activities. They Do Become A Bit Boring - The Same Day After Day.,,,,,
,1516,No Once Again It Was A Great Experience!,,,,,
,1517,Let Us Stay For An Extra Night For Free!!,,,,,
,1519,Stayed For A Longer Time To Make Full Use Of All The Facilities Available.,,,,,
,1521,No We Were Very Impressed And Will Be Back. Thank You For Making Our Stay Very Memorable.,,,,,
,1523,Nothing,,,,,
,1528,No - Everything Was Just Perfect,,,,,
,1530,Nothing Else Needed,,,,,
,1536,Map Of Grounds,,,,,
,1537,No It Was All Wonderful. I Can't Say It Exceeded My Expectations As I Knew What To Expect But It Was All Lovely. We Hope To Come Back In May.,,,,,
,1539,It Took A Bit Too Long To Get Drinks In The Bar. We Probably Would Have Ordered More If It Had Been A Bit Quicker.,,,,,
,1541,More Imaginative Vegetation Menu,,,,,
,1542,Do Need To Double Check Milk Not Too Warm In Fridge In Room Possibly Fridge Not Working Properly. And The Pre-Dinner Nibbles As Not Sure What Happened But The Quails Egg Was Most Definitely Off.,,,,,
,1548,See Comments Re Golf.  In Every Other Respect We Greatly Enjoyed Our Stay.  It Was Certainly What We Had Come To Expect At Bovey.,,,,,
,1549,No,,,,,
,1550,Yes - Ensure That All Your Staff (Whether Of A Temporary) Nature Sell Your Brand According To Your Standards.,,,,,
,1551,No Everything Was Excellent,,,,,
,1552,I Think The Weather Was Out Of Your Control  So No!,,,,,
,1553,No Not Really.,,,,,
,1555,Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Bottle Of Wine Or Fruit In Our Room As A Welcome Gift To Celebrate Our Anniversary.  That Would Have Been Such A Lovely Touch,,,,,
,1557,I Think A Bit More Clarity About Checking In Times....The Setting And The Grounds Were So Beautiful It Was Lovely To Relax Until It Was Time To Go To Our Room,,,,,
,1560,The Room Given Was Awful And Assumed As Travel Zoo Clients This Was The Poor Room Allocated And Were Very Surprised And Ruined The Overall Experience. We Also Heard From Others That The Place Is Being Sold And This Could Be The Reason For Such A Dilapidated Place.,,,,,
,1563,No.,,,,,
,1564,Yes Teach Me To Play Golf And Sunday Lunch More In Keeping With The Excellence Of Bovey Castle,,,,,
,1565,Please Display Your Phone Charges Clearly  Especially Since Mobile Phones Do Not Work In All Of The Bedrooms. I Was Caught Out And Wouldn't Want It To Happen To Anyone Else.,,,,,
,1566,The Lunch Menu Could Have Been Better - The Soup Hot (It Was Semi Warm) And The Break For Sandwiches Could Have Been Better Quality,,,,,
,1567,As The Dinner Was Exceptional  Expected The Same For The Full Breakfast  Unfortunately This Was Not The Same Standard And The Service Was Less Attentive  Had To Ask Twice For Coffee  I Know This Is Little Things  Had To Wait A Long Time For The Eggs To Be Re-Filled And The Fruit Tray Only Had Two Bits Of Watermelon On For Ages  But When We Left Everything Had Been Re-Filled  Just Would Have Been Nice To Have Be A Little More Organised.,,,,,
,1569,It Was A Fab Experience And I Would Recommend Your Hotel To Anyone And Look Forward To The Opportunity To Come Back.,,,,,
,1570,I Expected To Find My Car Where I Had Left It But In The End Spent Some Time Searching Before Asking A Staff Member If He Knew Where It Was  He Did So Search Ended But It Would Have Been Nice If Someone Had Thought To Tell Me It Had Been Moved Up To Near The Entrance When We Checked Out! A Very Minor Niggle But Had It Been Raining I Might Have Felt A Bit Grumpy About It!,,,,,
,1574,Not At All...But If You Can Have Other Dining Option Specially For The Breakfast It Would've Been Better...,,,,,
,1575,I Don't Feel That Our Experience At Bovey Castle Could Have Been Bettered  It's Was Truly Special.,,,,,
,1578,Better Food!,,,,,
,1579,More Availability During Half Terms Etc For The Spa Experience.,,,,,
,1580,Just Felt That The Bathrooms Could Be Better.,,,,,
,1581,Some Copies Of Exeter Living Among The Luxurious Magazines!,,,,,
,1582,The Service Charge Is Clearly An Issue With Everyone. My Inlaws Recommended The Hotel  Said It Was Wonderful  But The Second Time They Visited They Encountered The Service Charge And Didn't Return. Our Bill Only Contained The Service Charges Relating To Food  Which I Can Understand. But It Does Look Fairly Complicated On The Bill As Each Drink At The Bar  In The Restaurant And The Food Are All Charged Separately And Charges Added To Each One. I Don't Have A Huge Problem With Charges On The Food As We Would Normally Tip Anyway. But There Must Be A More Concise Way Of Doing It. And I'm Not So Sure A Service Charge On Bar Bills Are Necessary  The Drinks Aren't Cheap To Begin With So The Service Costs Could Surely Be Taken From The Profit.,,,,,
,1585,No It Was All Very Very Good Cant Wait To Come Back,,,,,
,1589,Not This Time - It Was Lovely.,,,,,
,1590,When Leaving You Had Blocked Off Access From Lodges To Castle. We Were Advised To Drive Right Round Estate As Not Allowed To Drive Through Castle Courtyard- We Refused And Drove Through,,,,,
,1591,Cafe Menu Was A On The Large Size. Smaller Bites May Have Been In Order.,,,,,
,1592,Not In The Slightest.,,,,,
,1594,Service In The Bistro Was Very Slow But They Were Very Busy,,,,,
,1601,Overall A Very Pleasant Stay.,,,,,
,1602,Create Enough Spa Time As Advertised In Your Bookings And Pay More Attention To Customers At Breakfast.,,,,,
,1603,Many Of Us Found The Hotel Too Warm  The Temperature Could Have Been Turned Down A Few Degrees!,,,,,
,1604,The Hotel Did Exceed Our Expectations But We Felt The Bedroom Could Have Been Better.,,,,,
,1605,When Making Promises Even Simple Ones Should Be Carried Out Or At Least An Explanation Given As To Why Not I.E. The Promise To Arrange Umbrellas  They Never Materialised And No Reason Was Given Even Though We Continued To Request Them.,,,,,
,1606,Perfect Stay  Very Much Enhanced By The Professionalism And Dedication Of All The Staff!,,,,,
,1607,Dont Be Silly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Loved It And We Will Be Back Within The Month With All Our Friends Again With The Kids  Come On The Bovey Rangers!!!!,,,,,
,1609,Nothing Springs To Mind - We All Enjoyed Ourselves. Oh My Son Complained About The Amount Of Horse Poo On The Golf Course! Apparently His Ball Kept Landing In It - Not Sure What You Can Do About This.,,,,,
,1613,Yes. As The Edwardian Was Closed The First 2 Nights We Were There We Had Breakfast In The Bistro Where The Views Are Lovey. I Did Wonder Whether This Could Be Open For Breakfast In The Future?,,,,,
,1615,No  Everything Was At The Usual Standard.,,,,,
,1616,As Stated Previously The Cooked Breakfast Was Extremely Disappointing.,,,,,
,1618,No,,,,,
,1620,Yes  A Smile And An Acknoledgement Of One's Presence Would Be Good On Arrival. Getiing The Bill Right For A One Night Stay Should Not Be Too Much To Ask,,,,,
,1626, All Staff Were Very Courteous And Welcoming And Made Us Feel 'At Home'. However  Umprove The Speed Of Service In The Grill And At Breakfast Would Enhance The Overall Experience.  In Addition  The Waiter Who Took Our Order Did Not Appear To Be Too Confident In Recommending Wines To Go With Different Dishes On The Menu. The Recommendation He Made Was Enjoyed By My Fellow Diners (I Did Not Drink)  So That Was Not A Problem.  I Work In The Wine Business Myself And I Was Just Surprised That A Hotel Of Bovey's Standing There Was Not A Qualified Sommelier And/Or That Not All Waitinv Staff Are Confident In Food In Wine Matching.  There Was A Hot Breakfast Buffet On The Subday Morning  But All The Plates Were Cold. We And Several Other Guests Commented That Their Should Be A Warm Plates Available.,,,,,
,1628,Disappointed That The Golf Was So Expensive. May Have Considered Playing If Priced More Reasonably.,,,,,
,1629,No  It Was Everything We Expected And More.,,,,,
,1638,Nope. We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay And Wished We Had Booked For Longer.,,,,,
,1639,The Walk Info Was Useful Near The Castle. Information Around The Area Was Standard Devon Stuff.  Some Of This Was Quite Disappointing To Experience.  Bovey Tracey For Example.  We Found Some Excellent Walks And Pubs In Other Places - But This Was Via Our Own Internet Searching. It Would Be Good To Capture And Share Local Knowledge Or Other Guests Recomendations Of Things To Do Etc.,,,,,
,1640,Service At Breakfast Very Poor Had To Wait 30 Mins Before Having Coffee And Tea  Breakfast Order Incorrect  Waiter Very Unfriendly And Hardly Spike,,,,,
,1641,No  The Level Of Service Was Excellent And Exactly What I Expected From Your Hotel.,,,,,
,1642,The Hot Tub Needs To Be Hot Not The Same Temp As The Swimming Pool,,,,,
,1645,When We Explained There Were No Bathrobes In Our Room Although We Had An Apology It Would Have Been Nice To Have Been Asked If We Had Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,
,1646,Other Than The Bistro Which We Were Disappointed With And My Son Would Like You To Improve Ease Of Access To Your Wi-Fi  Our Stay Was Excellent. A Map Of The Local Area Would Have Been Useful And A Suggested Cycle Route! It Would Also Have Been Good To Know About The Courses You Ran In Advance (On Your Tv System Or A Newsletter) As By The Time We Found Out About The Clay Pigeon Shooting And Small Bore Rifle They Were Fully Booked. We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Talk And Bird Of Prey Display. And Finally We Hope You Do A Discount For Regular Visitors As We Hope To Be Back Soon!,,,,,
,1649,A Working Wc Or At Least A Discount To Reflect All Was Not Up To Standard. Guests In My House Do Not Have To Put Up With Broken Toilets,,,,,
,1651,Was Disappointed At The Cost And Generally Uninspiring Restaurant Menu So We Did Not Dine In The Hotel For The First Time Ever. This Was A Pity As We Would Have Liked To Have Done So.,,,,,
,1652,Everything Lived Up To Our Expectations And We Had A Wonderful Time Although Very Short.,,,,,
,1655,The Final Bill Did Not Come With Any Documentation -- Just Bar Or Grill Or Service.  You Have Got To Get A Billing System That Shows What Was Ordered!!!  Wine Selection -- Price -- Tea Selection -- Price Etc.   Your Prices Are 5 Star -- Your Service Should Be Better.,,,,,
,1663,No It Was All Fantastic,,,,,
,1664,We Were Booked Into The Bistro The Forst Night We Arrived But It Was Closed And Noone Informed Us. We Had Dinner In The Bar Area So It Was Fine.  In The Spa  The Massage Oil Should Be Heated Before Applying To Clients Body  Also Heated Bed And Fluffy Towels To Cover The Client.  In The Relaxation Area   Jugs Of Water Could Be Infused With Fresh Mint And Cucumber Or Lemon In Another. A Plate Of Homemade Biscuits Could Also Be Served. These Little Touches Really Would Show The Clients You Care About The Extra Touches And I Bet You Feedback Would Be Really Positive.,,,,,
,1670,Little. . . Generally Very Good !,,,,,
,1671,The Tv Reception Could Be Improved.,,,,,
,1672,I Understand You Do A 'Takeaway' Menu For Guests Staying In The Lodges. It Would Have Been Very Nice To Have Had A Menu To Peruse In The Cottage.,,,,,
,1673,Stopped It From Raining.We Will Just Have To Return In The Sunshine.,,,,,
,1674,The Weather Was Very Bad And The Planned Golf Did Not Go Ahead Were You To Be Able To Arrange Good Weather That Would Be Amazing!!!,,,,,
,1675,When My Daughter And Boyfriend Checked Out  They Were Told The Bags Would Be Put In The Car. They Hadn't Been  Which Meant They Had To Return To The Hotel After A 20 Minute Drive Out.,,,,,
,1676,See Previous Comments Re Dining,,,,,
,1677,Staff Need Training - Not Up To The Standards Of This Type Of Hotel - All A Bit Amateur And Dress Code Uniforms Of The Women In Reception And Welcoming Was Inappropriate,,,,,
,1680,As Stated - Softer Pillows And  More Control In The Swimming Pool.,,,,,
,1681,No  It Was Perfect,,,,,
,1683,The Television Menu Should Have A Place Where You Can Monitor Your Bill During Your Stay And As I Said The Internet And Wi-Fi Service Should Have Been Better.,,,,,
,1685,One Of The Rooms Did Not Have Hot Water - Chris Szymkowicz's But It Was Sorted Out Thanks,,,,,
,1688,Internal Map Within The Room ( - Appologies If I Missed It!),,,,,
,1693,Nothing!,,,,,
,1696,As We Were There On Business It Was Frustrating For Some Of Our Group That Internet And Mobile Phone Connectivity Were Difficult - But It Is Dartmooor!,,,,,
,1699,Air Conditioning In Room??,,,,,
,1701,No,,,,,
,1702,Only Problem Was Locating My Wifes Bag That Had Been Taken From The Room On Check-Out But Was Not Actually In The Car When We Went To Leave!  Probably Because The Golf Staff Had The Key To The Car - So Just A Brief Period Of Panic Until It Was Located Behind Reception!,,,,,
,1703,In The Bathroom There Was No Handrail To Aid Entering And Leaving The Bath And There Was No Non-Slip Surface In The Bath Or A Non-Slip Mat.,,,,,
,1705,Just Improve Breakfast Service,,,,,
,1706,Regarding The Checkout  A Few Items Appeared On My Bill From A Lunch That I Hadn't Had  And It Was Difficult To See Exactly What Went Into The Drinks Bill As It Wasn't Itemised.    Therefore I Would Have Liked To Have Seen A Fully Itemised Bill  And Because I Didn't Want The Hassle Of Asking For Receipts To Be Dredged Up  I Didn't Request This  Leaving Me Questioning Whether There Had Been Any Extra Items That Were Added To My Bill And Paid For  That Weren't Actually Mine.,,,,,
,1708,The Tour On Arrival Was Useful.  Competion Cards In The Reception For A Free Stay Expired In January 2013  So Shoud Lbe Removed.,,,,,
,1710,Our Bill Had About Â£120 Of Erroneous Charges On It  Which I Consider Poor. I Did A So Waive One Of The Two Â£30 Lodge Charges As We Did Not Have The Lodge Cleaned So I Thought An Additional Â£60 Service Charge Was Excessive,,,,,
,1714,Nothing,,,,,
,1719,No,,,,,
,1720,All Comments On This Are Above.,,,,,
,1721,We Had To Return To Get Golf Clubs Not Loaded In Car. Paid Some Discretionary Charges.,,,,,
,1723,No Nothing.,,,,,
,1724,No It Was All Good,,,,,
,1725,Sunshine !!,,,,,
,1726,No  Not Really.  If You Just Get The Staff To Address The Details Then You Would Deliver That Extra Level Of Service And Attention One Is Looking For  At The End Of The Day Its The Pro Activity And The Passion Among The Staff That Makes A Difference  Both For Guests And Colleagues.,,,,,
,1727,See Comments Re Bistro Food.,,,,,
,1728,The Whole Stay Was Excellent Beautiful Building Surroundings And Most Helpful Staff. The Only Comment Would Be The Lack Of Mobile Phone Service And Breakfast Could Have Been A Bit More Efficient. We Had To Wait A Long Time For Coffee/ Tea And Then The Eggs We Ordered Came After We Finished Our Cooked Breakfast. Nothing To Spoil The Experience For Us Though.,,,,,
,1730,No Lockers In Pool Area. Changing Room Very Cramped  Let Down The Overall Experience Of Pool Area.,,,,,
,1733,Ensure Mobile Phone Coverage !!!,,,,,
,1735,Just One Unfortunate Experience With The Service At Dinner On One Evening Took The Edge Off Of The Overall Experience  However We Would Stay Again And Have Already Recommended The Hotel To Friends.,,,,,
,1737,Bill Was Wrong  Charged Twice For Our Food. Not What I Expect From Your Hotel,,,,,
,1740,Suggest You Get A Few Decent Chefs,,,,,
,1741,I Have Ticked Met  As The Venue Is Exquisite  We Felt That The Overall Standard Had Dropped Since Our Last Visit Approximately 2 Years Ago And Another 1 1/2 Yrs Prior.,,,,,
,1744,The Service Charge Was Not Straight Forward If Its Discretionary It Should Be On A Separate Bill And Not On The Main Account This Way You Would Not Feel Obliged To Pay It When Leaving Or A Set Amount Daily For The Service Charge Payable ,,,,,
,1747,Fudge Or Chocolate Should Be Left Every Night,,,,,
,1748,Bistro Serving ' Barbecues' E.G Steaks Would Have Enhanced It's Value.,,,,,
,1750,The Food Was Disappointing. We Had Chosen Bovey Castle As It Was My Birthday And Had Expected Something Better.,,,,,
,1751,Refurbish And Totally Revamp The Edwardian Restaurant  It Is Not A Pleasant Room To Eat In Especially With Only A Few Tables ..,,,,,
,1753,No,,,,,
,1757,Lights On The Pathways From The Lodges Would Have Been Very Helpful  As We Struggled To Navigate Our Way Up To The Hotel For Dinner On Dark Evenings.,,,,,
,1759,There Were A Few Issues Transferring Golf Equipment From Golf Shop To The Hotel. Almost Would Have Been Easier For Me To Carry Myself But A Welcome Gesture.,,,,,
,1762,Cell Phone And Wifi Access  Access To Edwardian Grill  Very Disappointed That The Draught Bitter Was Unavailable For Our Entire Stay Despite Me Asking For It Repeatedly From The First Night And It Being Relatively Easy For You To Arrange,,,,,
,1763,The 'In Room' Tv Could Have Been A Better Performing Facility Overall.,,,,,
,1766,An Offer Of A Complimentary Game Of Golf As We Didn't Get To Play The Whole Course Because Of The Water Logged Course.,,,,,
,1767,No,,,,,
,1769,I Booked As A Special Offer But Was Disappointed With The Value For Money. The Breakfast Was Not Hot And So We Complained To The Waitress And Were Not Required To Pay Which Was What I Would Have Expected. After A Previous Excellent Experience  We Were Somewhat Disappointed,,,,,
,1777,The Lack Of Mobile Phone Facilities In The Hotel And Environs  Might Be Considered A Plus  To Enable Us To Switch Off  But  For Us  It Was A Concern As We Have Elderly Relatives Who Would Not Have Been Able To Contact Us In An Emergency ,,,,,
,1778,No,,,,,
,1780,No,,,,,
,1781,It Was Probably My Fault For Not Asking  When I Booked  Whether We Had A Room At The Front.  However  Perhaps Your Staff Could Have Given Me The Option.,,,,,
,1782,Dining Experience/Golf Course Condition,,,,,
,1783,Perhaps Our Own Fault But It Would Have Been Appreciated Had We Been Warned That Treatments At The Spa Needed To Have Been Boked Well In Advance. We Tried On Three Occasions To Arrange Treatments But Had No Luck At All - And Availing Ourselves Of The Facilities Of The Spa Was One Of The Major Reasons Of Our Choosing Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,1784,Only Observation Was Around The Bedroom Fit-Out,,,,,
,1786,If You Are Not Able To Serve Food That Is Shown On The Bistro Menu  Please Let The Diner Be Aware  Not Produce A Plate With A Substitute Without Prior Warning.  We Were Also Disappointed That The Dining Room Was Rather Small And Could Not Accommodate All Residents For Meals.  We Do Not Expect This In A 5 Star Hotel.  Rather Disappointing That We Were Unable To Dine In The Main Restaurant.,,,,,
,1787,Just Been Able To Stay Twice As Long For The Same Money!,,,,,
,1788,Staff Could Have Been A Little More 'Clued Up' About The Nature Of Our Stay (Birthday Celebration)  Eg Around The Afternoon Tea When We Arrived.,,,,,
,1789,Prolonged The Stay,,,,,
,1791,The Golf Course Was Closed On One Day So We Lost A Round Of Golf. We Were Not Offered Another Round Of Golf At Any Point In Order To Compensate. As We Were There On A Golf Break We Thought This Very Poor.,,,,,
,1793,We Were On A Golf Break For 2 Rounds Of Golf And An Overnight Dinner  Bed And Breakfast Deal. We Were (Understandably) Not Able To Play Golf On The First Day - Sunday 4Th November Due To The Weather And The Course Being Wet. Despite Rain Overnight The Course Was Open The Next Day --??,,,,,
,1797,Fix The Aforementioned Problems With The Lodge.,,,,,
,1798,The Castle Is Lovely  And Had We Not Been In Room 47  And The Owners Of The Vintage Cars Had Perhaps Not Acted Like Boy Racers At 7A.M. We Would Come Again With Friends And Rlay Golf,,,,,
,1800,Apart From The Fact That My Sat Nav Was Telling Me To Do A Reverse Turn  As We Drove Up To The  Hotel  The Poor Signage In The Approach To The Hotel Could Be Improved. Local Tourism Chiefs Must Be Aware Of The Economic Importance Of The Hotel To The Area And Act Accordingly.,,,,,
,1802,Nothing At All Thankyou,,,,,
,1804,We Had To Wait 45 Mins While Staff Searched For Car Drivers Who Had Blocked Our Car. If I Had Not Complained And Called For Management Intervention It Would Have Been Much Longer. When We Arrived There Were Few Cars Outside The Hotel But All Free Areas Coned Off. On The Morning Of Our Departure You Had A Conference Running  There Was No Control Of Parking  And Many Cars Had Been Double Parked. Your Reception Staff Failed To Consider That The Offending Cars Were Associated With The Conference. Only The Energetic Assistance Of The General Manager Solved The Problem.,,,,,
,1805,Maybe Produce Daily 'Specials' In The Restaurant?,,,,,
,1807,I Think Bovey Castle Is A Jewel Which Provides An Oasis Of Luxury In My Hectic Life,,,,,
,1810,No,,,,,
,1816,A Couple Of Staff Interactions Did Not Meet The Standard Of The Others - Certainly Nothing To Complain About But In Contrast We Were Surprised.... The Welcome At Breakfast Was Not As Warm As The Others  Neither Do I Think We Were Asked If We Had Enjoyed The Breakfast. The Receptionist On Departure Was Very Warm And Friendly But Did Not Ask If We Had Enjoyed The Stay Etc... I Did Make The Point That We Had.,,,,,
,1818,The Band Were Far Too Loud For Most Of Our Party In The Evening. They Were Excellent But Also The Volume Meant Half The Group (Ipg Dental) Went To The Main Hotel So They Could Talk Without Shouting.,,,,,
,1819,We Love The Hotel And Its Beautiful Surroundings And We Look Forward To Our Next Visit,,,,,
,1820,Free Wifi,,,,,
,1826,No  Nothing. It Was A Very Lovely And Peaceful Haven For The Time We Were Able To Spend There.,,,,,
,1831,Check Out Was Very Slow As There Was Only One Receptionist And About 7 People Waiting To Check Out  So It Was A Long Wait.,,,,,
,1832,No We Were Perfectly Satisfied Everything Was Beyond Our Expectations,,,,,
,1833,Breakfast On The First Morning Was Very Poor - Self Service Food Was Below Average.  I Asked For Fruit Tea And Was Told Only Peppermint Tea Available. Yet I Had Really Nice Fruit Tea Bags In The Box In The Bedroom.,,,,,
,1834,None Of The Management Made An Appearance Over The Weekend. It Is Always Reassuring If They Are Visible. Fortunately  None Were Needed By Me.,,,,,
,1836,Firmer Mattress In Room. Served Arbrooth Smokies As On  Breakfast Menu  Not Kippers. Served Soft Scrambled Egg  As Requested Not In Firm To Fit In Smoked Salmon Ring And Not Edible .,,,,,
,1837,Always Offer Hot Water With A Pot Of Tea And More Milk. The Plates At Breakfast For The Hot Food Were Stone Cold And The English Breakfast On The Buffet Was Mostly Cold. We  Were Not Offered More Toast And The Amount Of Butter Served Was Inadequate. There Were Lots Of Dirty Dishes Left In The Corridor From Room Service Which Had Not Been Cleared By Late Next Morning.,,,,,
,1838,Not For The Reason We Were There  We Were There For A Wedding  I Do Fish And I Do Clay Shoot And So Maybe On A Further Visit  Or If We Had Had Longer  I Would Have Like To Have Done That.,,,,,
,1843,I Was At Bovey Castle Many Years Ago When Peter De Savery Had Recently Purchased And It Was In Pristine Condition.  I Think It Is Now Looking A Little Tired And Certainly The Carpets Need To Be Steam Cleaned  Lots Of Evidence Of Spillage Throughout Hotel,,,,,
,1848,I Was Surprised To See We Were Charged For The Morning Papers (This Was Not Mentioned On Checkin And In Other Hotels We've Stayed In Paper Has Always Been Complimentary Considering The Cost Of The Room Is Not Insignificant),,,,,
,1852,Some Supervision For A 2.5 Year Old,,,,,
,1853,We Went For A Relaxed Atmosphere Where We Could Unwind  And That Is Exactly What We Had. Fantastic Time  Even If Only For A Couple Of Days.,,,,,
,1856,Our Room Had A Major Gap In The Main Window  Appreciate These Are Period Features But Imagine It Could Get Quite Draughty When The Wind Gets Up,,,,,
,1861,Offer Cooked Breakfast A Little Earlier In The Morning (07:00),,,,,
,1865,Get A Pest Control Officer To Sort The Wasps,,,,,
,1866,We Had A Wonderful Stay  Thank You.  It Is A Wonderfully Relaxing Environment In Which To Get Away From It All Which Was Just What We Wanted. It Is Very Rare That We Spend So Much Time In The Hotel We Are Staying  But We Didn't Want To Leave - A Haven Of Peace And Tranquility. The Areas I Mentioned Above Are Not Major Problems But They Do Impact On Your Experience.,,,,,
,1867,We Shall Be Back In The New Year,,,,,
,1868,Arrange For Sunny Weather!!!,,,,,
,1869,Only In The Areas Already Commented On.,,,,,
,1870,There Was Nothing Eles That Could Have Been Done For Us The Hotel And Staff Were Beyond Excellent,,,,,
,1872,Staff Were Excellent - Parasols Would Be Nice On Patio As Our Cream Tea Etc Melted Before Our Eyes In The Very Rare Sunshine. Tv Instructions In The Room - Not Being Of The Techno Generation It Took A While To Work Out,,,,,
,1874,I Would Have Appreciated A Greater Selection Of Papers And Magazines In The Lounge Rooms. Also. I Think You Should Have More Books Available On Local History And Folklore. I Can't Believe That So Few Staff Members Were Familiar With The Horror Stories Of The Hairy Hands.,,,,,
,1875,Nothing We Both Throughly Enjoyed Our Stay With You  I Would Hope To Return In The Not Too Distant Future.,,,,,
,1877,No Thank You,,,,,
,1879,Complimentary Tea/Coffee To Follow Orientation Meeting  Already Mentioned.,,,,,
,1880,No Everything Was Perfect,,,,,
,1881,Sort Out The Mobile Phone Access Or Make Hotel Calls Cheaper! The Manager Did Reduce My Bill So I Was Grateful For That. It Would Put Me Off Visiting When Phone Access Is Necessary For Important Moments In Business.  I Love To Pop Away For Short Breaks But Need To Remain In Touch With My Business At All Times.,,,,,
,1885,Maybe To Have Explained Where We Was To Have Breakfast In The Mornings But We Found That Out Ourselves,,,,,
,1886,Greater Choice Of Menus,,,,,
,1890,The Falconry Event Timing Clashed With A Late Breakfast (10/10.30Am). It Would Have Been Better To Have Had This After 11Am.,,,,,
,1891,I Really Can't Think Of Any,,,,,
,1898,Better Information/Maps About The Walks Around Bovey Castle...The Leaflet Was Unclear And There Were No Signs For The Walks. Also Clear Instructions On The Website As To How To Reach The Hotel Would Be Good And A Warning That Sat Navs Do Not Work In This Area. The Postal Address Of North Bovey Is Misleading And We Got Lost!!,,,,,
,1899,No.,,,,,
,1900,Not Really.,,,,,
,1901,It Was A Shame That My Partner Did Not Enjoy Her Relaxation In The Pool Area  Due To Others Selfishness. ,,,,,
,1903,Nothing. I Loved It And Accepted It. Anything That Was Bad I Put To The Back Of My Mind Because It Was Such A Lovely Place And I Wasn't On A Time Scale  Waiting For Food Or Anything Was Not A Problem For Me And My Partner  Thats What Drinks Are For.,,,,,
,1905,It Was Unfortunate Weather For June And Needed Some Heating.,,,,,
,1907,A Beautiful Setting  A Beautiful Castle And Staff Who Made Our Staff Even More Comfortable. Memorable Experience.,,,,,
,1917,Still Dont Quite Understand My Bill But Hey Ho It Was A Pleasure In Visiting Yourselves.,,,,,
,1918,On Day Two Of Our Stay We Visited Reception At Around 4:30Pm And Asked For The Tea And Coffee In Our Room To Be Replenished As The Milk Had Soured In The Fridge In The Room That Did Not Appear To Work.  Nothing Arrived Before We Departed To Dine In The Castle Bistro At 7:45.  I Figured The Condiments And Milk Would Be Topped Up During The Turning Down Of Our Room  However At 10Pm When We Returned There Were Still No Facilities.  Another Phone Call Remedied The Situation But I Would Not Expect To Have To Do This In A Hotel Of This Standard.,,,,,
,1919,I Don't Agree With The Discretionary Service Charge On Drinks And Accommodation. It Should Be Included In The Room Rate And Not Additional And It Should Not Be On Drinks At All. I Should Have Also Been Asked Before Invoice Produced As I Felt Obliged To Pay It Rather Then Given The Choice.,,,,,
,1920,No - You All Did A Great Job ....... We Will Definitely Be Back - We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay!,,,,,
,1922,This Is A Very Small Point And Only Something That I Have Grown Used To On My Visits To Bovey Castle But This Was The First Time That We Were Not Greeted At The Door On Arrival. It Doesn't Matter To Us As We Know The Hotel Well But It Would Have Been Nice For The Couple Who Arrived At The Same Time As Us.,,,,,
,1925,I Don't Think There Was Anything That The Staff At Bovey Castle Missed  My Every Need Was Catered For And I Had The Most Amazing Time In The Most Magnificent Setting  I Will Be Recommending You To Everyone I Speak To!!,,,,,
,1927,The Cleaner Woke Us Up In The Morning  We Didn't Need To Leave Our Room Until 11Am,,,,,
,1928,No  I Was So Happy With The Hotel  Restaurant  Spa  Staff Etc. Definitely The Most Favourite Of Hotels I've Ever Stayed In.,,,,,
,1931,Room Quaality Did Not Match The Rest Of The Experience,,,,,
,1932,Room Decor And Furnishings Particularly The Bathroom Could Do With Some Work  The Bar Staff Were Not Efficient  We Waited 20 Min For Drink Menus After Being Shown To Our Seats And Later That Evening A Further 15 Min Waiting On Both Occasions The Bar Was Almost Empty So Not Busy  I Think There Was A Private Party In The Bistro  Thus I Feel We Were Forgotten.,,,,,
,1933,The Prices For The Drinks At The Wedding Reception Were Disgusting  So Much So  That I Returned To My Room As I Was Not Prepared To Pay These Prices  On Top Of The Astronomical Price Of The Lodge. It Is Also Very Bad Practice To Put A Service Charge On To Everyting That You Serve As The Prices Are Astrinomical Without This And It Gave A Feeling That You Were Trying To Trick Us Into Paying More.,,,,,
,1934,When We Returned To Our Room After Dinner  The Bed Had Been Turned Down However The Plate We'd Had Strawberries On Was Still Left In The Room And Not Cleared Away. This Is Just A Minor Detail But Little Things Like This Do Count. No Alcoholic Drinks Or Mixers In The Fridge  Only Water And Milk.,,,,,
,1936,I Feel That The Bistro Menu Needs To Be Extended To Include Healthier Options. The Contrast Between The 2 Restaurants Needs To Be Bridged. No Hand Wash In The Bedrooms And Limited Supply Of Toilers Needs To Be Addressed.,,,,,
,1937,No,,,,,
,1940,We Were Advised That Our Room Had Been Upgraded - Thank You Very Much  It Was Levely. Friends Were Not Told They Had Been Upgraded Although When Checking Outm It Became Obvious They Had Been.   Booking Staff Knew It Was Their 30Th Anniversary Which Is Why We Believe Upgrade Occured But None Of Th Staff Actually Said This Which Missed A Trick From The 'Welcome' But Also Missed A Good Pr Opportunity.   There Should Be A Note For The Receptionist On The Booking Form So They Can 'Welcome ' The Visitor And Similarly  The Maitre 'D' Should Be Made Aware So That They Can Also Make A Bit Of A Fuss.,,,,,
,1947,I Think That A Map Of The Hotel And Grounds Could Be In Rooms We Were Offered Tour But Were Too Exhausted On Arrival,,,,,
,1948,No,,,,,
,1949,From Our Experience Every Thing Was First Class,,,,,
,1957,Service Charges On Absolutely Everything Really Notched The Bill Up. Lego - We Had To Call Three Times To Get It Delivered. Otherwise Everything Was Brilliant!!!,,,,,
,1961,Better Service When Dinning.,,,,,
,1966,Staff Were Not Clear On The Included Items In Teh Dinner Bed And Breakfast Rate  And Were Not Attanetive When Tryign To Have A Drink After Dinner Whist Seated In One Of The Reception Rooms. It Took 30 Minutes  And We Still Failed To Be Able To Order A Drink.,,,,,
,1968,More Information On Facilities Etc At Check In - We Din't Get Info On Walks In The Grounds Until The Final Day Which Was A Shame,,,,,
,1970,I Think It Was A Shame That All Of Tables In The Bar And Lounges Were Reserved For Afternoon Tea By 12 Noon On The Saturday And Sunday Although They Were Not Used For Several Hours. On Saturday Afternoon We Had To Make Tea In Our Room As There Was Not A Table For Us To Sit At.,,,,,
,1974,Not That Springs To Mind  It Was A Fantastic Stay.,,,,,
,1976,If It Hadn't Been For The Below Par  Areas In The Lodge  Our Visit Would Have Met Or Even Exceeded Our Expectations.  The Charge For The Lodge Is Not Insignificant And For This Price We Were Hoping For A Better Standard Of Cleanliness  Especially At Bovey.,,,,,
,1977,Improve Plumbing!,,,,,
,1983,Ordered Tooth Brush And Paste 3 Times But Never Arrived,,,,,
,1984,Yes  The Rooms Were Not Serviced Well Nor Every Day.  The First Morning I Was Awoken At 8.30Am For Housekeeping When I Like To Sleep In When Im On Holiday.,,,,,
,1986,Just To Give More Info On Num 21 - We Had Phoned The Previous Week To Pay For The Room In Advance. There Was No Record Of This On Departure.,,,,,
,1989,Maybe Have Horse Riding In The Grounds.,,,,,
,1995,It Would Have Been Perfect But For The Problems Mentioned Above Which Did Unfortunately Cause Our Stay To Fall Bellow Our Expectations.,,,,,
,1996,The Complexity Of The Bill  With The Added Complexity Of The Service Charge Made Departure A Rather Awkward Experience.  We Booked A Twin Room  Which Turned Out To Be A Room With A 1 Inch Gap Between 2 Beds - We Didn't Mind Too Much  As We're Good Friends  But This Could've Been Difficult For Others And Was A Little Odd For Us. Only Other Negative Is The Difficulty That Resident Guests Have In Securing A Preferred Seat In The Communal Areas During Afternoon Tea Hours  Given That Most Tables Are Reserved During This Time.,,,,,
,1999,When We Arrived We Were Asked If Would Like To Upgrade  We Were Not Offered Again Or Offered To Look At Any Further Rooms.  We Were Interested And Would Have Been Interested.,,,,,
,2000,It Was Just A Shame That Our Room Was So Disappointing Because Everything Else Was Fantastic.,,,,,
,2001,See Above,,,,,
,2003,A Little Confusing That Service Was Added On Absolutely Everything At Different Times.  Bill Confusing,,,,,
,2004,Please Try To Improve The Quality Of Meals And Dining Service. Also At Times The Restaurant Staff Seemed Confused With The Orders.,,,,,
,2007,Having Stayed Before  We Noticed That The Shower In Rose Cottage Was In Need Of Some Maintainence And Was Previously Envigorating With A Good Flow. On This Visit The Stream Was Very Sorry In Comparison.,,,,,
,2009,Bathrobe Specially When Spa Treatment Are Booked In Advance,,,,,
,2010,We Can't Stress Enough That We Feel The Price Of All Parts Of The Final Invoice Were Over-Priced. Even The Spa Which We Thoroughly Enjoyed Is Â£10 More Expensive Per Treatment Than Some Of The Best Spa's In The Uk. I Would Have Been Very Disappointed Had We Not Received An Offer (Discount) To Stay + Been Upgraded By The Manager On Arrival.,,,,,
,2012,A Bit More Polish  I Thought You Would Compare To Gleneagles Or Gidleigh Park  More Attention To Small Detail Needed  Service A Bit Sloppy.,,,,,
,2013,The Main Dining Room Was Very Attentive On Friday Night When We Booked But When We Hadn't We Didn't Get Our Order Taken In The Bar So Went Through And Then Had To Wait Over 40 Minutes For The Meal To Arrive. Not Sure If That Was Because We Hadn't Booked But Was A Little Disappointed.,,,,,
,2015,The Attention To Detail With Respect To Room Service Needs To Be Improved.,,,,,
,2017,No!,,,,,
,2018,Possibly Make It Clear To Guests When Booking Not To Set Their Sat Navs For North Bovey!,,,,,
,2019,Not Really -  Only Put Right The Negative Points Mentioned Previously.,,,,,
,2020,We Would Have Liked To Have Dined In The Edwardian Restaurant As Part Of The Secret Escapes Deal. Failing That  It Might Have Been Nice To Be Able To Upgrade For A Price. There Didn't Seem To Be A Menu On Display To See The Prices Of Meals So We Didn't Want To Ask.,,,,,
,2022,No,,,,,
,2023,Review Your Pricing Policy  Rooms And Bar.,,,,,
,2025,Pity To Have Poor Mobile Reception But Perhaps That Was Not So Bad !,,,,,
,2026,I Think The Chimneys Need Sweeping As It Is Really Unpleasant In The Public Rooms With Open Fires As The Fires Kept Smoking And The Windows Had To Be Opened  Not Good When It Is Cold.,,,,,
,2029,No,,,,,
,2030,As It Was A Bit Rainy  We Really Appreciated The Boots And Umberellas Etc. As There Was Only Size 12 Wellingtons For Men  My Husband Slopped About A Bit. I Imagine People Take The Popular Sizes  I Would People To Hand In Their Shoes To A Staff Member  So You Get The Boots Returned.,,,,,
,2032,Just A Change Of Room Would Have Been Appreciated. (Comments Above),,,,,
,2037,Better Service In The Bistro.  New Floats In The Swimming Pool - Horrible Teeth Marks,,,,,
,2039,Largely Met My Expectations  With The Exception Of The Food Issue Already Mentioned.,,,,,
,2040,It Was An Expensive Sojourn And The Setting And Access To Great Walks Coupledhigh With Very Fine Dining Made Up For A Few Disappointments Like The Room Was Cold  The Elemis Products Were Not Replaced Daily And The Use Of Discretionary Service Charges,,,,,
,2041,Nothing At All  We Had A Small Problem But It Was Dealt With By Federico Without Any Fuss And To Our Satifaction. We Look Forward To Our Next Visit.,,,,,
,2044,The Only Thing Tat Spoilt It For Us Was The Poor Room,,,,,
,2046,No - Maybe A Bottle Of Champagne As It Was A Special Anniversary!!,,,,,
,2054,It Was Such A Delight And We Were Upgraded  Which Was Such A Lovely Surprise And Added That Special Touch  Thank You,,,,,
,2055,Make Sure Each Guest Is As Important As Every Other.,,,,,
,2056,Nothing!,,,,,
,2059,Room Service Was Slow. Sometimes We Were Left Hanging In The Edwardian Restaurant Before Our Order Was Taken. Yet Again A Chair In The Edwardian Restaurant Almost Collapsed Under Me (The Same Thing Happened To My Wife On Our Previous Visit).,,,,,
,2063,Nothing I Can Really Add.,,,,,
,2066,In The Detail In The Room A Map Of The Layout So That The Pool Ect Could Be Easily Found. Information Was Got From Reception  But If You Are Arriving For A First Visit An Idea Of The Whole Layout Of Hotel And Grounds Would Be Helpful And Would Enhance The Stay.,,,,,
,2067,I Think It Would Be Better If It Weren't Possible To Reserve Parts Of The Lounges As That Way There Are Parts That Are More Difficult To Have A Seat At,,,,,
,2068,We Have Visited The Castle Before  We Have Noticed That The Special And Fantastic Standards Have Declined  Some Of The Foreign Staff Seem That They Can Not Be Bothered   We Came Across At Least Two That Were Even Slightly Rude To My Wife.,,,,,
,2069,No,,,,,
,2074,Greater Care Over In Coming And Out Coming Luggage Needs To Be Brought Into Practice.,,,,,
,2075,The Steam Room Could Definitly Benefit From Some Eucalpyptus Fragrance!,,,,,
,2076,No  It Was A Wonderfully Relaxing Break. Next Time It Will Be For Two Days!,,,,,
,2079,No,,,,,
,2080,The Overall Experience Was Excellent.  I Would Certainly Come Again  And Would Recommend Bovey Castle To Anyone Looking For A Relaxed  Peaceful And Attentive Weekend Away.,,,,,
,2081,No  It Was A Lovely Stay As Always.,,,,,
,2082,Something To Of Made Up For The Poor Dining Experience,,,,,
,2088,The Hotel Is Lovely But I Feel Needs Some Redecoration. The Outside Areas Need New Furniture  For A Five Star Hotel I Felt It Was Let Down By Tired Looking Patio Furniture. It Is A Shame The Pool Is Not Open For Longer In The Evening.,,,,,
,2089,Was My Birthday So Expected A Surprise Bottle Of Champagne In The Room With Dark Chocolates :-),,,,,
,2090,5% Service Charge On Accommodation Was A Bit Of A Shock It Would Have Been Nice To Be Asked Before Assuming It Was Ok To Add This,,,,,
,2095,Clearer On Arrival Please,,,,,
,2096,The Only Negative Comment We Made During Our Stay Was That The Piped Music In The Public Areas Was Pretty Dire!,,,,,
,2100,Improve The Castle Bistro,,,,,
,2101,....If You Had Insisted That We Couldn't Leave And Return To Our Busy And Delightful 3 Boys.... Because The  Morale  Sanity  Vision And Rhythm Of Bovey Castle Would Fail On Our Departure... (This Would Have Enhanced Our Stay!),,,,,
,2102,It Took A Few Initiatives On My Side To Finally Get Some Shoelace.... The Staff Made Some Effort But They Would Not Have Gone 'Jusqu'au Bout' Like They Would Do  In Asia.  And One Thing: Please Redecorate The Cafeteria Back To A More Compatible Style. I Think The Style Is Extremely Unfortunate And Inappropriate. It Is Like Putting The Staines Mcdonald's In Buckingham Palace. It Is Reallly A Sad 'Style Accident'.,,,,,
,2104,Our Package Was For Bed  Breakfast And Evening Meal. On Arrival We Were Told That We Had To Eat In The Bistro. As The Food We Had In The Bistro Was Of Poor Quality  I Approached The Reception Staff And Was Told That We Could Eat  In Either Restaurant And Pay The Difference. If This Was Explained On Our Arrival We Would Have Eaten In The Edwardian Grill On Both Nights.,,,,,
,2106,Although You Were Informed That We Were Celebrating Our Ruby Wedding No Acknowledgement Was Made Although Last Year ( When Celebrating An Anniversary) A Card Was Waiting In The Room(A Nice Touch),,,,,
,2108,No It Was A Wonderful Experience. As It Was A Family Surprise Birthday Party We Got To Have The Private Room Which Made It Very Special As We All Live In Different Parts Of The Country And Were Able To Stay Altogether To Catch Up.,,,,,
,2113,Basically  Very Happy. However  If You Want Feedback: 1/ Unless I Missed It  Maybe Include A Map Of The Wider Grounds (Or Indeed A Good Aerial Photo) To Aid Going For A Walk Round? 2/ Make The 'Free' Wifi A Bit Closer To The 1Mbs It Was Described As 3/ 10/11Am Departure From A Lodge Is A Bit Harder Given The Amount Of Kit Involved  Cleaning The Kitchen Etc. We Asked If We Could Leave A Bit Later  And Housekeeping Were Fine About This Which Was Much Appreciated  So No Complaints - Just Feedback.,,,,,
,2118,The Only Disappointment Was The Room But The Overall Experience Made Up For It.,,,,,
,2120,See Comments Re Bathrooms And Breakfast,,,,,
,2123,You Can't Control The Weather. Looking Forward To Staying Again  With Hopefully Some Sunshine To Enjoy The Views :),,,,,
,2124,The Standard Of Service And Attention At Breakfast Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,2125,We Went To The Spa To Buy Some Products  But It Was Unmanned. There Was A Notice On The Desk  But I Would Expect A Spa Of This Quality To Be Fully Manned During Opening Hours.,,,,,
,2126,Long Wait For Checkout - Could The Final Bill  Be Posted Under The Room Door Overnight To Speed The Process?,,,,,
,2130,Coat Hooks Were Not Provided In The Room  Heating In The Bathroom Was Inadequate.,,,,,
,2135,Nothing But Please Never Change!,,,,,
,2136,Not That We Can Think Of.,,,,,
,2137,Being Able To Dine Everywhere/Anytime Would Really Enhance The Experience.  The Atmosphere But Particularly The Quality Of Food In The Bistro Should Be Improved.  I Personally Would Also Have Liked A Bit Of Background Music (Softly) Like Jazz Or Classical In The Bar  Restaurant And Main Seating Area (High Tea). It Would Enhance The Atmosphere.  Lastly  I Don't Appreciate Having To Pay For Good Internet Service Considering The Amount Of Money Spent At The Castle Over The Weekend. This Should Absolutely Be Included In The Stay. I Find That Very Important.,,,,,
,2140,Some Suggested Improvements 1) The Final Bill Was Difficult To Understand Due To The Split Out Of The Service Charge Which Is Not Done On The Bills In And Around The Hotel In The Bar Etc. I Was Charged Inconsistently Throughout The Hotel  It Seemed A Bit Hit And Miss And My Final Bill Was Inaccurate. 2) There Are No Lockers In The Changing Rooms  This Should Be Changed Or Explicitly Stated To Save A Trek Backwards And Forwards To The Room. 3) The Water In The Pool Could Be A A Little Warmer. 4) The Dining Options Were A Little Limited As Already Stated - Introduce A Lounge Menu. 5) Provide Some Signage To The Hotel From North Bovey.,,,,,
,2141,Staff Were Very Helpful And Friendly; Surroundings Very Pleasant - In All Reception Rooms And Landscape Was Well Maintained However There Was A Noticeable Musty Smell In The Bar Area - Suggest A Big Spring Clean  Or Steam Clean  And Update The Decor,,,,,
,2144,No,,,,,
,2148,It Was A Shame That The Sauna Was Not Working During Our 3 Day Stay. The Sign On The Door Said 'Temporarily Out Of Order' - How Long Is Temporary? Perhaps A Time Could Have Been Given  When It Would Be Operational.,,,,,
,2150,I Don't Think The Booking Should Have Included The Edwardian Grill For 2 Nights When I Had Pre-Booked The Bistro And As Mentioned Earlier I Think That Ought To Have Been Highlighted To Me At The Time I Made The Booking Or Taken Into Account With The Final Bill.  However  Other Than That We All Loved Our Stay And Will Most Definately Come Again.,,,,,
,2157,The Presentation Of The Final Account Was Hopeless Particularly If One Doesn't Have The Time To Stand There Picking Through Item After Item. In Fact I Still Don't Know Where My Bill Of Over Â£800 Came From Given That The Two Nights Room And One Dinner Had Already Been Paid For!,,,,,
,2158,Federico Was Very Responsive And Listened To Our Edwardian Grill Complaints Attentively. The Dinner Bill Was Adjusted  To Our Satisfaction  Though One Would Rather Have Had A Memorable Meal For A Special Occaission Than A Discount. As Mentioned Could Have Wished For More Of A 5Star Welcome From The Front. We Wandered Around By Ourselves To Figure Out Where Things Were. If I Hadnt Read The Hotel Binder In The Room I Wouldnt Have Known Anything.,,,,,
,2161,Met- But Food Was Not As Good As We Thought It Would Be.,,,,,
,2162,No,,,,,
,2163,Not Really,,,,,
,2164,The Filter Coffee System In The Room Wasnt Very Efficient And Messy To Prepare .    Plus I Wish Hotels Would Supply A Small Dish Receptical For The Used Satchet / T Bag Instead Of Having To Carry It Hot And Wet Over To A Bin Which In The Room@S Case Wasnt Lined For Wet Goods .,,,,,
,2165,We Needed Tooth Glasses In The Bathroom  And The Bedside Lights Were A Bit Dim To Read By.  I Realise That You Don't Want A Partner To Be Woken By A Late-Night Reader  But Maybe A Directional Light Would Do Both Jobs?,,,,,
,2166,No  We Felt As Though We Were Guests At A House Party On A Country Estate  Not In An Hotel.,,,,,
,2169,Improve The Menu In The Bistro And The Quality Of Food In The Edwardian Grill,,,,,
,2173,No Not Really.,,,,,
,2175,I Booked My Room By Phone To Ensure The Room I Wanted. I Did Not Get Shown To A Junior Suite! Slightly Embarrassing Having To Mention It On  Arrival. This Was My Third Booking & Simply Wanted The Room We Had Previously Stayed At. It Was Sorted  But Did Cause Some Anxiety As It Was A Special Celebration Weekend.  ,,,,,
,2176,As Mentioned Before: Analyse Your Service Processes At Breakfast And In The Bistro.,,,,,
,2177,Better Service In The Restaurant,,,,,
,2178,Difficult To Understand Final Account And See How The Overcharge (Above The Inclusive Meal Allowance) Had Been Calculated.,,,,,
,2182,Slight Blip With Bill But Frederico Was There And Sorted It Out Straight Away,,,,,
,2186,Difficult To Think Of Anything.  It Was Wonderful.  A Big Thank You To All The Staff.,,,,,
,2188,The Discretionary Service Charge Was Anything But  In Reality It Is Both Excessive & Mandatory  & Applied To Anything & Everything. Frankly It's Quite Appalling.,,,,,
,2192,I Would Say That The Stay Is Particularly Oriented To Entertain Men. I Missed Entertainment For Ladies.,,,,,
,2194,Not Allow Maid In Room Until Until 12.00 After We Left,,,,,
,2195,Not Really We Like To Know The History About Places - Possibly A Little More Detail On Hidden Parts Of The Building From The 'Upstairs/Downstairs' Side Would Add A Little More For International Visitors.,,,,,
,2196,Just Improve Food.,,,,,
,2198,Please See My Comments Relating To The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,2199,Service At Breakfast Was A Little Hit And Miss. The First Day Was Brilliant  The Second Was Not Very Good. The Food  Was Exceptional  But I Had To Chase For Tea/Coffee  And We Waited A While For Our Breakfasts To Arrive. We Asked For Further Toast At One Point And It Was Met With An Odd Look From One Of The Girls  Of Which Was A Bit Off Considering The Venue.  It Was Clear Something May Have Been Wrong In The Kitchen But That Translated To The Restaurant Floor- Not Ideal.,,,,,
,2201,Loading And Unloading At The Lodge Would Be Easier Without The Huge Boulders Making The Drive To It More Like An Advanced Driving Lesson Assault Course!,,,,,
,2202,Actually No-You Appear To Have Thought Of Everything!!,,,,,
,2208,Yes Please Move The Hotel Closer To Chesire Arrange For Frederico Totake Leave For My Next Visit And Buy Him A New Wardrobe,,,,,
,2209,We Were Staying In A Grand State Room For Our Tenth Wedding Anniversary Which I'd Made Clear When Booking  Both On The Phone And Again  Later In An Email. I Would Of Thought A Welcome Glass Of Champagne Would Of Been A Nice Touch Considering We Were Staying In Your Most Expensive Room And Should Of Perhaps Been Made To Feel Just A Little Bit More Special On Our Anniversary...,,,,,
,2214,No,,,,,
,2217,Some Gaps In Service Was Evident Especially In The Lounges Rather Than The Bar In The Evening.  Also Reception Took An Hour On Our First Morning To Send Up Some Fresh Milk Which Was Pretty Annoying.,,,,,
,2219,It Would Have Been Nice If We Hadn't Of Had To Move Rooms So Late And Would Have Been Good If Bovey Castle Had Thought Of This  Knowing The Disco Was Right Below Our Room.,,,,,
,2221,Bovey Rangers Was Disappointing & Very Expensive For A Short Time,,,,,
,2228,We Missed The Pianist As He Finished Earlier Than We Thought.,,,,,
,2229,Would Rather Have Tipped As We Went Along Than Have The Discretionary Service Charges As Some Members Of Staff Delivered More Than Others But You Felt You Could Not Tip Them Because Of This,,,,,
,2231,Check Out Was A Little Crazy With People Queuing So I Went And Got A Coffee Till It Died Down.,,,,,
,2236,The Whole Experience Was Lovely Topped Off With The Birds Of Prey Demonstration.  The Guy Was As Much A Star As The Birds.,,,,,
,2241,Dedicated Parking For Residents. We Went Out For A Few Hours And Had Nowhere To Park On Our Return. Golfers Had Taken All The Parking Spaces. I Ended Up Half On The Pavement Half On The Road Squeezed Up To A Golf Buggy.,,,,,
,2242,Improve The Food.,,,,,
,2246,Stayed In Room 30 And Thought The Public Stairways Were Shabby I.E.Carpet Worn,,,,,
,2247,I Do Not Like Your Approach To Applying The Service Charge. The Amount And The Decision To Provide A Gratuity Should Be Solely At My Discretion.,,,,,
,2248,Perhaps Double Glaze The Window In Room 35 Nearest To The Extractor Vent......Such A Shame ....As The Loss Of Sleep Did Take The Gloss Off Our Sunday.,,,,,
,2249,Free Wifi Would Have Been Welcome.,,,,,
,2252,Perhaps A Bit More Choice On The Room Service Menu And A Very Simple Light Choice In The Bistro Or Bar In The Evening. We Had A Late Lunch With You And Really Wanted Very Little In The Evening.,,,,,
,2255,Change The Car Parking Arrangements!,,,,,
,2257,Improve The Food In The Brasserie And Understand Adults Staying With You Do Not Want To Have To Put Up With Noisy Children And Until These Have Been Addresses We Shall Be Unlikely To Return,,,,,
,2258,It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had Some Acknowledgement From Staff With Regards To My Birthday  As That Was The Purpose Of The Weekend And My Husband Had Made Staff Aware Of This At The Time Of Booking. Also When I Was Contacted On 6Th With Reference To Any Treatments We Would Like To Book I Mentioned To Adam The Reason For Our Visit. A Candle With My Dessert Or 'Happy Birthday' In Chocolate Writing On The Dessert Plate Would Have Been Nice And Would Not Have 'Cost' Much To Do  But Would Have Added A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,2259,A ' Rooms Are Normally Ready At 3   Never Mind   Come Through To The Lounge   Sit Down   Or Go And Have Lunch And We Will Hurry Everything Along For You ' . Not ' Check In Is At 3 ' In A Tone That Made Us Feel Like Naughty School Kids .  Internet !!!! Should Be Included In The Price ( Put An Extra Fiver On Bill If Necessary ) . It Took About Half An Hour To Realise That The Free Internet Is Totally Inadequate And To Get The Code For The Paying One . Made The Hotel Seem Very Tacky .  Get A Better Mobile Signal   It's Horrid To All Huddle In A Doorway . Also I Need My Mother To Be Able To Ring Me At Any Time In My Mobile And I Felt Cross That She Couldn't  ,,,,,
,2260,No. To Be Honest I'm Not A 'Lounge About' Person But For Once That's All I Did Other Than Have A Swim. It Did Me Good And Although There Were Plenty Of Things To Do It Was Nice Just To Sit Around And Read In Great Surroundings. Time Shot By.,,,,,
,2261,We Had A Brilliant Christmas .,,,,,
,2264,No  It Was The Perfect Honeymoon!!,,,,,
,2265,Nothing  I Had A Fab Break,,,,,
,2268,See Room,,,,,
,2269,Better Room And Extra Staff. Otherwise  Nothing - We Had A Great Time!,,,,,
,2270,I Think The Prices In The Edwardian Grill Restaurant Was Slightly Excessive. The Food Was Good And Service Was Amazing But I Would Not Pay Â£34 For The Beef Wellington Again.,,,,,
,2279,Leasure Hotel. Wifi Should Be Free Particularly As There Is No Phone Signal.,,,,,
,2282,Nothing More Could Be Done. Service And Experience Was As Good As Any Hotel I Have Stayed In.,,,,,
,2283,Would Feel More Comfortable If Dogs Were Kept On Leads.  A Few More Sun Loungers And Maybe A Water Slide For The Children In Warm Weather Or Even Just Water Sprinklers On For Children To Play Under.,,,,,
,2284,Not A Thing,,,,,
,2285,It Was Slightly Unfortunate That The Final Bill Was Incorrect By Â£57  But The Reception Ladies Were Incredibly Swift And Polite In Dealing With The Discrepancy. Really No Problem  But Glad We Checked The Bill!,,,,,
,2287,I Booked A Room And Stated In The Reservation It Was A 40Th Birthday Celebration.  No One Ever Mentioned This When We Arrived Or While We Were There.  No One Thanked Us When We Left.,,,,,
,2292,The Only Criticism Would Be About The Speed Of Service For Drinks Service Both In The Lounge Areas And The Bar.  It Took A While To Be Served And Hot Drinks Were Often Luke Warm On Arrival.  During The Day There Seemed To Be A Lot Of Staff Wandering Around Being Friendly Which Was Great But They Didn't Seem To Be Taking Drinks Orders Etc.,,,,,
,2293,The Lego Boxes Are Incomplete. This Is Irrelevant To Adults But We Couldn't Build Either Of The Things The Children Chose Completely And They Were Both Disappointed. Our Daughter Suggested Having Lego Build Days Regularly When All The Kids Staying Are Invited To Build All The Sets And Sort Them Out.,,,,,
,2294,Slightly Wider Food Selection On The Bar Menu.,,,,,
,2296,I Was Slightly Confused About The Service Charge Which Was Added Onto The Accomodation Part Of My Bill. I Assumed I Had Paid In Full For The Accomodation A Few Months Prior  So Was Surprised To Have The Additional Service Charge Added On Departure. This Should Be Made More Explicit On Booking.,,,,,
,2300,The Breakfast Staff Seemed Quite Disorganised: Nobody To Greet Us On Arrival  No Butter  Had To Ask For Tea,,,,,
,2301,Just Improve The Dining Experience!,,,,,
,2305,More Staff During Dinner. Breakfast Was Disappointing. No Vegetarian Sausages Available  Toast Arrived Cold  Had To Ask For Butter Alternative Twice Before It Arrived  Wrong Drink Served And Husband's Bacon Was Overcooked.,,,,,
,2309,Don't Add Discretionary Charge. Instead Allow Us To Do This At The Table. Sort Out The Breakfasts As  They Fell Way Below What Would Be  Expected From Such A High Class Establishment. Also The Corridors Upstairs Smelt Of Smoke As Though The Fires Weren't Drawing Properly. We Loved The Open Fires Though,,,,,
,2310,Better Service At Breakfast.,,,,,
,2312,Overall Our Experience Was Much Improved On A Previous Stay. There Were Still Slight Weaknesses Like Delivering The Wrong Bottle Of Wine Which Isnt The Biggest Crime But When You Have A Baby Sleeping In The Same Room Two Disturbances By Room Service Could Be Avoided.,,,,,
,2313,No It Was So Brilliant Out Boys Want To Live There Permanently!,,,,,
,2314,No,,,,,
,2316,I Felt Overall That The Atmosphere Wasn't As Welcoming As Previously And Also The Staff Were Not As Amenable Or Friendly As On A Previous Visit.,,,,,
,2320,Make Room Grades Easier To Understand. Upgrade Poor Quality Bathrooms.,,,,,
,2329,The Pool Changing Rooms Need Updating  It Would Be Nice To Have Lockers. The Gym Felt Like A Few Bits Of Equipment Put In A Living Room  Not Inviting. The Pool Was Too Cold.,,,,,
,2330,No Everything Was Catered For And Perfect.  Job Well Done!!!,,,,,
,2336,Having Booked For Three Nights  I Did Enquire Whether It Might Be Possible To Stay For A Fourth Night  And I Wondered Whether Any Concession Might Be Offered (To Encourage Us To Stay). However  Only The Full One-Night Room Rate Was Quoted  And There Seemed No Room For Negotiation  So We Did Not Stay The Extra Night.,,,,,
,2338,Bovey Castle Is Marketed As Luxury  It Is Definitely Not. On The Hottest Day Of The Year Thus Far We Were Quite Disappointed To Find That There Was No Air Conditioning.,,,,,
,2340,A Wipeable Mat To Put The Dogs Bowls On,,,,,
,2343,Service At Breakfast On Second Day Was Very Slow,,,,,
,2344,Internet Improved Please  And Service In The Grill.,,,,,
,2346,Better Maintained Lodge   Better Service Proposition In The Bistro More Reasonably Priced Baby Sitting And Kids Activities. Lockers At The Pool And Larger Changing Facilities Would Be An Improvement,,,,,
,2348,There Are Serious Issues Re Service In The Bistro. We Were Embarrased In Front Of Friends To Whom We Had Recommended The Hotel.  We Would Have Spent More Money If The Ambience And Service Had Met Our Expectations. There Is A Serious Need For Attention Here.,,,,,
,2351,The Menu In The Bistro Could Be Improved.. It Was Very Cafã© Ish.,,,,,
,2355,Please See Comment Above Re. Heating.,,,,,
,2357,Lack Of Mobile Signal Was Very Inconvinient,,,,,
,2358,No,,,,,
,2359,Not That Comes To Mind,,,,,
,2362,Room Size Was Disappointing And There Was No Mention Of Use Of The Spa Facilities,,,,,
,2364,Didn't Realise It Was Discretionary.  This Wasn't Made Clear.  No Problem  I Would Have Still Paid But Would Have Been Nice To Have This Pointed Out At Time Of Paying (Verbally!),,,,,
,2365,Nothing,,,,,
,2366,Our Experince Of Our Stay Was Outstanding And We Will Return To Bovey Castle Without A Doubt. We Have Stayed In Many Magnificant Hotels Around The World And Bovey Castle Deserves Its Inclusion In Our List Of Preferred Hotels To Stay. There Is Always Room For Improvement (My Mother Told Me It The Biggest One In The House!!).  Little Things Such As Setting Out The Tables In The Lounges For Afternoon Tea Made Us Feel That We Could Not Just Sit At A Table That Was Laid Out. We Felt That It Would Be Better If The Tables Were Not Set Up And Let Guests Sit Down Without Feeling Obligated That They Have To Order Afternoon Tea. If Guests Decide To Have Afternoon Tea  Then The Tables Can Be Set Out.,,,,,
,2367,Nothing Beyond What Has Been Noted  The Staff Were Wonderfull  The Grounds Are Nice (Although As A Disabled Person I Was Restricted To The Balcony),,,,,
,2368,The Food Was Only Average And The Produce Was Not The Best Quality Ie Our Steaks Were Tough. Staff Did Not Always Understand Our Requests In The Dining Rooms And The Eggs Were Always Over Cooked At Breakfast.,,,,,
,2371,The Tub Showers In The Lodges Need Shower Curtains!,,,,,
,2372,Not Really - A Lovely 2 Night Treat (4Th And 5Th April 2012),,,,,
,2374,Poor Service In The Bistro Bar. Should Not Charge For Service On Everything  Especially A Badly Served Drink At The Bar.!!,,,,,
,2377,As A Female Lone Driver I Found The Last Few Miles Leading Upto The Castle A Little Nerve Wracking And Was Not Anticipating Such A Drive.  Luckily I Was Travelling During Daylight Hours. I Am Not Sure What You Can Do To Pre Warn Nervous Drivers Of This Fact!,,,,,
,2387,We Were Moved To One Of The Lodges From Rose Cottage. The Lodge Was Very Comfortable However There Were A Few Minor Issues. We Pointed These Out To The Reception Staff As We Left.  We Really Enjoyed The Falconry Display.  We Found The Activities Available On A Daily Basis To Be Quite Repetitive And Also Very Expensive.,,,,,
,2389,Bikes Would Have Been Enjoyable. Sample Menus From The Castle Restaurants Would Have Been Helpful.,,,,,
,2390,The Breakfast Room And Cooked Meal Was Cooler Than I Would Have Liked,,,,,
,2399,The Room Rates Etc Should Show The Final Price We'll Be Paying  It Was Unpleasant To See In Bill All The Extra Service Charges & Vat On Top Of It  As Long As Customers Know The Final Price They Are Going To Pay In Advance Then Everyone Would Be Happy,,,,,
,2401,Only The Provision Of An Effective Internet Connection. You Must Sort This.,,,,,
,2402,The Only Negative In The Whole Three Days Was When Dining In The Edwardian Grill On Our Last Night. We Left It Till Then As We Felt It Would Be A Fitting End To A Lovely Stay. We Were A Little Bit Disappointed To Wait 40 Minutes For Our Wine To Be Served  It Just Would Have Been Nice If Someone Had Apologised  And If There Was A Problem With Our Choice We Would Have Been More Than Happy To Accept An Alternative!,,,,,
,2403,The Service In The Bar Is Not As Good As It Could Be  Especially If You Cannot Sit With In The Immediate Bar Area. Trying To Get Served Then Is Very Difficult.,,,,,
,2404,Two Things That You Might Consider...  1- Have A Lounge Set Aside For Guests Who Want To Relax In A Lounge   Have A Sandwich But Who Do Not Want A Cream/ Afternoon Tea.  2 - Have An Area In The Edwardian Grill That Is Set Aside For Couples Away From Families. We Were At A Table Between Two Large Family Tables With Children Who Were Noisy.,,,,,
,2407,Please See Comments In The Dining Section  Unfortunately The Dining Experience Let The Hotel Down  Attention To Detail Was Missing  Not What Was Expected Of A Hotel Of This Quality.  We Were Not Asked At Any Point During Our Stay Whether Everything Was Ok  Even On Checking Out At Reception  I Did Voice The Issues That We Had But All The Receptionist Said Was That She Would Pass On The Comments To The Manager  She Did Not Even Offer An Apology Or Ask If We Wished To Decline The Service Charge.,,,,,
,2408,We Loved The Walks Around The Castle It Would Be Nice If Some New Walks Could Be Added,,,,,
,2409,Just Small Touches That Would Make A Good Experience Great. E.G. Providing Accompaniments To Drinks In The Bar  Free Wi Fi  Cutlery Without Dishwasher Marks In The Bistro Etc.,,,,,
,2410,Get A New Chef  In The Bistro!,,,,,
,2411,No. Overall A Very Good Experience And One I Hope To Repeat,,,,,
,2412,Possibly - Board Games Available For Use In 1 Of The Lounges Or Designated Area For Evenings Or Particularly Bad Weather.,,,,,
,2414,The Falconry Display Did Not Take Place As The Falconer Was Unavailable.,,,,,
,2415,Second Time In The Oak Room Restaurant And Members Felt It Was Not 5 Start Service (3 Star ). The White Wine Was Not Really Chilled ! The Reply Was ' Well Its Come Out Of The Chiller '.What About Let Me Get You An Ice Bucket? The Chicken Dish Was Described As Average . My Beef Wellington Was Perfect But Got Cold Waiting For The Veg.,,,,,
,2418,I Recommend You Completely Re-Model The Bistro Which Always Smelt Of Stale Food (Yuk -We Couldn't Eat In There) Was Too Large And Characterless - A Real Contrast To The Wonderful Public Rooms In The Remainder Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,2419,Your Mobile Hot Spot Was A Great Service Given We Were Changing Plans At Short Notice. Perhaps It Could Be Installed In The Old Telephone Booths. But Please Not Throughout The Public Rooms It Was A Delight To Be Free.,,,,,
,2421,Done Away With The Music That Was Played In The Lounges. It Wasnt Necessary As It Was So Peaceful And Spoilt The Atmosphere.,,,,,
,2422,A Very Clean And Well Run Hotel In A Beautiful Location.,,,,,
,2432,Our Disappointments Were Related To The Food And Heating Aspects  Both Vital For Comfort! Pools Of Condensation On The Bedroom Window Ledges Were Soaked Up By Our Toiletry Bags.  During Breakfast  We Ordered Traditional English....Both Eggs Were Very Overdone And I Had To Eventually Get Up And Find A Waiter To Ask For Our Toast/ Coffee.,,,,,
,2434,Having Lunched Here A Couple Of Times Before  We Had A Good Idea Of What To Expect. Better And More Varied Food In The Bistro Would Have Enhanced The Experience.,,,,,
,2435,Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,
,2437,No - I Just Wish We Had Had Time To Sit In Front Of One Of Your Fires And Admire The Grounds - Still There Is Always Next Time.,,,,,
,2440,We Had To Check Out First Thing In The Morning To Catch A Train And Was Not Asked For The Room Key Which I Had In A Pocket. Since Returned. The Cooked Buffet Breakfast At 7.30Am Could Have Been A Lot Warmer  Particularly The Bacon Which Was Luke Warm At Best,,,,,
,2441,None,,,,,
,2449,We Expected A Lot And You Delivered Extremely Well  So Thank You All.,,,,,
,2450,Because A Mobile Can Not Be Used The Swithchboard Could Use A Little Training.Very Polite But Seemed Unable To Handle Some Basic Questions.,,,,,
,2454,Except For Our Prior Comments Regarding The Room And Food Menus  We Found Bovey Castle To Be A Relaxing And Satisfying Experience.,,,,,
,2462,No  Everything Was Spot On.,,,,,
,2466,See Previous Comments,,,,,
,2467,We Were Not Advised Of The Large And Noisey Private Party And Most Of My Colleagues Did Not Sleep. I Believe That We Should Have Been Told And We Would Not Have Stayed.  I Am Still Awaiting An Email From The Manager About This,,,,,
,2468,Hopefully We Will Get The Bedroom Right Next Time!,,,,,
,2471,The Only Disappointing Part Of Our Stay Was The Food In The Evening. The Room Service Always Forgot Something.,,,,,
,2472,Reduce The Price!,,,,,
,2476,Something Like A Welcome Drink. Also The Fudge In The Room... There Was 1 Small Packet And 2 Guests So That Wasnt Great.  The Service At Breakfast Needs To Be Attentive - It Was Poor On My First Morning.,,,,,
,2480,Lived Up To The Standards Portrayed,,,,,
,2485,Increase The Expectations And Training Of Staff  And Employ More Of Them - Bovey Has The Raw Ingredients To Be One Of The Best Country Hotels In The Uk But Due To The Poor Staff It Is Badly Let Down.  I'd Pay Â£400+ Per Night To Stay At Bovey If It Had The Right Level Of Staff (As I Do At Limewood  Coworth Park Etc...) But At Present I'll Only Stay At Bovey When They Have Deals On The Room Prices  Otherwise It Just Makes Me Cross When I'm Constantly Let Down.,,,,,
,2490,The Service Charge Did Not Feel Discretionary And If I Could Have Been Bothered I May Have Questioned It More When I Felt The Service Was Lacking Particularly In Dining Situations.,,,,,
,2501,Staff Need Training And To Smile,,,,,
,2504,Adding The Service Charge To The Room Charge Feels Unnecessary And Leaves A Slightly Uncomfortable Taste At The Point Of Departure (Although Reception Staff Removed It Absolutely Without Issue On Request). Room Service Was Very Slow - At One Point We Had To Phone Again And There Was No Record Of The Original Call.,,,,,
,2505,Service Was Slow When Eventually Arrived. There Was A Feeling Between Other Guests That A Group In The Hotel Was Receiving All The Attention And The Other Guests Were Treated As Second Rate.,,,,,
,2510,The Service Charge Was Not Made Optional To Us. We Were Offended That This Was Not Made Optional To Us. My Bag Has Been Stolen  The Room Was Not Five Star Specification And The Restaurant Service Was Well Below What Expected In Such A Refined Restaurant.,,,,,
,2512,Room Could Have Been Better. Was Told It Was An Upgrade But Dubious Based On The Condition Of The Room. The Spa Treatment Was A Waste Of Time And Better Therapists Should Be Used.,,,,,
,2515,No; We Had A Superb Stay And Really Enjoyed Every Minute.  Thank You!,,,,,
,2518,There Are Many 'Luxury' Hotels And Whilst The Setting Was Stunning I Felt My Overall Experience Fell Below What I've Experienced At Similarly Priced Hotels Around The World. As The Owner Of Resorts And Hotels Myself My Biggest Suggestion Would Be To Ensure The Basics Are Right; Service Is Good  Food Is Hot When Delivered (It Wasn't) And Above All That Bedrooms You Charge 300-500 A Night For Don't Have Stained Carpets  Threadbare Carpets  Bad Stains On Bathroom Blinds.,,,,,
,2521,Improved Quality Of Food  Service At Afternoon Tea  And Expertise Of Spa Therapist,,,,,
,2523,Mobile Phones Were Totally Out Of Use And We Had To Rely On Wifi In The Castle. When Outside The Castle  There Is No Way To Get Connected To Others. This Is Very Very Inconvenient. ,,,,,
,2524,Nothing - I Can't Wait To Return!,,,,,
,2526,The Hotel Only Met My Epxectations As I Purchased The Hotel Room At A Discount.  I Would Not Pay Full Price For It.  We Were Also Very Unhappy That The Hotel Suggested Charging Â£10 One Way For A Drop To The Ring Of Bells Inn Which Is A 5 Min Drive Round The Corner And They Emphasised That It Would Be In One Of The Jags.  I Don't Think We Cared What Car We Got To The Venue In But It Would Have Been A Good Gesture For The Hotel To Charge A More Reasonable Price To Take Us To The Pub.,,,,,
,2527,I Think There Were A Few Niggly Bits - I Would Not Have Been Happy With My Overall Stay If I Was Paying Full Price.  I Didn't Pay The Full Price As I Booked A Discounted Deal With Secret Escapes So I Was Happy With The Service And Quality Of Stay In Relation To What I Paid.  I Was Also Quite Surprised By The Cost The Hotel Proposed To Drive Us To The Ring Of Bells Inn Where We Had A Dinner Reservation.  The Cost Was Â£10 One Way For A Pub Which Is Literally Round The Corner.,,,,,
,2529,Fix The Heating! The Temperature In The Hotel Throughout Our Stay Was Way Too High. Some Very Basic Mistakes Are Being Made In Food Service Despite Staff Being Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,2530,Would Love To Come Back If Thought Our Service In The Restaurants Was A One Off And Just A Bad Day  But Really Not Up To The Room Rates / Star Ratings Of Bovey,,,,,
,2535,No Was Amazing  Can Not Wait To Return In The Future,,,,,
,2538,We Found The Public Rooms Very Quiet During The Day.  Perhaps Some Low Level Background Music Would Help?,,,,,
,2540,Improve The Dining Experience. The Food Was Excellent  But The Room Arrangent And Decor Let It Down Somewhat. Individual Serving Staff Were Professional  But The Restaurant Lacked The Presence Of A  Sommelier Or Maitre D' One Would Expect To Match The Food On Offer.,,,,,
,2542,Free Wi-Fi  Bistro Open After 9Pm On A Sunday.,,,,,
,2545,Although I Appreciate The Sentiment Behind The Service Charges I Couldn't Help But Feel Taken Advantage Of. We Were Already Paying Premium Prices For Our Stay So To Have Addtional Costs Added For No Tangible Reason Tainted The Experience And Left A Bit Of A Bitter After Taste. Many Other Establishments Have This Issue And None Charge An Automatic Service Charge On Everything  This Would Be Enough To Put Me Off Visiting Again  So This Needs Evaluating In My Opinion.,,,,,
,2546,Champagne Should Be Served At 3 Degrees And The Food In The Bistro Could Be Much Improved It Is Very Poor And The Fact That There Is No Lamb Or Chicken On The Edwardian Grill Menu Leaving Only Fish Or Beef Is Very Poor,,,,,
,2547,Some More Easily Understood Detail On The Final Account Would Be Good As Having Things Just Coded As Beverage For Example Can Be A Bit Of A Pain.  Not Sure What The Answer Is  But You Do Find Yourself Thinking 'What Did I Have Three Days Ago For Something Which Just Says Beverage?',,,,,
,2549,The Venue Is Beautiful But Level Of Service Left A Lot To Be Desired Which Has Affected The Overall Experience Of Myself And Many Other Guests Of The Wedding. It Is Really In The Attention To Detail. There Is So Much Hype Over Bovey Castle And How Prestigious It Is So Expectations Were High But Were Certainly Not Met On This Occasion.,,,,,
,2555,Arrange Better Weather,,,,,
,2556,The Service Charges Did Not Appear To Be Discretionary. In Particular  Adding A 5% Service Change Onto A Pre-Paid Room Is Outrageous. If It Had Been Explained That It Was Discretionary  We Would Not Have Paid It. Also It Appears That A Service Charge Was Added At Checkout To Bills That Already Contained A Service Charge,,,,,
,2557,There Is Always Something That Goes Wrong  Two Previous Visits We Had Problems As Well And These Are Well Documented With The Manager. This Time The Tv Went Down On The Second Day Of The Euro Football(Sat) Sunday Back On Though Hooray!!!,,,,,
,2558,There Was A Wedding Party There On Our Saturday Night  They Rather Took Over A Large Part Of The Oak Bar And Made The Experience Less Cosy And Comfortable For Hotel Guests.,,,,,
,2560,As The Room Did Not Meet Our Expectations   A Complimentary Upgrade Would Have Been Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,2562,Nothing  Thank You,,,,,
,2568,My Grandchildren Would Have Loved A Pool Or Snooker Table.,,,,,
,2569,About The Bill We Were On A Travel Zoo When The Bill Came Up Could Not Understand How They Took Off Sandwiches And Tea  On Dinner Menus Could Not Understand It But Paid It Felt Embrassed,,,,,
,2570,Only In Regard To Earlier Comments In This Feedback.,,,,,
,2572,No,,,,,
,2575,No,,,,,
,2578,Your Over All Service Was Very Satisfactory.,,,,,
,2579,Have Lunch And Dinner Menus In The Bistro,,,,,
,2581,When There Is Group Check In  More Attention Should Be Made As To Where Each Luggage Goes To Which Room,,,,,
,2583,Please Ensure Tea Is Hot And Not So Weak  Both At Afternoon Tea And Breakfast Not Told About The Buffet At Breakfast  Just Presented With An A La Carte Menu  And Didn't Know Whether Items On There Were Included In Our Rate,,,,,
,2585,Did Not Realise That The Service Charge Was Discretionary Thought It Was Compulsory So Quite Annoyed By This Fact And  Perhaps This Could Have Been Made Clearer From The Outset,,,,,
,2594,See Previous Comments.,,,,,
,2603,A Plan Guide To Find Out Where Facilities Are Located.,,,,,
,2606,Better Food,,,,,
,2610,Train The Staff In The Hotel Better.,,,,,
,2612,Keep The Big Christmas Tree In The Cathedral Room Up Till Jan 6!,,,,,
,2613,Yes. I  Very Surprised The Manager Did Not Even Introduce Himself To Us. After All We Took Five Rooms!!,,,,,
,2614,All Ready Mentioned In My Previous Comments.,,,,,
,2616,Fruit Or Flowers In The Room Would Add A Welcoming Touch.,,,,,
,2617,Given Your Prices It Seems Ridiculous That You Charge For Internet Access. In My Experience Very Few Quality Hotels Charge For This Service....Better To Simply Add A Small Increase To All Room Bills. Also The Internet Service Was Slow,,,,,
,2618,Tennis Courts Still Badly Need Resurfacing,,,,,
,2619,Yes  Ensure We Had A Good Nights Sleep In A Decent Room And Let Us Dine In Decent Surroundings.,,,,,
,2621,See Previous Comments,,,,,
,2623,Improve The Standard Of Food In The Bistro,,,,,
,2624,Better Trained Staff - Breakfast Situation Was Not Coped With At All Well - Large Party In Hotel Meant We Were Moved From Room To Room And Had A Very Poor Breakfast Experience As A Result.   Poor Food Also.   Poor Staff Did Not Seem To Know How To Deal With This - Apart From One.,,,,,
,2627,We Had Our Dog With Us And He Was Kept Under Control At All Times.   There Were However Guests Staying With A Large Number Of Dogs Who Did Not Keep Them Under Control And Allowed Them To Roam At Will.   I Was Harrassed By These Dogs When Walking With Our Dog On A Lead On More Than One Occasion And Did Feel Threatened By Them.   I Realise It Is Difficult To Manage This Kind Of Situation.,,,,,
,2632,The Welcome At Our Arrival Was Rather Poor,,,,,
,2633,Substantially Redesign The Bistro,,,,,
,2635,Heating Excess  Bed Problems  Toilet Problem Mentioned,,,,,
,2636,Is It Possible To Improve Mobile Phone Signals? Seems Odd That A Hotel Of Your Quality Can't Access Mobile Network. It Was Important For Me To Stay In Contact With Someone During My Stay And I Could Not Do So.,,,,,
,2637,No.,,,,,
,2638,Just To Have Had Our Dining Experience Improved,,,,,
,2640,No,,,,,
,2641,Better Menues To Bistro And Grill,,,,,
,2642,We Were On A Special Break And Came Away Disappointed With Many Aspects Of The Hotel. The Golf Was Excellent And The Course Was As We Expected  But This Was Tarnished By All Of The Problems We To Contend With In The Hotel.,,,,,
,2643,Tennis Courts Badly Needs Resurfacing,,,,,
,2647,Better Service In The Restaurant. More Teabags  Only 2 Teabags (Excluding Fruit Tea) And Had To Request More. Silly Storage Arrangement For Cups Etc; Every Time We Opened The Storage Box The Saucers Fell Out!,,,,,
,2648,Paint Peeling On The Window Mullions And Damp Patches In The Wallpaper Tar The Image Of The Hotel. Rethink Those Coffee Pouches In The Refreshments Box Please  They Are Well Intentioned But Not At All Practical With Your Cups.,,,,,
,2651,See Letter In Post,,,,,
,2652,Comments Already Made About The Bedroom Security  Newspaper And Television. Might Be Nice To Have A Welcome Note In The Room On Arrival  And Possibly A Small Drink.  Other Hotels We Use Offer A Glass Of Sherry  And Those In Scotland Either Sherry Or Whisky.,,,,,
,2659,I Believe That The Quality Of The Sausages And Bacon At Breakfast Could Be Improved - The Bacon Was Tough  So Too The Skins On The Sausages.,,,,,
,2662,The Whole Experience The Second Time Around Was Acceptable. But Not To The High Standards We Had Expected.,,,,,
,2663,If You Could Arrange The Sun To Be Out Would Be Great   But Even Without It Is Still An Excellent Place To Stet With Lots Of Activities To Get Involved In.,,,,,
,2664,Perhaps Be More Prepared For A Large Group Like Ours With Regard To Accurate Charges. See Below.,,,,,
,2667,The Tv In The Room Was Slow Or Failed To Respond To The Remote  There Was No Provision For Radio Four  The Bbc I Player Did Not Work Due To Bandwidth.,,,,,
,2668,The Swimming Pool Was Our Real Criticism  At 5.30 The Kids Were Supposed To Be Out Of The Pool  6.30 They Were Still In There  Jumping On Each Others Shoulders.And Shouting.  I Reported This To Receptiom/ On Lst Day.   Then On 2Nd Day  As I Was Going Down To The Pool. I Could Hear The Shouting And Screaming.  I Went Back To Reception And Told Them   With That  When I Was In Pool A Lady Came Down  And Spoke To Them  When She Had Gone  The Jumped Straight Into The Pool And Started Again. Saying Nobody Tells Me What To Do.   My Father Has Paid A Lot Of Money For All Of Us To Be There  And We Shall Do What We Want  They Obviously Knew That I Had Complained.  The Pool Man Came In And I Mentoned This To Him About The Kids He Said That These Kids Will Be There For A Week. He Said That He Would Look In  The Pool Tomorrow  But We Would Have Been Gone.,,,,,
,2670,Yes: Give Exact Instructions How To Get There. It Was Quite A Challenge. Apart From That: You Are Running A Great Hotel. It Was Wonderful To Be There  We Will Be Back. We Particularly Appreciated The Dog Hospitality  Very Thoughtful.,,,,,
,2676,Reducing The Price Of The Lodges By 50% Made Them Just About Affordable For Us  And As Far As We Were Concerned Claret Tor Was Worth Every Penny. However We Thought We Were On A Self-Catering Basis So Were Surprised To Find Some Provisions In The Fridge. If They Should Not Have Been There Thank You Very Much!! - But If They Are Normally Provided Presumably We Missed The Note On This When We Booked.,,,,,
,2678,No,,,,,
,2682,Nothing At All,,,,,
,2689,Brasserie Serving Steaks Would Have Beenour Request.,,,,,
,2695,I Asked The Receptionist To Remove The Extortionate 12.5% Service Charge Of Drinks And Food Which I Feel Is Appalling And Unacceptable. I Was Prepared To Pay The 5% Spa Service Charge.  Quite Honestly We Feel You Do Your Staff A Disservice By Charging Such A High Service Charge Which Left A Nasty Taste In The Mouth As We Left.  With Your Exceedingly High Charges You Should Be Able Remunerate Your Staff Appropriately And Not Even Ask Guests To Contribute To Anything But Exceptional Service!,,,,,
,2700,The Kitchen Is The Only Real Weak Point.,,,,,
,2703,I Think As We Were At Bovey Less Than 24 Hours There Is Nothing Much Else To Say. Overall I Left Feeling Disappointed As We Were Celebrating Our 10 Year Wedding Anniversary. We Have Stayed And Eaten At Many Beautiful Places Arond England Including The Chewton Glenn And The Waterside Inn And For The Money You Charged Me You Fell Way Short. In Fact I Feel Ripped Off !!,,,,,
,2707,We Stay Every New Year And Will Come Again  However The Edwardian Restaurant And Sound System For The Band Could Be Improved - Fireworks Always Excellent.,,,,,
,2712,Sort Out The Kitchen/Dining Experience And Redecorate And The Hotel Will Be Worth What I Paid For It.,,,,,
,2718,We Think Some Of The New Foreign Staff Need A Bit More Training In The Dining Area Regarding Attention To Detail  They Were However All Very Courteous And Anxious To Get It Right,,,,,
,2720,I Noted That Some Things Were No Longer Provided Compared To My Last Visit In 2010.  There Were No Mayonaise/Ketchup In The Fridge And The Keyring Mini Torches That Used To Sit In The Bedroom Were No Longer Provided.  Also  Some Additional Crockery Would Have Been Useful (I.E. Cups And Saucers Instead Of Mugs Only) And We Could Not Find A Guide To The Tv Channels.,,,,,
,2727,More Than Anything  Attend To Housekeeping And Maintenance - You Charge 5 Star Prices And Deliver 3 Star Cleanliness.  The Wedding Issue Is Also A Problem - I Understand That Weddings Are A Key Revenue Driver And I Actually Respect That - But Some Of The Public Rooms Should Remain Available For Everyone  And Those That Are Not Should Only Be Unavailable For The Day Of The Wedding - Not The Day Before And/Or After As We Experienced.,,,,,
,2729,We Had Poor Experience Of The Oak Bar.  Staff Just Not Professional Enough And On One Night We Left After 10 Mins Having Been Given A Wine List But No One Taking Our Order.  On A Couple Of Occasions We Asked In Person At Reception For Luggage Assistance And Help With Telephone But None Was Forthcoming,,,,,
,2738,The Confusion Concerning The Room Originally Reserved Was A Disappointment. The Manager Was Able To Address The Matter But Had An Acceptable Alternative Been Unavailable  I Am Sure We Would Have Sought An Alternative Venue For Our Accommodation.,,,,,
,2746,As Previously Stated  Room Was Hot & Noisy From Pool Extractor Fan. Food Was Just Ok,,,,,
,2752,Being Offered An Upgrade  If One Had Been Available  Would Have Made Our Stay Even Better For Our Special Occasion.,,,,,
,2753,No We Had A Wonderfully Relaxing Break,,,,,
,2754,Better View From Room.,,,,,
,2755,The Turn Down Service Offered At 6Pm When My Husband And I Were Showering And Getting Ready For Dinner Wasn't Convenient. Our Favourite Hotel  Lewtrenchard Manor Carries This Out When Guests Are At Dinner Which Is A Lovely Touch.,,,,,
,2761,Yes Breakfast  At A Reasonable Pace.  Tea And Coffee Generally Come Shortly After You Are Seated Followed By Toast If You Decided To Have It  With Butter And Marmalade.  Having Waited 10 Mins To Be Seated We Were Shown To A Table That Had Been Laid Up But That Was Still Surrounded By Half Cleared Tables ( No It Wasn't Particularly Busy).  The Eggy Bread That I Had Not Ordered Arrived After 20Mins  The Eggs Benedict That I Had Ordered Arrived After Another 20 Mins  The Tea And Coffee Arrived Halfway Through The Eggs Bendict ( But By Then My Partner Had Finished His Breakfast Some 30Mins Before  As He Ate From The Buffet). The Toast Did Arrive But Sadly No Butter Or Marmalade.  The Funny Things Is The Staff Looked Like Headless Chickens  They Appeared To Be Busy But If You Actually Watch What They Were Doing  They Were Achieving No More Than Wearing The Carpet Out ! I'd Sack The Lot Of Them And Employ People That Actually Want To Work Rather Than Just Giving The Appearance Of Working.,,,,,
,2777,The Location Of Bovey Castle Is Superb And Indeed Well Worth Seeing But The Actual Decoration Inside The Building Leaves A Lot To Be Desired  It Is Well Below The Standard That I Would Expect.,,,,,
,2779,Please Make Sure That Tea Is Served Hot And Not Weak Or Lukewarm At Afternoon Tea And Breakfast!,,,,,
,2789,Availability Of Bar Staff Very Poor Post Dinner. Dinner Served Late.,,,,,
,2794,I Would Suggest Investing Some Time And Money In The Bedrooms,,,,,
,2796,See Food Comments,,,,,
,2802,Bovey Is An Undermanaged And Becoming An Under Invested Hotel.  We Paid For Two Couples To Stay In State Rooms For Your New Years Eve Celebration.  It Was Hugely Disappointing.  The Carpets Are Stained  The Hotel Is Not Clean Throughout.  When We Walked Into Empty Public Rooms The Carpets Were Littered With Crumbs And The Table Tops Were Dirty.  Staff Stood Around In The Meantime Chatting And Doing Nothing.  The Standards Are Very Poor,,,,,
,2805,The Flooring In The Bathroom Was A Little Unexpected And Not So Comfortable On The Feet...,,,,,
,2806,Get A Reputation For Exellent Food And Keep Traing The Staff To The Highest Level  And The Rest Is Good,,,,,
,2809,We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome And Overall All Departments Were Not Lacking,,,,,
,2817,Many Of Your Staff Try Very Hard To Maintain The High Standards Of Such A Top Establishment  But I Was Disappointed That In The Dining Room  And Particularly At Breakfast Time  Some Of The Younger Male Staff Took No Pride At All In Their Appearance And Were Much Poorer Than Their Colleagues In Their Service. I Wanted To Tell Them That They Owed It To Their Their Colleagues As Much As The Guests  To Make The Effort Necessary To Maintain Standards. But If Not  Go Work In The Chip Shop Where Such Standards May Be Accepted. (Sorry  But It Did Annoy Me At The Time ),,,,,
,2818,See Above Comments Regarding Room,,,,,
,2827,I Have A Minor Gripe. Our Package Included Breakfast Both Mornings  So I Was A Little Disappointed To See That We Had Been Charged A Surplus Simply Because One Of Us Had Chosen A 16.95 Breakfast Instead Of 14.95. Having Spent £1 400 In The Hotel Over The Weekend   Quiblling Over 2 Pound Seemed A Little Petty To Me. Perhaps A Choice Of Breakfasts All At The Same Price   Included In The Package Would Avoid This Issue.,,,,,
,2829,I Was Asked When I Booked If It Was A Special Occassion And I Did Tell Then It Was Our Anniversary (40Th!) It Would Have Been Nice To Maybe Have Had A Small Arrangement Of Flowers Or A Glass Of Wine In Our Room.  Never The Less It Was A Lovely Break In A Lovely Hotel.,,,,,
,2833,Boxing Day Buffet Was Confusing  Perhaps Cold Meats  Salad  Baked Potatoes With Pickles Next Time?,,,,,
,2841,Didnt Like The Reserved Tables On The Lounges As We Didn't Know What Times They Were Reserved From Whereas If The Time Was Included On The Reserved Card We Maybe Could Have Enjoyed The View Over A Quick Drink. We Were Shown Into The Library And The Private Booking Sign Was Not Removed So No One Else Joined Us! Also There Was No Member Of Staff I'm The Pool/Gym Area. Being A Bit Short I Couldn't Turn On The Tv  So Had To Wait Until A Member Of Staff Was Passing Through The Gym. The Corridor Carpets To Our Wing Were Very  Very Poor. Very Disappointed With The Overall Quality Of Finish At The Hotel. Overall Value For Money At The Hotel - Very Poor.,,,,,
,2842, When It Is Cold  There Should Be Roaring Fires Not Just Burning Low In The Fire Place.,,,,,
,2848,Improve The Bistro!,,,,,
,2853,A Priority For The Hotel Must Be To Stop The Fire Place In The Main Hall From Smoking  As It Stopped Us From Sitting In There.,,,,,
,2865,Attention To Details   Follow Clients Requests,,,,,
,2866,Spare Clothing For Customers Who Forget To Bring Gym/Swimwear Etc Would Be A Plus.,,,,,
,2880,As The Booking Was Under My Girlfriend's Name (And The Proposal Was A Surprise)  I Had Had Conversations With The Front Desk That They Might Have Been Able To Upgrade Us On Arrival. Unfortunately That Didn't Happen But Our Room Was Great Anyway.  Also Our Bill Was Wrong  We Were Charged For The Champagne Twice  Luckily We Spotted It Before Departure.,,,,,
,2884,Sometimes Service In The Bar Was Quite Slow.,,,,,
,2916,Superb   We Have Stayed In Hotels All Over The World And This Rates In The Top 3.,,,,,
,2974,Housekeeping Knocked On The Door At 8.30 One Morning To Service The Room  Which Was Not Received Well.,,,,,
,2980,Better Phone Ignal,,,,,
,3041,All Was Great.,,,,,
,3065,We Don't Think So !!,,,,,
,3078,Im Sorry But Like I Said Before I Have Found Out That 2 Cards Have Been Stolen. I Also Had £100 Cash In My Wallet Which Was Not Stolen.,,,,,
,3114,I Mentioned This The Last Time We Stayed  Is The Piped Music In The Bistro Really Needed  If So Perhaps The Sound Level Should Not Be So Intrusive,,,,,
,3115,We Had Extra Drinks On Our Bill  Better Organising Of This Process Would Help.  However  We Did Have A Fabulous Stay And Will Be Back.,,,,,
,3705,Breakfast Was The Only Let Down.  No One Asked Me If I Wanted Tea/Coffee  The Bread Was Still Frozen And Service Was Slow.,,,,,
,3707,We Had Been Awarded Membership And Were Under The Impression That We Would Recieve More Information About Our Membership On Arrival Including Membership Cards.  We Did Not Receive This And It Was Not Clear On Our Booking That We Were New Members.,,,,,
,3709,We Didn't  Pay The Whole Service Charge  Rather An Amount We Felt Appropriate. One Thing I Didn't Expect Was To Be Told The Service Charge Went Towards Things Like Staff Motivational Days And Such Which I Would Have Hoped Would Be Subbed By The Business Anyway. I'd Have Thought They Would All Rather A Cut Of The Service Charge Pot At The End Of The Year As A Cash Bonus Or Similar.   Only Reason Why Our Stay 'Met' Expectations Was Because We Know Bovey Is Always Great!,,,,,
,3711,Service Charges Were Excessive. I Opted It Pay Some But Not All As Had Left Tips In Cash,,,,,
,3712,We Had A Great Time With You And Bovey Castle Has Style In Every Respect. However  While The Service Was Excellent  Charging The Discretionary Service Charge Is A Little Presumptuous And Tainted Things As We Left. It Would Have Been A Big Deal Not Paying It So Discretionary Is Not An Accurate Description. I Believe You Could Add The 5% On To The Overall Room Cost And Lose No Custom. A Sign On Reception Saying: 'Please Don't Tip For Service  Our Hospitality Is Free' Would Have A Lot Of Style. You Would Make The Same Money  Avoid That Awkward Bill Moment On Checkout And Tips May Still Be Left.  Just A Thought. As I Said  We Really Did Have A Brilliant Time  Thank You.,,,,,
,3713,Nice Enough But There Are Probably Many Similar Establishments With Better Standard  Better Attention To Detail And Better Execution. Felt It Lack That Little Extra Which You Would Expect At This Price Range And Which Is What Makes Us More Likely To Try Somewhere Else Next Time Rather Than Return. 5-Star Yes  But A Weak 5-Star In Our Books.,,,,,
,3716,Replace Ripped Staff Uniform.  Do Not Put Guests In Rooms Only Fit For Wedding Guests.  Improve Service All Round  Maybe Some Staff Training?,,,,,
,3724,Not Treat Us Asa Second Class Citizens Just Because We Didnt Turn Up In An Expensive Car.  If U Are Going To Sell Rooms Through Promotional Sites  I Would Suggest Some Staff Are Retrained To Be Aware Of Discriminations That They May Have When Dealing With Paying Customers,,,,,
,3726,Yes  Make Us Feel A Bit More Welcome Rather Than Slightly 2Nd Class Citizens Due To Being On A Travelzoo Deal (One Of The Staff In The Evening Of Our Stay Was Surprised We 'Hadn't Been Given The Tour Of The Castle/Hotel)'  Which We Were Never Offered  And The Reception Staff Were A Bit Supercilious When We Asked Questions About Activities).  Activities Were The Major Disappointment - We Had Booked Primarily On The Basis Of A Newspaper Article About The Extensive Activities On Offer But Were Unable To Do That Much.  (Badminton Wasn't Set Up  Table Tennis Wasn't Set Up  You Couldn't Play Golf Unless You Were A Good Golfer  The Falconry Display Was V Brief  Being Inside With Only Archimedes The Owl (I Appreciate This Was Partly A Weather Issue Beyond The Hotel's Control).  The Only Things We Could Do Were Golf Putting  Swimming/Gym And Waterlogged Croquet Where We Got Wet Feet!,,,,,
,3728,One Of The Things That Appealled When I Looked At The Hotels Website Was That You Offered Additional Activities. We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Bird Of Prey Display In The Morning But Had Also Hoped To Borrow Mountain Bikes To Go For A Cycle On The Moors. I Was Therefore Very Disappointed To Discover That None Were Available As They Were All Away Being Serviced. I Know Bikes Do Need Servicing And I Appreciate That Post The Busy Summer Season  The Autumn Is Perhaps A Good Time To Get It Done  However I Think The Servicing Should Be Staggered To Ensure That At Least Some Bikes Are Available No Matter What The Season.,,,,,
,3730,Great Venue  Stunning Location  Stunning Building But Just A Little More Attention To Detail In All Areas Outlined Above Would Move It From Average To Very Good.,,,,,
,3731,Afternoon Tea Was Very Busy With Non Residents Which Left No Lounge Space For Us To Relax.,,,,,
,3732,Free Wifi,,,,,
,3740,I'd Definitely Increase The Capacity Of Your Spa. With Such A High Quality Spa I'm Sure That You'd Not Be Short Of Demand.  Also  I'd Make More Food Choices At Your Bistro. The Variety Of Meals Offered Was Very Small In My Opinion For Such A Luxury Restaurant. Also  The Soup Of The Day Remained The Same Throughout Our Stay. One Thing That Would Likely Be Useful For Many Of Your Clients Would Be Installing A Cell Phone Transmitter (Or Signal Enhancer) Within Your Estate To Increase The Signal Both Inside Bovey Castle As Well As Outside.,,,,,
,3741,See Above Comments,,,,,
,3743,The Bill Would Be Easier To Check If It Was Fully Itemised,,,,,
,3758,Bar Prices Seemed Rather High- £12.50 For A Glass Of House Wine Is Somewhat Extortionate!,,,,,
,3764,Please Can You Amend The Presentation Of Your Final Bill.  Normally In Other Establishments You Expect To See What You Ordered On One Occasion I.E. Dinner And Not Have Separate Food Charge  Drinks Charge And Service Charge.  It Would Be Clearer If The Food & Drink Were Combined And If The Service Charge Has To Be Applied  Put In The Total At The End.  In Addition  This Was The First Time We Were Charged For Internet Access Which On Previous Visits Had Been Free.  In Light Of The Fact That Mobile Reception Is Limited  Surely If A Charge Has To Be Made  The Internet Cost Could Be Absorbed Into The Room Rate.,,,,,
,3770,No Further Comments.,,,,,
,3775,Buffet Breakfast Was Disapointing.  This Had Previously Been The Highlight Of Our Stay However The Buffet Was Not Replenished Often Enough Resulting In Items Not Being Available.  We Had To Ask Twice For Our Tea And Coffee Order. The Edwardian Grill Menu Was The Same For Two Consecutive Nights Resulting In Us Dining Off The Premises.  Should This Have Been Different We May Of Used The Restaurant For The Second Night Also.,,,,,
,3778,Discretionary Service Charge?' It Was Added To The Bill And Was Really Rather Annoying And There Was No Means To Take It Off But It's A Hotel So I Don't Understand Why It Was Added.,,,,,
,3787,I Stay In A Lot Of Nice Hotels With Work And Also For Leisure And Whilst At Times The Service Was Great  A Few Members Of Staff Really Let The Side Down And Left A Bad Taste In My Mouth. When You Are Paying That Sort Of Money  You Deserve To Be Treated Better. A Real Pity As Its A Beautiful Hotel.,,,,,
,3788,No,,,,,
,3794,Acknowledged Concerns Regarding The Room Being Too Hot.,,,,,
,3803,When We Arrived We Were Looked After And Given A Tour Of The Hotel  This Made Us Feel At Home And Instantly Welcome. We Were Also Made Aware Of The Falconry Display Taking Place The Following Morning Which We Could See From Our Bedroom Window.,,,,,
,3810,Earlier Check In Or Clearer Communication  More Extensive Information About The Building And Surroundings At The Introduction Tour Of The Hotel,,,,,
,3811,Not Include Extra Charges  On Top Of How Much We Paid For Just A Basic Room  E.G. Paying Nearly £15 Per Head For Breakfast Was  We Felt  Unnecessary.,,,,,
,3814,A Map Of The Facilities Showing The Pool And Restaurants.,,,,,
,3821,No And I Would Have Paid The Discretionary Service Charge If I Could Have Afforded To Do So.,,,,,
,3826,Make Sure All Staff Actually Want To Be There.,,,,,
,3828,Our Room - Number 62 - Was Directly Opposite The Kitchen Vents Which Made A Racket... On A Sunday Morning  That's Really Not Ideal And Detracts From The Stay,,,,,
,3831,It Would Be Really Helpful To Have Better Information And Maps Available To Guests For Local Leisure Activities Apart From Golf.,,,,,
,3833,Price Very Expensive For What You Got. £465.00 For A Double Room Dbb To Me Is A Lot. Organised Dinner But Chicken Wings  Burger & A Hard Waffle Not Worth The Money. I Also Felt Breakfast For A 5 Star Was Very Poor. Not Much Offerings  Flies On Bacon Etc.,,,,,
,3845,The Food Was Very Average.,,,,,
,3850,Fireworks Were Excellent But Other Than That The Rest Of New Year Was Poor,,,,,
,3851,I Did Find The Bill Difficult To Follow. For Example Afternoon Champagne Tea Is £25 But On The Bill The Champagne Is Charged From The Bar And Food From The Restaurant. Still Not Sure The Total Was Right But Was Happy To Trust You.,,,,,
,3852,The Reception Staff Must Make It Clear That The Service Charge Was Discretionary. This Was Not Done On Check Out. I Would Not Have Paid This Simply Because Of The State Of The Greens On The Golf Course.,,,,,
,3858,Make It Feel Like Home  Know Our Names (We Stayed 4 Nights So No Excuse!) Be Around When We Need You - Alweays Hunting For Staff.  Recption To Cease Talking When Guest Arrives.  Just Requires More Energy And Personal Attention,,,,,
,3860,There Should Be More Table Settings Outside During The Summer Months For Afternoon Tea. We Could Not Sit Outside Because There Was Not Enough Tables Available  Yet There Was Plenty Of Space Outside.,,,,,
,3862,Tennis Equipment Is In Terrible Condition  Not Enough Left Handed Clubs  Air Rifles Did Not Work The Day We Had Activity Set Up  Bistro Service Was Slow And Inconsistent.,,,,,
,3871,There Was A Banging Noise All Night Outside Of The Room (Like A Window Shutter Blowing In The Wind And Hitting The Wall  Or A Door Blowing And Banging) But Don't Know What It Was. Mentioned It At Reception When Checking Out But They Didn't Seem To Want To Know. It Was What Woke Me Up In The Morning To Get Up  As The Alarm Call We Had Requested Came 15 Mins Late.,,,,,
,3872,I Did Not Settle The Account So No Idea. Better Half Did.   Overall The Dining Part Could Have Gone Better (Breakfast Excellent By The Way!) Surroundings And Walks In The Area Are Great. Flying Birds Is A Nice Thing To Go See After Breakfast.   Good Stay All In All And Would Recommend To Others  But Warn About The Dinner. For Me Bistro And Pub In Village Were A Lot Better. Or Maybe It Was Just Bad Luck On My Part This Time Around  Although Pricing Would Perhaps Remain An Issue,,,,,
,3874,Ask What Pillows We Require - Firm Soft Etc. Provide Air Coolers As Could Not Have Window Open In Night As Too Noisy As I Was Over The Reception Area And Cars Were Leaving Etc. At All Hours.,,,,,
,3877,We All Agreed That The Hotel And Its Facilities For The Most Part Are Excellent.  Our Children Were Constantly Entertained  Despite The Lack Of A Decent Kids Club (Please Refer To Calcot Manor  Cotswolds Kids Club) And Activities Quality Was Ebyond What We Have Found At Other Hotels. However The Delivery Of Such Activities And Services Were Poor.  It Seems That There Has Been A Major Management Revamp At Bovey Whereby Staff Have No Idea What Job They Are Doing And When.  Staff In The Restaurant Need To Be Far More Professional And Staff Elsewhere Need To Know Answers To Questions From Guests.,,,,,
,3878,Our Anniversary Was Not Acknowledged At All Despite My Husband Having Rung Specifically To Advise In Advance.,,,,,
,3880,You Could Dust Your Oak Room  Particularly In The Light Shades  Which Are Filthy. You Could Remove The Automatic Service Charge  Your Staff Need Significant Training  The Food Needs A Lot Of Improvement And You Need To Pay More Attention To Maintenance. You Should Also Reduce Your Prices Drastically  They Are Far Too High For What You Offer And This Leaves Your Guests Feeling Ripped Off.,,,,,
,3881,Chocolates On The Pillow At Turn Down  Maybe?,,,,,
,3883,No,,,,,
,3889,Our Stay Was Lovely  We Were Married The Week Before And Did A Mini-Uk Honeymoon At Two 5 Star Hotels. You Made Us Feel At Home.,,,,,
,3892,The Lack Of Clarity Over The Bill Has Left Something Of A Sour Taste. I Am More Than Happy To Pay Room Rates  Charges For Our Pooch And Alcohol But Bearing In Mind We Were On A Package That Was Inclusive Of One Dinner And Tea To Then Add Service Charges Seems Unfair Particularly When It Is Presented As A Fair Accompli At The End Of Your Visit. It Feels Like A Cash Extraction Process And Not A Transparent One  When No Indication Of This Was Provided As Part Of The Package.,,,,,
,3895,I Don't Agree With Your Tip Policy.  Although I Realise It Wasn't Compulsory When It Is Automatically Added To A Bill And The Person Who Will Ultimately Receive The Bill Asks If It Is Ok To Keep It On The Bill It Is Very Awkward To Say No.  I Am Very Happy To Tip For Exceptional Service  But I Don't Feel Comfortable Tipping For What In Most Cases Was Just Ok/Reasonable Service.  You Need To Review Your Tipping Policy Because I Expect I Am Not The Only Visitor Who Feels This Way.  However I Do Agree That All Tips Made  Should Go To The Staff - For Ensuring That Bovey Castle Should Be Congratulated.,,,,,
,3898,Bathrooms Could Be Of Higher Spec,,,,,
,3899,I Feel It Was A Strange Touch To Add A Service Charge To All Beauty Treatments And Room Charge And Each Night Stayed. Felt This Was Really Un-Necessary And Slightly Embarrasing.,,,,,
,3900,More Wellies!  None Left In My Size So I Had A Very Muddy Walk In My Trainers.   Heating In The Main Areas Of The Hotel A Little Too Much For Me.,,,,,
,3901,Up Until The Point Of Check Out We Would Have Said The Experience Met Or Even Exceeded Our Expectations And We Felt Very Sad To Leave On A Negative Point As We Had Been Thinking Of When We Might Return And Perhaps For A Longer Period Of Time.  Although We Wouldn't Discount Returning We Shall Certainly Consider Our Options.,,,,,
,3903,On Leaving  We Asked For Our Luggage To Be Brought Downstairs. Whilst Waiting In The Cold Outside By The Car We Decided To Go Back Indoors And Wait There Only To Discover The Luggage Was In The Reception Foyer. No One Helped Us With The Luggage To The Car Even Though There Were Staff Around. Also  Serving A Pot Of Tea Could Be Improved By Providing A Pot Of Hot Water To Add To The Tea As The Tea Became Too Strong To Drink After The First Cup Was Poured.,,,,,
,3905,Carpet N My Room Was Baldly Stained  Cobwebs On The Ceiling Of My Bathroom  Bistro Staff Were Terrible  Golf Staff Were Not That Friendly.  All Fine For A Hotel That Charges Lessbut At Your Price I Expected Better,,,,,
,3907,Bring Back The Magic In The Staff. They Seem To Have Lost The Edge When Compared With My Previous Two Visits. I Do Not Expect To See A Chef And Doorman Playing 'Imaginary Cricket' In The Main Reception Doorway And I Do Not Expect To Be Left Waiting For1.5 Hours For A Dinner Reservation.,,,,,
,3908,To Have Eaten In The Bistro All Three Nights.,,,,,
,3910,I Will Write Separately,,,,,
,3915,I Would Not Charge A Service Charge On Everything!,,,,,
,3916,See Comment Re Swim-Wear,,,,,
,3917,To Be Honest. Probably Wouldn't Have Paid The Service Charge - But This Wasn't Brought To My Attention After The Spa Treatments When I Needed To Sign The Bill. So I Didn't Notice.  Reception On Leaving Seemed Stressed Even Though There Were 2 Couples Checking Out And 2 Girls Working At Reception. I Felt Stressed Just By Being Near Them.  A Third Couple Asked To View A Lodge And Were Told There Would Be A Very Long Wait As They Were Busy Checking People Out. ( This Was About Noon. We Were Late Checking Out Due To Delays At Breakfast). Just Not The Right Response.  The Best Room In The Castle (Cathedral Room) You Couldn't Relax In As It Was So Smokey! So You Couldn't Even Sit There. Really Disappointing!  I Think It Was The Hotel Manager Who Was Very Attentive And Focused On Service But Other Staff Were Just Not Up To Standard.,,,,,
,3918,Very Disappoint By The Fact That All Guests On 'Special' Rates Were Put In The Same Side Room For Breakfast.  I Have Never Experienced This And Would Have Thought That You Would Have Liked To Add To The Atmosphere In The Edwardian Dining Room.  Makes The Guests Feel Like Second Class Citizens.  It Is Because Of This That Our Experience Fell Below Our Expectations.  It Just Makes Your Guests Disinclined To Want To Come Again.  It Isn't Very Welcoming And/Or Generous Of Spirit.,,,,,
,3919,Ensure Accuracy Of Final Bill,,,,,
,3923,No Placed Us In A Room On That Side Of The Castle.,,,,,
,3924,No. All Staff Tried Really Hard But I Think On The Friday You Had Too Many Guests/Functions And Not Enough Staff.,,,,,
,3927,Maybe A Welcome Pack For The Children? It Could Contain A Childrens Map Of The Hotel  A Small Pack Of Crayons And Drawing Paper  Tokens To Be Redeemed For A Treat At The Bistro( Ice Cream  Cupcake  Muffin  Etc)  A Little Gift  Diary Of Events For The Week  Leaflets Of Available Extra Activitys.  Drawing Paper For The Kids At The Bistro Would Be Good To Occupy The Little Guests So The Adults Could Relax And Dine A Little Longer.,,,,,
,3928,The Final Bill Is Incorrect Every Time We Have Stayed,,,,,
,3930,The Discretionary Service Charge Was Automatically Added To Every Bill.  As A Suggestion Please Allow Guests To Freely Add Accordingly.,,,,,
,3933,Having Take-Away Cups For Coffee Would Have Been Nice For Our Outings On Cold Days.,,,,,
,3934,The Bill Was Confusing- We Both Disliked Having 12% Automatically Added To The Bill- Quite Frankly Cheeky. Yes We Know We Can Take It Off If We Wanted- But Why Put It On In The First Place. Answer- Squeeze More Money Out The Clients. Not Very Dignified For Such A Dignified Place. I Would Like To Give A Tip To Whom I Choose  Not Just Everyone.,,,,,
,3935,Heat The Bedroom  Put Champagne In The Room When Asked For And Don't Try Charging It When You Haven't. Don't Focus On Corporate Evenings And Forget Your Other Customers. Redecorate Rooms That Clearly Need It. Extend The Mini Bar To Include Decent Treats And Beverages. Generally Raise The Personal Touch And Service  Because Having Stayed At Gidleigh Park The Same Weekend - You Are Miles Behind Them.,,,,,
,3936,You Need To Sort Out The Kitchen/Dining. It Would Also Help If The Serving Staff New What Was On The Menu And Offer Assistance As Opposed To'i Don't Know As I Haven't Tried Anything On The Menu',,,,,
,3937,A Tour Of The  Facilities As Offered To Other Guests,,,,,
,3940,Some Form Of Supervision In The Pool During Busy Times Would Be Worth While. There Was Some Very Dangerous Behaviour From Some Guests... Adult.... That Could Have Led To An Injury.,,,,,
,3951,Improved The Weather ;),,,,,
,3953,Attention To Detail Is Key.,,,,,
,3955,Just That We Were Made Aware Of What We Had Got For Our Package  Ie Meals And Size Of Bed Also That When We Got Our Bill It Wasnt Itemised Regarding The Tips As We Were Informed As It Was A Discretionary 5% But That Was Put On It Nothing Stating Discretionary Just A Final Bill Which I Thought A Little Naughty,,,,,
,3956,When I Booked The Package We Were Made Aware Of The Disretionary 5% Service Charge  When We Asked For The Bill There Was A Final Amout No Option Was Made But To Pay It  It Wasn't Clearly Itemised. I Dont Mind Paying For Good Service But Thought The Lack Of Communication We Experianced Didn't Deserve The £70.00 Tip We Paid Not Knowing How Not To Pay It!!!!!!!,,,,,
,3958,See Comments Below (As Mentioned Earlier),,,,,
,3960,Changed Our Room But You Were Full?!,,,,,
,3962,No,,,,,
,3964,This Hotel Is Not 5 Star  And The Fine Dining Is Not Fine Dining.  The Rooms Needto Be All Updated And Maint. Needs To Be Kept Up To Date.  Also The Hidden Charges Of 5% Charge On The Bill Was Not A Nice Surprise And One That Should Be Made Clear In The T&C And When Booking.  Overall We Will Not Be Coming Back Anytime Soon.,,,,,
,3965,I Expected More Of A 5 * Rated Hotel.  The Bedroom Is In Need Of Some Tlc And Looked Tired.  Not Sure Why There Is A 5% Service Charge On The Accommodation.  Should Ask Customers First If A 15% Service Charge Is Appropriate Prior To Adding To The Bill.House Keeping Did Not Respond To Requests - Had To Chase Twice For Milk To Replenished As Not Done When Room Made Up.,,,,,
,3967,Free High Speed Internet And Better Healthier Food.,,,,,
,3970,The Breakfast Needed Better Service And Food. A Larger Buffet.,,,,,
,3971,No.,,,,,
,3974,Nicer Room.  Better Food.  Better Value For Money.,,,,,
,3976,Upon Leaving  No One Offered To Carry Our Bags To The Car.  Our Experience Of Bovey Castle Was Outstanding When We We Visted Last Year  Hence Our Return. However  This Year We Felt Disappointed From The Moment We Arrived.,,,,,
,3983,On Reflection We Were Very Disappointed With Our Stay.  We Felt That Everything Was Over-Priced And The Room Certainly Did Not Live Up To The Expectations We Had Of This Prestigious Hotel.,,,,,
,3984,We Drink Decaffeinated Tea Which Wasn't In The Room. When We Asked At Reception We Were Told That They Would See If Any Could Be Found. After 25 Minutes We Phoned Down As We'd Heard Nothing And Were Told That They Were Still Waiting To Hear From Housekeeping. In The End We Ordered A Pot Of Decaf Tea From Room Service Which We Were Then Charged For.,,,,,
,3985,A Couple Of Small Issues With The Food  Black Toast At Breakfast And My Partners Beef Burger Was Very Dry From Our Evening Meal.,,,,,
,3986,Generally The Hotel Was Great  But Certain Things Detracted From The Quality And Overall Experience. E.G. Inexperienced Waiting Staff  Lack Of Facilities In Changing Room At Pool  And I Was Astonished To Pay Over £7 For 2 Coffees In The Lounge - This Smacked Of Money Making And Putting That Above The Client Experience. I Think Tea/Coffee In The Lounge Should Be Free Ie Included In The Overall Rate Paid To Stay In The Hotel.,,,,,
,3987,See Comments About The Bedroom.,,,,,
,3989,I Know It Is Winter  But The Hotel Was A Little On The Cold Side  As Ws The Swimming Pool.,,,,,
,3990,Upgrade Lodge Furnishings And Spa/Pool Area.,,,,,
,3991,Improve Service  Think About Children More In The Dining Experience,,,,,
,3992,The Rooms Really Should Be Renovate (Windows Bathroom Carpets) And Staff (Breakfast/Dinner) We Expected More Service.,,,,,
,3994,No.,,,,,
,3995,Just When We Were Checking In It Would Have Been Great To Have Been Told All About What Was Available To Our Son In Terms Of Facilities Etc Rather Than Having To Find Them Out Ourselves,,,,,
,3997,Please Wallpaper That Bathroom!,,,,,
,3998,I Have Ticked Fell Below As There Is No Option For Fell Well Below Which I Would Have Ticked I Also Said Yes I Paid The 'Discretionary' Service Charge As At No Point Was The 'Discretionary' Element Explained To Me,,,,,
,3999,No  We Were Very Happy With Our Stay And Hope To Return One Day.,,,,,
,4000,It Would Have Been Nice To Have Made Our 16Th Wedding Anniversary A Special Occasion But This Seemed To Be Missed.  We Felt That While We Had Chosen Bovey Castle Especially For A Rare Child-Free Night Away The Staff Saw Us As Another Fee Paying Guest Rather Than A Personal Treat Saved Up For And Looked Forward To.,,,,,
,4001,We Found The Offer Of A Turn Down Service When You Are Showering And Changing Before Dinner Rather Pointless. Our Favourite Hotel  Lewtrenchard Manor Carry This Out When Guests Are At Dinner Which Is A Lovely Touch.,,,,,
,4003,The Evening Meal Did Take A Long Time. We Sat Down At 8:30Pm But Did Not Get Our First Course (Main Course) Until 9:25Pm. We Only Finished Our Meal At 10:45Pm. As Pleasant As It All Was Having A Chat With The Waiter And Taking In The Atmosphere  It Would Have Been Nicer If We'd Had Some Evening To Ourselves Following The Meal. As It Was We Ended Up Going Straight To Bed.,,,,,
,4004,While The Welcome At Bogey Castle Was Perfect The Checking-Out Was Not So Great  Unfortunately. We Needed Help With Our Suitcases And Someone From The Reception Told Us That Someone Would Help Us To Carry Our Luggage To Our Car Twice Nobody Came In The End. This Is A Minor Flaw But Together With An Uncomprehensible Bill It Left Us Leaving Bovey Castle With A Hint Of Disappointment. We Had Booked A Package B&B&Dine Fpr 350 British Pounds But Somehow Had To Pay 440 British Pounds; The B&B&Dine Offer You Made On Your Homepage Apparently Did Not Include All Meals On Your Menu So We Had To Pay Extra For That. I Would Have Appreciated That Someone Had Told Or Informed Us Before Because Your 350-Offer Dos Not State Any Exclusions. At The End Of A Stay This Is Something You Will Not Forget And Which Will Affect To Overall Rating  Unfortunately.,,,,,
,4005,There Were 200Gbp Of Over Charges On My Bill. This On A One Night Stay! This Spoilt An Otherwise Great Stay. You Tried To Charge Me Twice For Internet. You Did Not Take Off The 90Gbp Towards The Dinner. You Did Not Provide The Champagne I Preordered When I Booked But You Did Charge Me For It You Charged Me For The Children's Breakfast But It Was Included In My Rate. No Milk Was Available In Room For The Tea And Coffee Facilities And So I Rang Room Service To Provide It . You Charged Me 5Gbp For A Tiny Cup Of Milk Which I Think You Should Provide Free Of Charge.,,,,,
,4009,Didn't Like Beeky In The Cage!,,,,,
,4010,It Wasn't As Good As My First Visit,,,,,
,4011,Lockers In The Leisure Facilities Would Be Helpful.,,,,,
,4014,We Have High Expectations From Previous Trips.... Unfortunately It Fell Short This Time. Still Very Good  Though We Will Look At Other Luxury Hotels For Future Short Breaks.,,,,,
,4015,Got The Wifi Sorted - Though You Did Offer Us Another Lodge Which Was Kind,,,,,
,4016,More Explicit Pricing. Cleaners Not Hovering Around The Lodge 30+ Minutes Before Departure Time.,,,,,
,4018,Perhaps Could Make Service In Lounge/Bar Areas Slicker - Just Felt Under Staffed At Times,,,,,
,4019,I Don't Think It Could Have Been Any Better  It Was Amazing.,,,,,
,4021,Please Could You Improve The Outdoor Play Facilities.  The Swings Were Broken And It Would Be Reassuring If You Could Put A Wooden Bar Up Along The Walk Way On The Slide (Although With Each Year As My Children Get Older This Worries Me A Little Less).  I Spoke To Many Parents Who Felt That A Little More Outdoor Play Equipment Would Improve The Experience For The Children.,,,,,
,4024,Not Really!,,,,,
,4026,See Previous Comments. Also  While The Front Desk Staff Were Friendly And Pleasant  We Had No Fewer Than Six Charges -- Not One Below £150 -- On Our Final Bill That Turned Out To Be Erroneous. They Removed Them But This Was Quite Surprising And Somewhat Of An Inconvenience.,,,,,
,4027,Better Room Service,,,,,
,4028,A Better Map For Cycle Routes  But Im Only Being Picky.,,,,,
,4037,More Variety Of Cooked Food At Breakfast. Bread Served With The Soup At Lunch Time Rather Than A Rather Limited Array Of Sandwiches. Bread Came Out Later  But It Was Too Late. The Soup Was Excellent Though.,,,,,
,4042,No  Absolutely Nothing...,,,,,
,4045,There Was A Double Billing Of A Rental Movie And An Extra Bed Charge For My Daughter In A Superior Double Where We Were The Only Two Staying.  Both Were Corrected Easily But I Am Glad I Looked At The Bill.,,,,,
,4046,Sent An Email To Frederico Aresti To Explain How Disappointed We Were,,,,,
,4051,The Red Book Of Walks From Reception Has The Most Useless 'Not To Scale' Hand Drawn Maps. I'm Sure Many Guests Have Had Experienced An Unexpected Extension To Their Walks Due To The Inaccuracy Of These Maps. The Most Useful Role For This Book Is Helping To Light The Fire At The Ring Of Bells.,,,,,
,4052,I Think The Dining Experience Was Not Up To The Standards Of Service Or Food For The Prices Charged.  It Would Put Me Off Dining Again.  Also At Breakfast We Were Not Informed That We Had To Help Ourselves So Were Therefore Left Waiting  Until We Asked Ourselves !!,,,,,
,4053,We Had Our Car Returned To Us With A Smashed Tail Light  I Have Originally Mentioned It By Phone Call And Have Followed Up With 2 Emails  First Email I Was Told It Was Being Passed To Someone To Deal With  Second Email Has Not Been Acknowledged... Disappointed That Noone Has Had The Courtesy To Follow Up.,,,,,
,4054,Improve The Tv Situation In The Castle Rooms  You Should Have Hd Tv's And Dvd Players In All Rooms Plus You Require A Mobile Mast On The Grounds Somewhere As Constantly No Signal Which Is Bad. In The Library Room The Board Games Were Incomplete (Pieces Missing) Which Should Be Checked More Often Its Nice To Play With The Children If Its A Rainy Day Outside.,,,,,
,4056,Train The Staff. There Seemed To Be A Lot Of Them  All Standing Around Doing Nothing. Poor Communication Between Staff Members,,,,,
,4057,1.  More Staff - Service Was Slow On Occasion And The Staff Generally Looked Rather Too Busy! (Although All Of Them Did A Brilliant Job).   2.  Small  But Noticeable (In A Luxury Environment) Maintenance That Would Be Lovely To Fix - Eg Ceiling Plaster Blown Above A Staircase Needed Repair  The Bottom Of Our Bathroom Door Was Chipped And Could Have Done With A Re-Paint.,,,,,
,4059,Accomadation Could Have Been Better,,,,,
,4062,There Was Just A Tiny Bit Of Confusion As Regards Booking Afternoon Tea.  We Were Told That We Couldn't Reserve A Table For Our Preferred Time But Were Offerd A Much Later Slot.  When Our Preferred Time Came  We Were Easily Accomodated In The Bar And The Staff We Spoke To There Couldn't Understand Why We Had Been Told To Wait Until 4Pm.  Maybe This Is An Attempt By The Front Desk To Stagger The Workload For The Waiting Staff  But They Really Seemed To Be Coping.  It Is Only A Minor Thing In An Otherwise Faultless Stay.,,,,,
,4063,We Had Dinner At The Edwardian On 8/04/12. The Initial Service Was Prompt But Then Went Slow  The Dessert Menu Came After 20-25 Minutes And The Dessert A Further 15-20 Minutes Later. I Would Have Understood Had You Been Too Busy At That Time But It Was Not. The Fact That It Took The Service So Long To Provide With The Dessert Menu And That Too After Calling Them Shows Lack Of Attentiveness . I Had Been To Many Restaurants   Most Of Them Not Rated But Provided Better Service That Yours. The Fact That I Ended Up On A Wobbly Chair And That Too In A 5 Star Graded Hotel Doesn't Seem Good. How Would You Have Missed That A Chair Is Not Stable. Why Didn't You Checked It Before?,,,,,
,4067,Food And Restaurants Need To Be Better And Nicer.....Match The Beauty And. Coziness Of The Other Rooms And The Castle.....,,,,,
,4068,The Activities Were Very Expensive For What They Were. I Don't Mind Paying For Them On Holidays  But The Shooting Was A Blatant Rip Off. 75 Quid And I Only Pulled The Trigger About 25 Times. The Instruction Was Good But The Value Really Wasnt There.,,,,,
,4080,We Came To Bovey Castle Not Knowing What To Expect  But We Found The Hotel And Grounds All To Be Very Pleasant. We Had Worried That We Wouldn't Feel Comfortable But Those Fears Soon Left When We Wandered Around And Were Greeted By The Staff Everytime We Pass Any. The Whole Feel Is One Of Quality Without Being Stuffy,,,,,
,4081,Better Customer Service At Arrival And Departure Of Spa - Felt Rushed As We Had Signed To Leave. Bistro Staff Were Unfriendly Also. As We Left The Door Boy Was Busy Chatting To Reception And We Had To Struggled To Open The Door With Bags And Then He Turned Around And Half Heartedly Moved Towards The Door As We Were Through It.,,,,,
,4085,It Was A Shame That We Did Not Have A Great Visit. I Think We Had Stayed At A Hotel 3 Days Before And Had A Great Experience  It Was A Lesser Starred Hotel But We Were Made To Feel Really Special And Had A Fantastic Time  One Of The Waitresses Had Said She Had Worked At Your Hotel Before And Really Sang Its Praises And Said We Wouldbe Really Well Looked After And So Iguess We Expected An Even Better Experience And We Did Not Get It  In Fact We Felt Competely The Opposite. It Was Our First Wedding Anniversary On The Monday And I Thought We Were Going To Just Have Meal At The First Hotel And Then This Offer Came Up So I Said We Should Come And Have The Stay For Our Anniversary  But Unknown To Me My Husband Had Actually Booked The Hotel For The Night So We Ended Up With 2 Nights Away  So Although We Had Our Anniversary Celebration On The Monday This Stay Was Also For Our Anniversary And So This Did Spoil It A Little.,,,,,
,4086,Reception Staff And Bovey Team Need More Training. One Hand Doesn't Know What The Other Is Doing.  Asked 3 Times In One Sitting For Our Breakfast Order. We Were Asked If We Wanted Buffet Breakfast On 1 Occasionthen On The Other Occasion We Were Told We Could Either Have English Buffet Or Continental Buffet But Not Choose From Both?  Come On ..You Are Supposed To Be 5Star!,,,,,
,4087,I Would Describe It As A Champagne Price For A Larger Top Service.  The Delivery Was Not Quite Up To Your Own Image Of The Hotel.  Hopeless Internet And Phone Connections.  Couldnt Get Through To Room Service.  Food Turned Up Cold.  Hp Suace Turned Up 20Mins After The Food Had Been Eaten.  Had To Ask For Coffee Three Times Over Breakfast.  Over Promised And Under Delivered.,,,,,
,4089,Improve Service Regarding Food/Beverages Served In Library As Well As Bistro Food Not Good  Staff Inefficient   On The Contrary  Food In Edwardian Grill Was Very Good But Service Was Still Not Efficient. Waiter Dropped The Bread On The Floor...And Even The Wine Bottle !,,,,,
,4090,Decorated The Rooms Yearly   Put Fans In Them  Stop Clients Paying For Wifi,,,,,
,4091,More Mobile Phone Hotspots  Had To Keep Walking To Bistro To Pick Up Messages. Do Not Think 12% Service Should Be Added To Orders In Bistro For Less Than £10.  I Ordered Capaccinno Each Morning Wand Was Charged Service... At Bistro You Should Provide Papers  Normally Had To Go And Fin One From Another Area At Bistro You Should Have Semi Or Skimmed Mil As Well As Full Fat Milk ,,,,,
,4092,Bovey Castle Needs Better Food,,,,,
,4094,The Location And Accommodation Were Excellent  But The Service Fell Way Below What I Would Have Expected For Such An Expensive Hotel. Staff Were Not Well Trained And Frequently Forgot Or Got Wrong Requests We Made.  ,,,,,
,4096,My Stay At Bovey Was Very Pleasent As I Would Have Expected From A Hotel Of This Standing  The Only Point That I Would Raise Is That There Was Confusion On Our Activity Of Clay Shooting And The Staff Left Without Us And We Waited For A Long While This Was Sorted And Arrived Late For Our Activity  Which Was Not A Problem  But Generally I Felt As Did Another Guest That The Communication Between Activities Staff And The Hotel Was Perhaps Sub Standard Against The Level Of Service The Hotel Itself Offers. I Hope You Find This Constructive And Not As A Moan.,,,,,
,4098,We Were Staying As A 'Honeymoon' Evening - The Staff Who Greeted Us Congratulated Us On Our Marriage Which Was Noce. My Husband Had Emailed Beforehand To Let You Know It Was Our Honeymoon Night Away And The Reply Was That The Ooking Has Been Amended And Noted Accordingly. There Was Nothing Done To Acknowledge The Marriage Other Than The Congratulations Which I Think My Hisband Was Lead To Beloeve There Might Be. A Bit Disappointing.,,,,,
,4099,Fresh Marmelade/Jam For Breakfast (No Glasses),,,,,
,4101,I Tried To Book A Treatment At The Spa  But It Was Full During Our Stay.  It Would Be Worth Saying Something On Your Website About Making Sure You Book In Advance So That Guests Are Otc Disappointed.,,,,,
,4102,Withdraw The 12.5% Service Charge - This Will Be Paid If The Service Is Good...  Add The Little Extras - Well - Put Them Back In... 5-Star Hotel... No Canopies With A £8 Cocktail?! Just Peanuts... Come On...,,,,,
,4108,Very Much,,,,,
,4109,As You Can See From My Previous Comments Our Visit Was Far From Perfect. In Addition To The Points Already Raised When We Arrived We Tried To Book Our Spa Treatments  However Reception Staff Stated That They Couldn't Help And That We Needed To Speak To The Hotel Leisure Team Located Near To Reception. We Couldn't Find Anyone From The Hotel Leisure Team So Asked At Reception A Further 3 Times About Booking Spa Treatments. Reception Stated That Someone Would Call Us At 08.30 On The Wednesday Morning  We Received No Call So Went To Reception Again After Breakfast And Was Introduced To Member Of The Leisure Team. We Were Then Advised That There Was No Spa Treatments Available Other Than A 25 Minute Express Treatment Due To A Corporate Booking.,,,,,
,4110,We Did Feel It Was Generally Overpriced   Especially When I Found Some Deals On Our Return That Were Much Cheaper. The Discretionalry Charge Was Heavily Implied Rather Than An Option To Pay.,,,,,
,4111,Everything Was Great. Bovey Castle Is A Beautiful Destination  We Were Really Pleased That We Visited. My Friend & I Discussed Re-Visiting With Our Partners. The Only Negative Comments I Can Offer Is The Check In/Out Times Were Meaner Than Most. 3Pm Check In & 11Am Check Out On A 1 Night Stay Is Very Tight.,,,,,
,4113,I Had To Specifically Ask The Person At The Desk To Explain My Final Account. The Whole Time I Was There - There Was An Attitude Of 'Dont Ask The Price - Just Pay'. Champagne Was Pushed On Us In The Bar Before Dinner (Before We Could Look At The Price List) And I Was Only Given A Nano-Second To Look At The Restaurant Bill To Make Sure It Was Correct. The Same Happened On Departure.,,,,,
,4114,I Personally Would Have Like A Detailed Bill Of What We Had Spent In The Restaurant Etc,,,,,
,4115,No. I Felt Like All My Expectations Were Exceeded And The Overall Experience Was Fantastic. I Will Definately Be Returning..,,,,,
,4121,If You Had A Magic Wand And Changed The Constant Rain That Would Help! :-),,,,,
,4126,Better Food And Renovated Room And A Better Cellphone Connection And A Stabile Internet.,,,,,
,4128,There Was No Milk In The Room For Tea Or Coffee. Tried Calling Reception But Nobody Answered Hence Had To Drink Black Coffee.,,,,,
,4129,Departure Early Sunday Morning Was Very Complicated As Reception Could Not Get Us Transportation From The Lodge. As A Result  We Arrived Late For Our Commitments In London At Lunch Time.,,,,,
,4130,Better Dining My Experiance Was Enjoyable But Did Not Meet My Expectaitons Due To The Dining. This Is A Shame Because I Really Wanted Bovey To Be An Experiance That We Would Want To Do Again And Recomend To Our Freinds And Family But Sadly We Will Not.,,,,,
,4133,Check In Could Be Easier. Didn't Seem As Though The Reception Staff Were Very Bothered. Shame As All Other Staff Were Very Good.,,,,,
,4136,My Overall Experience Was Outstanding. I Did Not Really Need To Do Much Work Online  But Felt That Charging For Internet Access Was Odd. The Reliability Of The Access Was Appalling In Itself  And That's A Separate Point. The Notable High Was Your Superb Staff.,,,,,
,4143,Upon Departure Not Once Was I Asked Whether I Enjoyed My Stay - A Basic Question In Any Hotel,,,,,
,4147,Everything Was Very Good  But Very Let Down By The Experiance At Dinner. Also Would Like To Know Why When There Were So Many Rooms Available We Was Popped Into A Room With No View  Traffic Noise And A Very Loud Humming Noise.,,,,,
,4148,The Service Charge Was Automatically Charged To Our Bill  Is That Right?,,,,,
,4150,The Breakfast Service Was A Little Slow,,,,,
,4153,There Is So Much To Do And Offer. It Would Be Good For The Check Into Help Review The Options To Help Plan With The Castle,,,,,
,4155,No,,,,,
,4158,You Have A Beautiful Hotel. Just Felt That The Staff Did Not Care To Be Serving. Had To Wait For Meals Everywhere.. Like Being Back At Boarding School!. In All Other 5* Country Hotels We Have Stayed In Dinner Is Usually A Fab Experience. We Are Usually Taken To A Seating Area  Given Drinks  Canapes And Menus. When Ready Shown To  Our Table And Looked After Well.. You Really Need To Do Some Of These Things,,,,,
,4161,Have A Restaraunt That Lies In Standard Between The Two On Offer,,,,,
,4162,Had A Room Available On The Saturday Night So I Could Have Convinced My Husband To Ditch His Cricket Ticket For Sunday And We Could Have Stayed Another Night!,,,,,
,4163,On Demand Movies Was Not Working And Wewe Do Love Seeing A Movie At Night. We Never Got Offered Anything In Return. It Seems That Reception Did Not Even Know Becausethey Did Not Mention Anything Either.,,,,,
,4170,Staff In The Diningnroom Need To Learn To Smile  They Were All Very Dour  Except Russian Girl And Older Lady With Blonde Hair,,,,,
,4172,Food And Restaurant Staff Issues As Mentioned.,,,,,
,4175,I Organised The Whole Trip For All The Friends. We Arrived First In The Hotel  But We Had The Only Room Facing The Parkingplace. All Our Friends Had A Room With A Garden View...,,,,,
,4176,I Did Not Get An Option Not To Pay The Service Charge....,,,,,
,4177,Better Room  Improved And Consistent Service  Better Bathroom Etc I Have Already Written An Email With The Details.,,,,,
,4178,Exercise Classes I.E Yoga Or Pilates,,,,,
,4186,No  I Think You Have It Just About Right.,,,,,
,4194,During Our Stay There You Had The Lego Event But Unfortunately You Had Done A Groupon Offer Or Similar And There Were Therefore Far Too Many People For Us To Be Able To Take Part.  We Have Stayed At Bovey Numerous Times Over The Last Few Years And Feel That Whilst The Hotel Is Lovely The Management And Standards Of Service Are Dropping Which Is Disappointing And Making It Feel Too Expensive For The Experience.,,,,,
,4198,Some Nice Canapés In The Bar Perhaps With The Cocktails... Overall Was Very Good,,,,,
,4199,Complimentary Wi Fi Access Given There Was No Mobile Signal And The Room Rate Was Very Expensive. Think The Check Out Process Could Be Made More Efficient As There Was A Bit Of A Wait With Everyone Checking Out At Same Time,,,,,
,4204,A Few Small Things That I Mentioned Re Golf. Otherwise Nothing,,,,,
,4205,Train Your Restaurant Staff For High Dining In Welcoming Guests  Service And Etiquette. It Was Not Good At All!,,,,,
,4209,Hire Some Green Keepers Who Know How To Look After A Top Quality Golf Course  Not A Hotel Pay And Play!,,,,,
,4210,Nothing,,,,,
,4211,Nothing,,,,,
,4215,Bill Was Incorrect By More That £500 - Not Acceptable.  Had To Ask For It To Be Changed Twice.  Do Not Feel Convinced That We Were Charged The Correct Amount.  Service Charges And Extra Charges Should Be Put In One Amount Not Scattered Throughout The Bill.  Difficult To Know What You Are Paying For.  Left Us Disappointed At The End Of A Nice Stay And Felt This Was Unprofessional.,,,,,
,4220,Spa Use Re Tratments Was A Negative For My Other Guests Who Would Have Had A Few Each Of They Could,,,,,
,4224,Added Ferret Racing To The Daily Activities Sheet!,,,,,
,4225,No,,,,,
,4228,We Did Not Like The Additional Service Charge - We Always Give Tips And Did Not Like Being Told To Do So Even Though It Was Discretionary - We Would Have Felt Mean Saying No. If You Are Paying Over £3 For A Cup Of Tea Or Coffee A Free Refill Would Be Nice And Would Probably Encourage More People To Sit In The Lounges And Have A Drink Or Two.  Wifi - I Believe That Today Charging Excessive Amounts For Wifi Is Not Acceptable  And I Think Your Charges Are Excessive In This Respect  A Nominal Charge Would Be Better As You Only Charge This For The Access To The Fixed Computer . People Are Paying A Lot To Stay In Your Beautiful Hotel  So A Reduction In Wifi Charges Would Be Good.  ,,,,,
,4230,It May Seem A Silly Thing But There Was A Lack Of Newspapers. I Was Expecting To Find Some In The Dining Room To Read At Breakfast But They Were In Another Room. It Appeared That There Was Only One Copy Of Each So Although I Wished To Read The Times Another Guest Was Reading It. I Would Not Have Minded Paying For A Copy Of Paper If That Had Been Offered.,,,,,
,4232,The Restaurant Prices Are Far Too High And The Ambience Was Busy With The Tables Too Crowded.,,,,,
,4233,The Children's Clubs Were Cancelled.  This Was The Reason For Our Visit.  There Should Be Back Up For This.,,,,,
,4236,Staff Could Be More Attentive And Better Trained. Not All Need This  But There Is An Element In Your Staff That Definately Need To Focus.,,,,,
,4239,There Was A Shortage Of Newspapers  Only One Copy Of Each Title. This Felt Quite Mean Considering The Cost Of The Rooms. Maybe You Could Offer The Facility To Guests Of Being Able To Order (And Pay) For Their Preferred Paper And Then Have It Ready For Them At Breakfast.,,,,,
,4241,1) Improve Room Service 2) Give Me A Room With A Bath,,,,,
,4244,You Need To Excede Expectations For The Cost Of The Stay And You Just Dont Do That Compared To Other Slh We Have Stayed In The Setting Is Fantastic  As Is The Property But Your Service Lets You Down,,,,,
,4245,No.,,,,,
,4249,I Thought That The Property Was Beautiful And Well Appointed.  We Stayed For 6 Days And Brought Our 15 Year Old Son.  We Were Looking Forward To Spending Time Outdoors Playing Tennis  Badminton  Croquet Etc.  We Asked Repeatedly And The Equipment For Croquet And Badminton Could Not Ever Be Located.  The Tennis Equipment Was So Old And In Such A State Of Disrepair That It Was Not Usable.  The Tennis Courts Were Not Well Maintained.  There Was Not A Lot To Do Other Than Sports So We Were Very Disappointed To Not Be Able To Do Any Of These Things.  I Felt Like In General The Staff Was A Little Aloof Even Though They Were Polite.,,,,,
,4251,A Map Of The Hotel And Grounds In The Room Would Be Useful,,,,,
,4255,Maybe Extend The Kids Hours At The Pool Beyond 5:30.  And Offer Kids Movies Later In The Evening (7:30-10Pm).,,,,,
,4256,The Carpets Are Worn And Not Up To The Standard Expected Of Such An Hotel. The Outside Seating To The Bistro Needs To Have Sun Umbrellas Available  Particularly For Young Children But Generally For Anyone Who Wishes To Enjoy The Wonderful Location When The Weather Is Very Hot.,,,,,
,4262,Next Time We Will Stay In A State Room To Get The Full View.,,,,,
,4263,Please Sort Out The Dining....The Delays (Including Waiting 20 Mins For A Cup Of Tea At Breakfast) And The Lack Of Planning When An Event Is On Are Spoiling What Would Otherwise Be A Fabulous Experience.,,,,,
,4267,I Think The Discretionary Service Charges Should Be Clearly Labelled On The Account And The Exact Amount Of Service Charge Separately Itemised At The End . Assuming That Everyone Wants To Pay This Charge And Will Pay It By Default Is Unnecessary . If The Service Is Good You Can Be Assured That The Staff Will Be Rewarded . Does This Service Charge Actually Go To The Staff As A Gesture On Top Of Their Salary Or Is It Simply A Revenue Raiser ?,,,,,
,4268,Working Wifi,,,,,
,4269,Fell Below With The Food And Dining Experience Only Really. The Rest Was Wonderful.,,,,,
,4271,So Much Disorganization There! Activity Times Were Posted Incorrectly  Scones Were Frozen  Mistakes Everywhere. But We Still Had A Really Good Time.,,,,,
,4272,Bbq Was A Mess And When We Finally Got It Working The Bbq Tools Were Missing  Small Thing But Annoying. Otherwise We Had A Great Time,,,,,
,4273,We Were Not Informed That The Self-Service Buffet At Breakfast Was Not Entirely Continental And That Certain Items Had To Be Paid In Addition. We Were Even Charged For 2 English Breakfasts Ond Day Even Though I Only Had Toast That Day. On The 3Rd Morning We Were Told To Sign Our Breakfast Orders When Leaving The Restaurant. When Asking Why We Were Told That This Is To Make Sure We Pay What We Ordered. Very Strange  The First 2 Days Noone Had Cared About It. And Some Guests Left Without Being Asked To Sign. Very  Very Strange Indeed. The Final Account Was Very Confusing  As It Was Not Easy To Find Out What The Individual Items Were  E.G. The Items Of The Dinner At The Bistro Were Not Shown As A Whole But Split Into Food And Beverages So It Was Impossible For Us To Really Check The Bill Upon Check-Out.,,,,,
,4274,The Bill Was Incorrect As We Had Been Charged For A Meal Which Should Have Been Included. In Addition Not Clear Why A Service Charge Is Added For Room Rate.,,,,,
,4279,The Only Thing Was The Nagging Doubt About Running Up A Bill On What We Expected To Be A Free Holiday.£140 Was Put On Our Bill For The Spa Treatments But There Should Have Been Nothing To Pay As We Had Won £150 Of Treatments Per Person.This Was Removed Along With The Charge For Water And The Charge From The Meal For The First Evening When We Hadn't Yet Been Told About The £90 Limit.I Felt I Had To Keep Checking That Things Weren't Getting Added On And It Detracted From What Should Have Been An Amazing Relaxing Break.,,,,,
,4280,I Could Have Been Informed Correctly Of The Timings Of The Kitchen Fan! Good Customer Service Is Everything The Spa And Restaurant Were Excellent But Breakfast Was Not! They Need To Think About Getting The Basics Right.,,,,,
,4283,Not Really. Only There For A Few Days.,,,,,
,4285,To Know Who Was In Charge And For Someone To Oversee The Operation  My Husband Sat In The Bar For 20 Minutes Eventually Had To Get Someone  I Also Sat In A Lounge For 30 Minutes And No One Asked If They Could Get Me Anything,,,,,
,4286,No  Everything Was Perfect,,,,,
,4289,Time To Have A Good Look At The Detail.,,,,,
,4290,The Prices Charged Are For A Top Hotel Yet The Quality Of Staff Both In Numbers And Experience Falls Well Below Expectations And Other Equivilent Hotels .This Was Our 4Th Visit And Things Have Gone Down Hill - Only Regonised One Member Of Staff From Prevoius Visits Staff In Restruants Do Not Appear To Enjoy Their Work,,,,,
,4292,On Producing The Final Bill Your Receptionist Could Have Asked Before Running It Off The Computer If We Wished To Add In The Discretionary Service Charge  But We Were Not Asked And The Amount Was Just Added To Our Bill Without Our Approval. Not Wishing To Make A Scene At The Reception And Further Spoil Our Weekend (After The Fiasco With Our Dining Booking The Night Before) We Did Not Complain At Reception On Leaving (But It Is Highly Unlikely That We Will Ever Return To Bovey Castle Again  Given Our Poor Experience.,,,,,
,4294,Swimming Pool And Make The Final Bill Easier To Understand  Items Taken Off The Bill Were Not Marked With A Minus So Looked Like We Were Being Charged Again. Had To Add It Up In My Head Which Was Not A Good Thing.,,,,,
,4297,We Very Much Enjoyed Our Afternoon Tea  Perhaps More Sandwiches & A Little Less Cakes. But Beautiful Non The Less!,,,,,
,4301,Yes:  Housekeeping - Given That We Hand Our Keys In When We Leave  And You Know When We've Gone Down To Breakfast Or Dinner  Why Cannot This Information Be Shared With Housekeeping? There Was A Lot Of Unnecessary Disturbance And Housekeeping Couldn't Hear If  For Example  You Were In The Bath And Would Just Walk In. People Are Coming For Retreat  Recovery And Privacy And This Could So Easily Be Avoided.,,,,,
,4302,Improve Service Level In Any Sections,,,,,
,4303,5 Star Hotel Could Do A Better Job Concerning Service Competence. Afternoon Tea Was Excellent And The Hotel's Athmosphere Is Unique.,,,,,
,4304,Hotel Was Full So No Not Really. We Had An Awful Room Which Was Full Price. Felt A Bit Ripped Off To Be Honest.,,,,,
,4305,Attend To All Problems Mentioned.,,,,,
,4306,We Came To Stay With You So My Husband Could Attend A Board Meeting In Okehampton And I Could Relax And Enjoy The Spa Facilities. Due To My Failure To Obtain My 'Treatments' I Felt This Made A Huge Impact On Our Stay.,,,,,
,4307,Parking Next To The Lodge Would Have Been Very Helpful With A Baby. Many Others Did Park Outside Anyway. When The Lodge Was Unclean When We Arrived We Had To Chase To Get Thiungs Resolved. It Took Over 2 Hours.  The Lounges Were Great To Realx In. Having A Coffee Reading The Paper In The Quiet Was Excellent. The Falconry Was Good Fun.,,,,,
,4308,There Was A Mix Up With Our Luggage Which Was A Bit Of A Drama - We Had To Come Back To Get It As It Wasn't In The Car. Thank Goodness We Hadn't Driven All The Way To London!,,,,,
,4309,Yes  Need To Improve The Level Of Service To Deserve A 5 Star Rating.  Was 2 Star Experience For A 5 Star Price.,,,,,
,4310,It Is A Beautiful Venue. I Enjoyed The Ambience. The Staff Were Pleasant And Professional But Inexperienced So The Service Level Was Below Expectation. Inconsistency In Provision Small Things Like Biscuits Or Pillow Chocs One Night Not Another. Seemed All To Be Young And Less Supervised Than We See Elsewhere. Nothing Serious But Not 5* Level.,,,,,
,4311,It Would Be Nice If The Children's Play Barn Was Open Every Weekend  And Not Just Through The School Holidays. If This Were Not Possible  Perhaps Saturday Pm & Sunday Am.,,,,,
,4313,As We Had Booked A Dinner  Bed & Breakfast Package  The Final Account Was Not Entirely Clear As To Why And Where We Had Incurred Extra Charges.,,,,,
,4318,Provided A Clean Room.,,,,,
,4319,Absolutely Nothing It Was A Perfect Stay,,,,,
,4323,Delivered The Peace And Quiet And Golf That We Came / Paid For.,,,,,
,4324,The Additional Services Like Car Valeting Etc Were A Very Nice Touch And Extremely Reasonably Priced - £25.00 For A Full Valet.  Internet Was Easy To Access But Really Should It Be Charged - I Too Own And Run Establishments That Attract The Same Custom And Consider Free Internet As A Necessity These Days.,,,,,
,4325,I Felt That From Previous Visits Things Had Slipped A Little  Tables Not Cleared Very Quickly After People Had Had High Tea So Nowhere For Us To Sit. Not All Staff In The Bovey Uniform. Ashtray Outside Overflowing And Services In The Edwardian Very Very Slow,,,,,
,4327,The Hpotel Is Lovely & The First Time We Visited It Was A Great Experience  This Time It Lacked The Feeling Of A Quality Hotel & Although The Staff Were Really Nice They Need More Of A Focus On Delighting The Customer  After All If I Am Spending In Excess Of £1 000 For 2 Nights Away I Expect To Get What I Am Paying For  Which Is A Good Experience  This Time It Fell Short Of My Expectations & I Would Not Be Rushing To Return.,,,,,
,4328,No,,,,,
,4329,Some More Attention To Detail Throughout It Lets Down The Overall Splendour Of The Experience. The Bistro Management Needs Urgent Attention  It Let Bovey Castle Down.,,,,,
,4331,You Must Focus More On The Arrival Experience.  Perhaps It Is An Issue Between Portico/Er And Bovey Castle  But That Should Be Invisible To Guests.  While Our Trip Ended Very Positively  The Arrival  From An Arranged Car That Was Exceptionally Small That Picked Us Up At The Exeter Train Station To The Unprepared Room When We Arrived  Had The Potential To Derail A Long-Planned Family Vacation.  Again  If It Wasn't For The Efforts Of Federico Aresti  The Trip Would Have Been A Disaster For Us.,,,,,
,4333,Let Us Stay Another Night For Free!    Kidding  X,,,,,
,4334,Improve The Castle Bistro!,,,,,
,4338,On Arrival We Thought It Might Be A Bit Intimidating But All The Staff Made Us Feel Welcome And Were Very Friendly.,,,,,
,4341,Going Back To The Afternoon Tea Episode   Perhaps You Should Make People Aware When Booking That They Have To Pre Book Afternoon Tea  Or Like Us They Will Be Disappointed.,,,,,
,4342,I Did Feel That Service Was A Bit 'Hit And Miss'  And When Nobody Came To The Room At The End Of My Stay To Pick Up My Bags  I Just Thought It Was Easier For Me To Take Them Down Myself. Faster  More Attentive Service In The Edwardian Grill Would Have Been Nice. Didn't Like Having To Pay The 5% Service Charge On The Room!,,,,,
,4343,Do You Need The Service Charge? Although It Is Optional  It's Not Really Presented As Such.  And Do You Have To Charge For Broadband?  These Things Just Make You Appear Mean  Especially When The Stay Is Not Cheap.  These Things Stay In Your Mind Above The Good Service And Facilities.,,,,,
,4344,See Earlier Comments.,,,,,
,4346,As Already Mentioned; Provide Free Internet Access In The Hotel And Fix The Sauna!!,,,,,
,4347,A Little More Flexibility For Residents For Golf Facilities - Ie Free Driving Range And When The Course Is Very Quiet Late In The Day Accept Requests To Just Platy 3-4 Holes Rather Than Have To Pay For Minimum Of 9.,,,,,
,4348,We Were Surprised That There Was Only Very Limited Broadband Access In The Hotel Itself Or You Had To Pay For A Faster Speed And To Be Able To Download Attachments With Emails.  As We Run Our Own Business  It Would Be Helpful To Have Better Access To Broadband - Luckily This Was Fully Available In Rose Cottage  But We Would Expect Free Wi-Fi In The Hotel Too.,,,,,
,4350,The Standard Of The Lodge Should Be Much Higher  There Was An Empty Picture Hook In Our Bedroom! All Needs Decorating And We Wont Be Back Unless We Know It Is As Luxuious As The Price You Are Charging.,,,,,
,4351,Nope None At All    All Went Well And Better That Expected.,,,,,
,4353,We Ordered Breakfast In Bed (Which Incurred A £10 Supplement) And The Fruit Salad Etc Was Correct  But When We Sat At Our Little Table To Enjoy Our Cooked Breakfast (Before Going To The Hawk Display) The Order Was Completely Wrong - Someone Else's Order.  We Had To Phone Down And Wait For Correct Breakfast To Come And Hurriedly Eat It  And We Were Then A Bit Late For The Hawk Display.  Also The Breakfast Was Not Up To Standard.  The Sausages And Bacon Were Tepid And Felt Like They Had Been Sat In A Bain Marie (And Not A Very Hot One) For Ages (Ie Cooked A While Ago).  The Bacon Was Tough And Chewy.  One Of My Poached Eggs Was Perfect And The Other Was Like A Hard Boiled Egg.  There Was No Ketchup/Mustard/Salt/Pepper On Offer Either.  Very Below Par.,,,,,
,4355,The Final Account Was Not Broken Down  Particularly The Restaurant Bill So It Was Not Possible To Check It For Accuracy.,,,,,
,4356,Sadly I Would Improve Your Own General Manager And If It Is He That Reads This I Trust He Will Take Note. I Specifically Spoke To Him/You And Explained How We Had Been Made To Feel Very Second Rate To Your Conference Guests Despite The Value Of Our Booking. He Listened And Assured Us He Would Speak To His 'Events' Team And Get Back To Us. Well He Has Not  And For That I Would Not Recommend Your Hotel To Any Of My Business Colleagues  Which  As A Director Of A Major Fund Management Company Publicly Listed  Is Not Inconsiderable. Your General Manager Fell Substantially Below The Standards Of His Own Staff And I Trust Should He Read This  Feel Genuine Embarrassment. You Cannot Propose To Run A 5 Star Hotel And Leave Your Guests Disrupted By Conference Visitors. Poor Management And Poor Arrangement  Easily Resolved By Attention To Detail And Consideration.,,,,,
,4357,Improve The Breakfast Experience.,,,,,
,4358,Better Explanation Of Facilities  Positions On Arrival Would Have Been Good.  E.G Where Was The Edwardian Grill  And What Where The Pre Dinner Arrangements?,,,,,
,4362,No,,,,,
,4363,There Was A Lot  So Much  I Will Not Make An Attempt To Write It Down. There Are Some Few Members Of The Staff Who Know What They Are Doing; The Vast Majority Has Obviously Not Had Any Training And Experience In The Past  And Nobody Is Teaching Them How To Do Better Than They Do  So Everything Will Stay As Bad As It Is.,,,,,
,4364,We Had Been Recommended To Try You  We Could Have Been In A Travel Lodge At Times. Shame There Isnt A Big Enough Market For Such A Place Without Having To Attract The Masses.,,,,,
,4370,Yes Everything.  But Just Meeting The Basics So Easily Achieved By Premier Inn Of A Clean Room In Working Order And Staff That Know What They Are Doing Should Be Your Initial Challenge.  To Be Honest My Daughter Accommodation At Exeter University Last Year Was Of A Higher Standard Than Your Room.,,,,,
,4372,English Speaking Staff Are A Must.,,,,,
,4375,Some Proper Kitchen Knives That Were Sharp  Not Bent And Fit For Purpose. Bathroom Shower Door Did Not Close Flooding Bathroom Each Time. No Frying Spatular. Very Limited Crockery For 6 People. This Lodge Was Really Lacking In The Kitchen Area. The Sauce Pans Are Laughably Small For A Family Of Six And Just Not Enough Of Them. Need Someone To Ga And Have A Good Look At The Utensils Etc With A Full Lodge In Mind.,,,,,
,4376,I Had Mentioned To The Receptionist That My Sister Would Be Visiting And That We Would Be In The Library  So When She Arrived Could Be Directed In My Location.  When My Sister Actually Arrived She Was Told To 'Just Wait In The Bar As They're Probably In There'.  When Going Back To The Reception  She Was Told To Just Look Around And Will Probably Find Us Somewhere! On Checking Out  I Noticed That We Had A £50 Charge For Smoking In The Room.  When My Partner Asked To Speak To The Manager About This We Were Told To Sit Down And That He Would Come Out In A Moment To Speak To Us.  We Waited For 1 Hour And Realised That He Had No Intention Whatsoever To Speak To Us To Clear Up This Matter!,,,,,
,4377,Not Really As We Enjoyed Thoroughly .,,,,,
,4378,Provide Coasters In The Room So There Are No Water Marks On The Furniture,,,,,
,4381,Ask That Guests With Children Avoild The Room Where Weddings Take Place.    Could Hear One Screaming Outside While We Were Listening.  Also Too Many Small Misbehaved Children Generally,,,,,
,4382,I Think I Have Covered Most Things That Bugged Me!,,,,,
,4385,I Wonder About This. I Tried For Months To Work Out My Situation Reasonable With Your Hotel  With You  Mr. Aresti  With Various Members Of Management  All To No Avail  So I Simply Wonder If There Is Anything You Can Do  Because You Never Were Open To My Calls  And Never Offered Me Any Assistance  But Simply Passed The Situation On To A Group Of People Who Were Not Being Responsive. To Me  It Appears To Be A Demonstration Of Incredibly Poor Management. I Truly Do Not Know What Else To Say.,,,,,
,4386,The Service Charge Was Not Described To Me As Discretional At Any Time - It Was Simply Explained That There Was A 5% Service Fee - On Reflection I Think This Should Not Haver Been Charged.,,,,,
,4393,Does Exactly As It Says On The Tin. Charming Place Ozzing Character & History. No Changes Required.,,,,,
,4396,At No Time During My Stay  Or Checking Out Was I Asked If Everything Was To My Satisfaction,,,,,
,4400,Train Staff In Breakfast Area As It Was Not Busy And Free Tables But There Was Still A Wait And Finally Once Seated Had To Wait For Basics Like A Cup Of Tea,,,,,
,4403,I Was Happy With The Final Account  But There Appeared To Be A Lot Of Duplicate Entries Which Took A Lot Of Study Before I Was Happy With It.,,,,,
,4404,I Still Do Not Know Where The Spa Is To Be Found. No Indications Anywhere To Find Out About It. Also  No Mention Where To Find The Tennis Court. The Tv Is Rubbish And The Cost Of Watching Movies Exorbitant.,,,,,
,4405,This Was Our 3Rd Visit But The First Time We Did The Guided Walk. Think For People With Dogs It Was Perfect And Would Live Some More Options Like This To Chose From.,,,,,
,4408,Please Reference My Letter Sent To Hotel Manager Who Didn't Even Bother To Reply!!,,,,,
,4411,Taking On The Service Charge Was A Surprise- We Already Tipped Staff.,,,,,
,4412,A Proper Clean-Up Of The Rooms As Well As The Public Areas.,,,,,
,4415,On Arrival And Again When We Returned To The Hotel After Being Out On Saturday We Wanted To Park The Car At Front Of The Hotel Along Side Others Parked There  But The Staff Said We Couldn't And They Would Valet Park Car. Looking At The Cars That Were Allowed To Be Parked At The Front It Was Mercs Land Rovers And Porsche - Perhaps Our Bmw Despite Its Private Registration Number Was Not Considered Good Enough!!,,,,,
,4416,I Did Not Realise That The Service Charge Was Discretionary. I Thought It Was A Bit Rich Bearing In Mind That We Had Booked Dinner  Bed And Breakfast To Have The Service Charge Added To Our Evening Meal And Drinks. This Should Be Made Clear Right From The Start.,,,,,
,4418,Watching Youtube On The Room Television Was Frustrating... The Bandwidth Couldn't Cope (And Controlling It Was Entertaining... Any Chance Of A Keyboard?)  Apart From That I Genuinely Can't Think Of Anything... Which Is Saying Something! Oh  Maybe A Few More (Complete) Board Games To Play On Wet Days.,,,,,
,4419,Improve The Service In The Edwardian Grill. Staff Did Not Seem To Have Set Tables And Were Not Being Led Effectively By A Maitre'd.,,,,,
,4420,Improve....Read Your Reviews On Trip Advisor And Bring The Standard Up.,,,,,
,4421,Free Wifi,,,,,
,4422,Grounds Are Very Golfer-Friendly. Walking Around Made Me Feel As Though I Was 'Intruding',,,,,
,4424,Food In General Especially Breakfast Poor Service In Restaurants,,,,,
,4426,For The Manager To Have Known Our Names And Had A Proper Chat Perhaps.  To Know More About The Owners/Management Ethics Etc Etc Might Have Been Interesting.,,,,,
,4427,The Sales Pitch And Price Is Considerably Above What Is Delivered.  I Have Been Fortunate To Stay In A Number Of Quality Hotels And Was Expecting More In Terms Of Facitlities And Service.  We Are A Sporty Couple And Were Looking Forward To A Good Swimming Pool And Gym.  In Reality The Pool Was Short And Ill Suited To Swim Training  And The Gym Was A 'Store Cupboard' Full Of Fancy Kit But Without Natural Light  Ventilation Or Somewhere To Stretch.  The Service Was Impersonal And The General Impression Was To Bill You More For Everything You Do.   The Room Was Comfortable - But What I Would Expect For A Standard Room And Not 'Special' For The Extra Money.  We Did Make Sure We Enjoyed Our Stay And The Quality Of The Food Was Fabulous.  I Am Happy To Pay Extra For Something Special  Here We Paid A Lot Extra For A Good Experience Rather Than A Great One.  In The Previous 3 Days We Stayed In A Hotel In Wales At Half The Room Rate Which Was A Much Better Experience  Mostly Due To The Personal Service.  ,,,,,
,4428,We Didn't Realise The Drink Was Excluded From The Dining Offer We Had  Which Led To Some Confusion And Probably A Missed Dessert!,,,,,
,4436,The Only Reason  Why Our Stay Didn't Exceed Expectations  Is Because We Have Stayed With You Before  So We Knew What To Expect. We Just Love The Atmosphere Of The Hotel In Its Breathtaking Setting.,,,,,
,4440,I Understand That Sometimes  Due To High Customer Numbers  Dining Rooms Are Challenged...But Cooking And Serving Edible Food That Is On The Menu Should Be The Minimum Expectation Of A Hotel Guest.,,,,,
,4441,Put Us In A Better Room  Made Dining Bill Clearer  As I Expected To Be Paying Difference Between £60 Allowance And Final Bill When In Fact We Had Only Had £50 Worth Of Food But Alcohol Could Not Be Offset Against The Rest. Also Wine Slightly Overpriced,,,,,
,4442,It Was Such A Beautiful Day And There Was Only A Deck Hair To Sit On Which Was A Bit Disappointing But That's The Only Thing I Could Comment On,,,,,
,4445,Fell Below Initially But Did Improve.,,,,,
,4446,Remove Rubbish And Crocorey Quicker- Wehad Some Outside The Lodge For A Day Even Though We Phoned,,,,,
,4447,Our Only Complaint Is Really The Standard Of Dining In The Bistro. We Loved The Hotel Design  The Swimming Facilities  The Situation  And Found Our Room Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,4448,Cleaned The Fridge In My Room Before Arrival -  Checked The Bedspread As There Were Orange Stains (Like Juice) On The Underside (Before We Arrived) - Moved The Cot Out When Asked - Put Lime In My Drink - Provided A Few Armbands Etc For Children In The Pool Area - Made An Effort To Give Me The Message That My Daughter Was Tired And Needed Fetching From Playroom - Been Able To Provide Skimmed Milk In The Bistro For Coffee (Apparently There Wasn't Any - This Could Have Been A Language Problem),,,,,
,4449,See My Previous About The Slack Service.  I Expected More Efficient.    We Would Have Liked To Have Been Served A Drink Especially As We Verbally Asked As The Bar.,,,,,
,4450,See My Email To Joanna.,,,,,
,4453,I Thought The Over All Experience Was Good  The Decor Was Beautiful Throughout  Although The Carpets In Public Areas Esp Near The Bar Looked Like They Needed Some Attention.,,,,,
,4454,No,,,,,
,4457,Breakfast And Quality Of Rooms Need To Be Improved.,,,,,
,4459,Comments As Before. Staff Need To Be Better Co-Ordinated And More Continuity Might Avoid  Some Of The Problems We Experienced,,,,,
,4461,Changed Rooms Or Turned Off The Source Of The Background Noise At Night.,,,,,
,4462,Internet And Telephone Reception Was A Major Issue. Service In Castle Bistro Was Very Slow/ Poor. Also We Had Some Sort Of Extractor Running Up Through Our Room Which Was Noisy Until Late In The Evening And We Felt There Was Excessive Noise Very Early In The Morning   Approx 6Am From I Presume Maintenance Vehicles  Which Made A Lie In Impossible,,,,,
,4469,Use Less Paper When Printing Bills!,,,,,
,4470,Improve Restaurant Service. I Also Had To Go Looking For A Member Of Staff To Get A Drink At The Bar As It Was Deserted  Also The Same Problem When Sitting Outside. The 'Excuse' Was That They Were Very Busy. This Comment Was Interesting  But Not My Problem  As A Guest.,,,,,
,4471,It Was Very Good To Find A Chargeable Torch Provided In The Lodge  However  The Lighting Outside From The Castle Terrace Steps To The Lodges  Was Not Good. We Noted That There Was A Light Here  That On Previous Visits Was Working  But Not During This Stay. An Improvement Was The Additional Lights Outside The Lodges On Our Way Back To Ingle Tor  Ie By Hound Tor Etc.,,,,,
,4472,Room Description Inaccurate,,,,,
,4474,Better Quality Tv Would Have Made A Difference.,,,,,
,4475,Cleaner Facilities.  Pool Area Dirty.  Showers Very Dirty-Full Of Soap Scum  Hair Balls,,,,,
,4477,As Previous,,,,,
,4478,Reception Staff - Excellent  Waiting Staff Need Training And Leadership,,,,,
,4479,Free Wi-Fi Would Have Been Nice  Given The Overall Cost And Other Services Provided Within The Hotel.,,,,,
,4480,We Ordered Tea And Toast At Breakfast And The Waitress Served Our Order To Another Table  A Couple Who Had Only Just Sat Down  So We Were Left Waiting For Service.  However This Was Rectified By The Manager And Was Only A Minor Pitfall.,,,,,
,4481,Loved The Pool And The Falconry Displays....Loved The Candles In The Sitting Room In The Evening,,,,,
,4483,Cooked Breakfast Was Of Poor Quality  The Bacon Being Inedible,,,,,
,4485,Some Quiet Music While Having Cream Teas In Front Of The Fire Would Have Made It More Enjoyable,,,,,
,4488,A Couple Of Minor Points. There Was No Butter Or Preserves At Breakfast  And We Did Not Get Our Wake Up Call As Requested. Luckily  We Woke Up Anyway.,,,,,
,4490,The Problem With Setting Really High Standards Is That Anything Less Can Be Disappointing. If I Hadn't Experienced Such Good Service Previously  I Probably Wouldn't Have Felt Disappointed And It Would Have Been Nice If We Had Had Some Sense Of Special Service Because Of The Family Occasion.,,,,,
,4493,Dont Use Foul Words When First Meeting A Guest. Dont Serve Burnt Food,,,,,
,4496,The Food Needs To Be More Accurately Described When Deconstruction Or Changes Of A Popular Dish Are Going To Be Served  Its All About Meeting Expectations. Ie If You Fancy A Bouillabaisse  And It Says Its A Bouillabaisse On The Menu  You Really Don't Want Sashimi On A Hot Plate With Tomato Bisque  As Nice As That Would Be If You Wanted That. Same For A Lot Of The Other Dishes On The Menu. Plus The Prices Are Very High. We Have A Restaurant That Serve Several Of The Same Wines As You  We Make The Standard  70%+ On Ours But Your Prices Are Nearly Double Ours!  ,,,,,
,4499,No-It Was Perfect,,,,,
,4501,The Water In The Pool Was Cold And One Of The Two Showers In The Mens Changing Facility Was Not Working Properly - I Think There Was A Door Missing.,,,,,
,4503,See All Previous Comments.  Also The Bathroom Was Of Poor Standard  Layout And Quality.  The Room Was Dusty.,,,,,
,4504,No,,,,,
,4505,The Stated Price Online Is A Sham When You Add 12.50% To Everything .This Added Over £50 To The Final Bill .With A Bill Of Over £500 I Do Not Expect To Pay For Papers In The Morning. At Breakfast The Fruit Salad Was Frozen And Plates Cleared Whilsty Wife Was Still Eating.My Cooked Breakfast Arrived Whilst I Was Still Eating My Fruit.The Servers Phone Also Went Off Whilst Serving Us.On Checking Put We Then Had To Wait 20 Mins For Our Bags To Be Bought Down .In The End The Receptionist Had To Go And Get Them.This Is Whilst You Had Four Waiting Staff Doing Nothing In The Restaurant.We Were Truly Disappointed With The Overall Experience .You Are Over Priced For What You Are Supplying And Require More Supervision And Training.We Are Staying At Rick Steins This Evening And At Gidleigh Tomorrow. I Am Sorry To Say That I Feel We Will Have A Better Time And Receive Value For Money.It Explains Whilst I Accept It Was Monday It Was So Quiet.,,,,,
,4506,The Staff Lived Up To Expectations  But The Building Did Not. The Plumbing And General Wear And Tear On The Furnishings/Carpets  Left Some Things To Be Desired.,,,,,
,4507,Clean Rooms-Upholstery Better Furnishings In Bedrooms Listening And Dealing With Concerns Better Service Generally,,,,,
,4508,I Thought An Automatic Discretionary Service Charge On Every Part Of The Bill Was Excessive And So We Only Elected To Pay One Of Them. Perhaps Someone Not As Diligent In Reading Their Bill/Terms Of Stay; Or Too Embarassed To Delete Them  Would Have Paid More Than They Would Have Wished?,,,,,
,4510,Provide Free Wifi Provide A Tv That Works Provide A Bed That Is Fit For Purpose In A Hotel - It Was The Worst Bed I Have Ever Had The Misfortune To Lie On - I Ended Up Sleeping On The Couch. When Making The Booking The Bed Was A Key Factor.,,,,,
,4511,Restaraunt Staff Needed To Be A Bit More Helpful,,,,,
,4512,Shown Around The Hotel On Arrival,,,,,
,4517,Billing Prodedure At Breakfast Took Almost As Long As The Tea,,,,,
,4518,Breakfast Experience Was Dissapointing  Plates Were Cold And The Waiter Forgot To Take Our Orders. Choice Of Breakfast Was Very Limited With No Kippers Or Oilly Fish Avaialble. Didnt Like The Variations In Costs It Gave The Impression The Hotel Was Trying To Make Money Any Way It Could.,,,,,
,4520,At Breakfast  Coffee Was Served Cold And Far Too Strong. I Sent It Back And It Returned Exactly The Same  Cold And Far Too Strong. On The Third Attempt It Was Different Coffee And Acceptable (From An Espresso Machine Nt Filter Coffee). The Waiter Should Have Checked The Temperature And Strength Before Delivering The Second Time.,,,,,
,4521,Food Being Available Outsidee Of The Grill On An Evening And A Better Experience In The Grill. This Did Spoil Our Stay At The Hotel,,,,,
,4522,Dinner Experience  Better Decorated Room: More Expensive Light Fittings  Better Rug On The Floor (Current One Has Folded Corner And Does Not Look Good)  Better Carpet In The Room And New One On Stairs To 3Rd Floor (Red One Horrible And Damaged),,,,,
,4523,Asked If We Wanted A Paper Delivered To The Lodge At Book In.,,,,,
,4526,See Comments Above - Staff Service Could Be Improved,,,,,
,4529,The Furniture Everywhere In Public Spaces Is Tired And Worn And Need Cleaning/Reupholstering Or Replacing. Time For A Refresh.,,,,,
,4530,Only My Observations Previously Mentioned,,,,,
,4531,See Previous Comments.  Some Issues With Room And Some With Service At Dinnner.  All Issues Relatively Minor And Probably Wouldn't Warrant Comment At A 2 Or 3 Start Hotel.,,,,,
,4533,Please Continue To Hire And Retain Your Exceptional And Caring Staff!  They Are The 'Human Face' Of Bovey!,,,,,
,4534,Made It A Bit More Challenging To Steel Golf Buggies,,,,,
,4537,Yes !,,,,,
,4538,On Early Departure  After Our First Night  Due To A Family Emergency  The Manager Still Wanted To Charge Me The Full 3 Nights. Only After Some Uncomfortable Conversation Did He Agree To Charge Me For 2. Outrageous Customer Service And Rude Individual. I Will Be Taking This Up With Tablet Hotels As Well As American Express. Where Was The Christmas Spirit?  Greed...An Ugly Thing,,,,,
,4539,1.  Charging An Optional 5% Service Hidden In The Terms And Conditions Again Felt Wrong.  I Didn't Pay  I Would Have If You Had Simply Built It Into The Rack Rate  Or Were More Explicit When I Booked.  It Was 5% On Everything That Moved  Again If You Want To Attract The Right Customer Base  Be Transparent  Charge More And All Will Follow. A Really Disappointing End To The Visit.,,,,,
,4542,One Of The Dressing Gowns Left In The Room Was Dirty And Below Standard.  I Think It Had Been Washed So The Stains Were Obviously Hard To Shift But I Still Think That It Shouldn't Have Been Left For Someone To Use.  One Of The Bulbs In The Ceiling Light Was Out.  I'm Surprised That These Aren't Checked Before Guests Arrive.,,,,,
,4543,Figuring Out The Children's Activities Was Difficult And In Particular The Activities Of Bovey Rangers Versus Play Barn.  My Son Is 5 And My Daughter 10 And It Was Not Clear That My Son Could Also Take Part In Activities Such As The Treasure Hunt On Halloween.,,,,,
,4548,A Few Thing Went Wrong - The Meat Cooked Not To Instructions - The Afternoon Tea Was Served With Mustard On The Ham And Horseradish When This Was Requested To Be Served Plain - Had To Ask For Sugar  Small Things But Added Up,,,,,
,4549,Please See Earlier Comments,,,,,
,4551,Better Attention To Detail,,,,,
,4553,Pre-Warned That A Wedding Was Booked For That Weekend  And As Such Given Us The Opportunity To Change Rooms.,,,,,
,4554,Good To Be Able To Make Hot Drinks In The Room But Please Provide Milk As Well As Cream (Nobody Likes Cream In Tea) And Also There Was Nowhere Convenient To Put Used Tea-Bags.,,,,,
,4555,Provide Lighting On The Paths Down To The Lodges.  Confirm The Name Of The Lodge Together With The Lodge Reference  Rather Than Justhe Reference Number As This Isn't Shown Anywhere.  Clean And Illuminate The Lodge Names So That It Is Possible To Find Them.,,,,,
,4561,The Possibility To Get For The Breakfast  An Afternoon Tea Or Dinner Into The Castle. To Get The Breakfast We Had To Pay For. Not Get Through The 'Back Entrance' To Our Accommodation.,,,,,
,4562,Yes Very Very Dissapointed,,,,,
,4564,I Thought It Was Very Expensive Ultimately And Lacked The Feeling Of A Very Expensive Hotel. I Thought The Interior Design Was A Little Lacking And Whilst Very Comfortable For People With Small Kids I Would Rather Not Have Small Boys Going To The Toilet In The Steam Room  No Lockers  No Towelling Robes In Our Room. \We Waited A Long Time For Our Food In The Bar And The Bistro And Had To Prompt Staff Continually.The Reception Did Not Make Our Reservation We Had Asked For. One Night We Just Left The Bar As We Coldnt Get Service. The Georgian Room Food Size Was Really Dissapointing And The Breakfast Were Ok But Again Too Much. I Have Visited Many Hotels And Feel That The Vision For Excellence Is Somewhat Lacking. Sorry  I Hope This All Helps In Someway.,,,,,
,4565,Improve The Food.,,,,,
,4567,Restaurant Staff Could Have A Little More Training; Improve Taste/Flavor Of Foods; Work On Fresh Air In Room.,,,,,
,4568,Service Charge Is Controversial But Often We Found The Service Slow And We Waited To Be Seen In The Various Rooms And Bars Often So Charging For Service In Addition To The Room Rate Is Unusual And Unjustified,,,,,
,4572,No. Love The Palce As You Already Know. Ag,,,,,
,4574,The Basics Of Hot Food Was All That Was Required And You Fell Short.,,,,,
,4583,When We Left There Was A Charge On The Bill We Couldn't Identify.  The Staff Couldn't Give Us Any More Detail And Said We Should Settle And They Would Be In Touch To Confirm What It Was But We Haven't Heard Anything?,,,,,
,4584,Well - Given My Description So Far I Think You Can See How The Experience Could Be Improved.  The Lack Of Greeting Followed By The Lack Of Bags  Then The Wait For The Meal  Then Another Wait For Afternoon Tea  Then A Final Blow Of A Breakfast Order Being Actually Lost... Not A Good Experienc And Most Definitely Not Worth The Bill Of Over 700 Pounds.  Like Most People We Work Hard For Our Money And Do Not Spend This Amount Lightly.  We Have Always Seen Bovey Castle As A Real 'Treat' And In The Past This Has Been Justified.  This Time Frankly It Felt Like A Complete Waste Of Hard-Earned Money.,,,,,
,4585,None,,,,,
,4589,Our Was A Business Event  And Our Company Rules Do Not Allow Us To Pay Service Charges,,,,,
,4590,Aspirin Or Parecetemol With Breakfast Would Have Been Welcome But This Is Just For Me.,,,,,
,4592,Have Already Made A Range Of Comments.,,,,,
,4593,We Were Very Shocked At The 12 And A Half Percent On All Food And Drinks. This Is Not Made Clear Anywhere On Your Website Or At The Hotel. That Is Definately Overcharging.,,,,,
,4595,As Previously Stated,,,,,
,4601,Good Experience Except For The Menu Planning,,,,,
,4602,Redecorate The Rooms. Not Leave Breakfast Trays Outside Rooms At 4Pm. Not Locate Rooms Next To Lift. Have A Better Cooling System In Rooms. I Could Go On......,,,,,
,4605,I Think I Have Already Mentioned Everything Elsewhere.,,,,,
,4607,Although The Overall Experience As Such Was Excellent  We Were Unhappy With The Way That Unexpected Extra Charges Kept Appearing  Such As The Automatic  Albeit 'Discretionary'  Extra Charge Every Time We Did Anything.  We Had Been Advised That An Extra 5% Would Be Added To Our Accommodation Bill  But As It Turned Out   That Was In Addition To The 12.5% We Had Already Paid On The Main Parts Of Our 'Relax' Package.  We Felt This Smacked Of Very Sharp Practice  And When I Queried It At Our Departure  I Did Not Receive A Very Satisfactory Answer  And Was Disinclined To Ask For It All To Be Taken Off As Obviously That Would Impact On The Amount The Staff Would Get  And They Had Been Very Good.,,,,,
,4608,Local Map. Better Food.,,,,,
,4611,Better Lighting From The Lodge To Hotel.,,,,,
,4613,I Appreciate That The Hotel Is Known Predominantly For Golf  However  It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had An Area Of Grounds To Walk (Garden?) Where One Could Avoid The Possibility Of Flying Golf Balls..Not Everyone Will Be There For The Golfing Experience  As In Our Case. Also  A Warning When Making One's Journey To The Hotel That Sat Navs Can Take You Via The Very Narrow Single Track Lanes Which Are Impossible To Navigate When A Car Appears From The Opposite Direction!Rather Than The Main Road.,,,,,
,4614,Service In Bar Area/Afternoon Tea Very Disorganised,,,,,
,4615,The Front Of House Staff And Spa Therapists Are Excellent But The Waiting Staff Need To Be More Alert To The Subtle Signals That Indicate That The Residents Would Like Service Or Attention.  At Times It Felt Like We Were Rather Intruded Into Their Home And They Rather Wished We Would Go Away!,,,,,
,4616,We Would Have Liked To Have Seen Some Lighter Options On The Evening Bistro Menu  Whilst We Have Already Mentioned The Issue With Spa Treatments  It Definitely Affected Our Overall Impression And Experience Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,4618,You Need To Train Your Waiters To Be Less Forgetfull And More Professional . They Were Not Up To The Standard We Were Expecting,,,,,
,4622,If Reception Staff Are Basically There To Keep The Accounts And Process Paperwork Then They Should Make Sure They Introduce Guests As They Arrive To A Welcomer Who Shows Guests Around The Hotel Facilities And Answers Any Immediate Questions And Informs Guests Where And How Any Further Questions Can Get Answers.,,,,,
,4626,The 'Discretionary' Service Charge Was Pretty Much Compulsory. The Staff Training Really Needs To Up Its Game,,,,,
,4627,Yes Ensure Your Staff Are Able To Deal With Clients Of All Backgrounds - Not Just People That Act As If Money Is No Object!!!,,,,,
,4629,Breakfast Could Have Been Better,,,,,
,4630,Plenty.,,,,,
,4632,Apart From What I Have Already Described With Regard To The Bedroom Faults And The Breakfast Being Late I Was Also Disappointed With The Pool Facilities.  At The Time Of My Visit The Steam Room Was Not Working And There Seems Only To Be Some Of The Jets Working From The Jacuzzi?  This Is Not What I Was Expecting.  The Towels Also Seem To Be Of An Inferior Quality Than When I Last Visited And The Pool Area Was Quite Wet And While I Was There A Young Child Fell Over  Even Though She Was Being Very Careful To Walk Slowly.,,,,,
,4634,No -Just Keep Up The Fantastic Customer Service Levels.,,,,,
,4640,I Stayed 2 Nights. The First Morning I Went To The Restaurant I Joined My Brother And His Wife At Their Table Which Was Set For 2 People. I Was Not Asked If I Would Like Breakfast. I Had To Request Coffee And When It Cam Had To Then Request A Cup And Saucer. I Was Not Invited The Menu. I Helped Myself To The Buffet And Had To Take Cutlery From Another Table.,,,,,
,4641,Put More Standard Tea Bags In The Room  As Opposed To Just 2 Of Each.,,,,,
,4643,Access To The Pool For Disabled People Was Difficult And Near Impossible For My Husband.  A Small Discreet Pool Side Hoi Would Have Made Access And Exit So Much Easier For Him.  He Found Getting Out Of Othe Pool Very Difficult And Did Not Go In A Second Time Because Of This.  Bearing In Mind He Had Had A Severe Stroke 12 Months Earlier This Would Have Been A Real Pleasure For Him Had It Been More Accessible,,,,,
,4644,Oiled The Bathroom Door Hinges,,,,,
,4648,I Felt The Hotel Was Too Eager To Charge For Every Little Extra. To Charge For Hiring A Few Cold Clubs To Use The Driving Range And Other Little Examples Just Left A Bad Tast. Charge A Lot For The Hotel But Then Don't Be Petty,,,,,
,4649,All The Activity's We Did Were Good Fun  (Clay Pigeon Shooting  Cocktail Making  And Sloe Gin),,,,,
,4651,As Usual We Had An Excellent  Relaxing Time At Bovey Castle  We Were Asked To Move As People Had Booked Afternoon Tea In The Sitting Rooms. I Do Understand This As I Know You Need To Make A Profit But They Seemed To Be Given Preference Over Residents.,,,,,
,4654,Perhaps The Background Music In The Bar Could Be Changed Regularly  We Heard The Same Music For Four Evenings!,,,,,
,4656,All Ready Mentioned. The Pool Area Needs Improvement  The Beds And Better Cooking In The Bistro,,,,,
,4657,The Only Comment Would Be When We Ordered Tea And Coffee On The Terrace Outside  In The Afternoon. We Had To Ask For Hot Water  We Had To Ask For A Tea Strainer (As Loose Leaf Tea Is Used) And The Cake Arrived A Good Five Minutes After The Drinks This Did Not Pose A Problem To Us But I Consider It Should Be Mentioned.  Otherwise A Great Stay And We Will Be Looking For Future Offers.,,,,,
,4658,I Feel You Need To Remove The Discretionary Service Charge. It Is Unnecessary And Out Of Line With Other Leading Hotels In The U.K. And Abroad.,,,,,
,4659,No,,,,,
,4660,We Disliked The Continual Background Music And Found It Intrusive  This Together With ? Boiler Noise Made It Less Relaxing Than Anticipated.,,,,,
,4661,Housekeeping Needs To Be Improved In Bedrooms And Public Areas. The Breakfast Was Awful As Leaving Food Uncovered Means Flies Can Walk All Over It. Seeing This During Our Stay Meant I Did't Enjoy The Breakfast Experience.,,,,,
,4666,The Discretionary Charges Should Only Be Added To The Bill After Consent From The Clients.  Querying The Charge Only To Be Told That It 'Can Be Removed If We Don't Want To Pay' Causes Embarrassment All Round Especially If Other People Are Checking Out At The Same Time.  This Is The Only Reason I Paid The Charge! Although My Room Was Clean And Well Appointed As Previously Mentioned I Had A View Of The Roof!,,,,,
,4667,Be Up Front And Honest With What You Are Offering On Travelzoo Deals.,,,,,
,4670,Improve Service In Restaurant.,,,,,
,4674,I Think The Petite Fours Were Bland  And Nothing Special   You Pay For Special You Should Get Special .,,,,,
,4675,Staff Training To Check They Can Fully Desribe A Meal (E.G. 'Salted Caramel Ice Cream' Instead Of ' Something Caramel': I Would Have Made A Different Choice If It Was Described Properly. No Personal Comments Needed  Just Politeness Would Have Made It A Perfect Visit.,,,,,
,4678,The Tea Was Excellent But The Breakfast Lacked Passion.  It Did Not Feel As Though Someone Had Thought The Whole Thing Through.  It Was Fine But Miles Adrift From The Tea,,,,,
,4679,As With Previous Stays We Found The Level Of Standard To Be Very High And Are Very Appreciative To All Your Staff. Staying In The Lodges Means That You Don't Interact With The Staff Quite As Much  However When We Did They Were Always Helpful.,,,,,
,4683,Nothing,,,,,
,4685,Although Service At The Wedding Reception Was Good  General Waiting Service Was Very Bad - Whether It Was At Breakfast Time Or Getting Tea/Coffee In The General Lounge/Bar Areas With Long Delays  Getting Orders Wrong Etc. Ot Really Let Down What Could Therwise Have Been A Very Good Response.,,,,,
,4687,Stayed From Friday To Sunday Everything Excellent On Arrival But By Sunday Breakfast Felt That We Had Outstayed Our Welcome.,,,,,
,4688,No  Everything Was To The Highest Standard.,,,,,
,4691,Let Me Know My Room Number Before I Check In,,,,,
,4695,Only Air Conditioning  Which May Not Be Practialble!,,,,,
,4697,This Is Not A Major Criticism  But I Was Slightly Disappointed With Breakfast Service - And With The Range Of Food On Offer - But I May Not Have Had That Explained To Me That We Could Order From The Kitchen - Staff Were A Bit Thin On The Ground - We Had To Ask 4 Times For Coffee! That Said - This In No Way Reduced Our Total Enjoyment Which I Would Score At 99/100,,,,,
,4698,No,,,,,
,4699,There Were Many Misunderstandings Which Resulted In Missed Transfers  Wrong Accommodations  Wrong Food Orders.  The Staff Were Friendly  But For The Most Part  Poorly Trained And Very Inexperienced.  English Comprehension Was A Constant Problem.  It Would Help A Great Deal If All Requests Were Confirmed In Writing And Food Orders Repeated Back.  Many Mistakes Could Have Been Caught.,,,,,
,4700,I Do Not Agree With The Discretionary Service Charge.  I Appreciate The Sentiments Behind It But It Does Take Away The Ability Of Residents To Award Was Is Considered To Be Exceptional Service And Not Reward For Possibly Poor Quality Service.  In Addition  It Add Considerably To The Overall Cost And Whilst It Is Discretionary It Puts The Resident On The Spot To Actually Delete It From The Bill.  This Needs Rethinking. ,,,,,
,4702,The Service In The Bistro Needs To Be Improved.,,,,,
,4704,I Didn't Realise I Was Actually Paying A Discretionary Service Charge - I Assumed From The Bill That This Was A Fixed Charge And Was Rather Surprised That Even Our Rooms Had Had An Additional Charge Applied.,,,,,
,4706,Shower Was Drafty  Tub Too High  Toilet Raised Up And Behind Behind Bathroom Door  Had To Ask For More Than One Towel Per Person  Room Was Cold And Drafty,,,,,
,4710,I Am Concerned About Question 26.  I Was Told That The Service Charge Was Included In The Room Rate So We Did Not Pay Any Extra Or Leave Money In The Room.  The Service Charge For Drinks And Food Was Clearly Stated And Very Reasonable.  I Think The Whole Tip Situation Needs To Be Better Advertised (Not Just A Sheet In The Back Of The Leather Room Folder).  The Service Deserved Recognition And I Feel Badly If We Were Misinformed.,,,,,
,4713,Better Service In Restaurant At Breakfast. Unable To Get A Table For Afternoon Tea As They Were All Reserved. Voucher Included Falconry Experience Which Was Also Fully Booked. We Weren't Informed That Prior Booking Was Required For Either Event.,,,,,
,4715,Why Weren't The Lodges Numbered?  I Had To Go Back To Reception To Get Assistance. (When I Went Back In The Receptionist Kept Saying 'Your In B1' Which I Knew As It Was On My Key Ring/Had Be Told At Booking In. As I Kept Saying To Her 'I Know That! What I Don't Know Is Which Lodge Is B1 As They Don't Have Numbers!' Meanwhile My Wife And Young Son Were Waiting In The Cold. Have You Ever Parked In The Car Park Took A Load Of Your Bags Out And Tryed To Find B1 In The Cold. Do It And You'll Find Out How Stupid It Is.,,,,,
,4716,Please Refer To My Comments About Evening Dining At The Edwardian Room - I Would Most Definitely Taken This Further Had My Wife Not Been With Me. Ensure That Somebody Is In Charge Of Ensuring That Children Respect The Hours Of Admittance To The Swimming Pool.,,,,,
,4717,Yes Not Stayed At All. Had A Better Meal In Widdicombe.,,,,,
,4718,The Service And Food Did Not Meet The Standard You Would Expect From A Five Star Hotel.,,,,,
,4719,The Hotel And Staff Are Very Good But The Breakfast On Both Mornings Was A Disaster.  On Saturday Morning There Was No Management Presence And No Organisation.  It Took 1 Hour And 10 Minutes To Get Breakfast.  We Received Earl Grey Tea Instead Of English Breakfast Tea.  The Table Was Laid With Soup Spoons For Cereal/Fruit.  There Was An Array Of Crockery Designs (Not Expected In This Quality Of Hotel).  There Was A Marked Improvement At About 10.00 Am When The Executive Chef Arrived And Started To Organise Things.  On Sunday Morning The Wait Was Shorter But The Service Was Poor.  Coffee Was Delivered Instead Of Tea.  No Marmalade Or Jam On The Table.  There Was Lack Of Glasses On The Fruit Juice Station And The Replenishment Of The Buffet Table Took Some Time Hence My Wife's Smoked Salmon And Scambled Eggs Arrived Before She Had A Chance To Eat Her Fruit.  The Young Ladies  Who Appeared To Be Order Taking/Supervising On Both Mornings  Were Doing There Very Best And Were Very Polite But There Just Appeared To Be Chaos With No Organisation.  ,,,,,
,4721,More Beforehand Information.  Not Told Would Need To Book To Take Tea In A Grand Room.  We Had To Go To The Upmarket Mcdonalds Room.  The Bistro.  We Sat At A Non Reserved Table To Be Told It Was Reserved And The Waitress Had Forgotten To Put A Sign On It. In The Restaurant Our Choice Of Wine Was Sold Out And The Bread Was Dry. The Food Was Mediocre And Not Up To Its Hype Or Price.,,,,,
,4724,We Were Very Disappointed That We Could Not Go With The Birds Of Prey.  This Was One Of The Main Reasons That We Came To Your Hotel.  If Items Are Put Up As Available Then They Should Be Available Or Much More Detail Given About Booking The Service.,,,,,
,4727,Finding It Very Hard To Think Of Anything Else We Could Have Wished For  Was Also Happy To See The Fires Lit All Day.  At T His Time Of Year It Is Not Often Seen And Was Lovely.,,,,,
,4728,No  I Have Grumbled Enough. Overall We Thoroughly Enjoyed Staying At Bovey And We Will Return. Just The Couple Of Things We've Mentioned Already  If Addressed  Would Have Made It A Perfect Stay,,,,,
,4732,The Staff Need To Be So Much More Attentive To The Hotel Visitors.  Waiting 20 Minutes To Be Served In The Bar Is Not Acceptable And Some Need To Try To Appear To Enjoy Their Job  Even If They Do Not.  Your Hotel Is A Service Industry And Visitors Are Paying For A Pleasurable Stay.,,,,,
,4734,We Were Disappointed That We Had To Dine In The Bistro And Small Dining Room Rather Than The Main Dining Room Because Of The Wedding Display And Conference  And Thought That We Could Have Been Offered A Complimentary Room Upgrade To Make Up For Our Disappointment.,,,,,
,4737,Appreciate That There Are People Staying In Your Hotel Who Are Not Large Groups Of Americans And Russians Who Also Require A Bit Of Tlc.,,,,,
,4738,Ensure Staff Do Not Make Excessive Noise During Night Hwe Do Not Feel Ours. Unfortunately We Could Hear Loud Conversations From Reception Into The Early Hours.,,,,,
,4739,I Don't Think So. We Enjoyed Our Mini Break Very Much And It Did'nt Rain All The Time!,,,,,
,4740,Could Have Offered Us A Better Room.  We Were Advised If We Wanted To Pay More We Could Have A View.  On The Basis That We Had Already Paid A Considerable Sum  I Felt The Failure To Proffer The Better Room Which Was Clearly Available Reflects Poorly On The Standard Of Customer Service.,,,,,
,4743,Better Dining Experience  And Sort Out The Breakfast Issue.,,,,,
,4744,Fufil Customers Pre Arrival Requests  Improve The Service In The Bistro Better Supervision,,,,,
,4746,Improve The Bistro As It Is Not Up To The Standard Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,4747,Had To Wait For Well Over An Hour For My Room As Was Told That It Would Be Available At 1Pm,,,,,
,4748,The Food And Service Needs To Be Improved  Based On The Very  Little Food We Ate There  It Was Not Of A 5 Star Establishment  Hence Why We Cancelled Our Evening Meal At The Edwardian And Went To Eat Out Locally.  The Decor In Both The Castle Bistro And The Edwardian Grill (Why The Grey Screens??) Needs Attention To Make Them More In Keeping With A Castle Atmosphere.,,,,,
,4749,There Was A Problem Checking Out Which Delayed Our Departure,,,,,
,4750,The 12.5% Service Is An Anachronism - If You Want More Money Then It Should Be Included In The Price - Not As A Sneaky Add On! Ok I Know It Enables You To Fiddle The Vat But You Only Have To Read Trip Adviser To Learn What Others Think About It - It Isn't About Absolute Amounts Of Money Or Value For Money It's The Presentation,,,,,
,4752,I Feel My Experience Was Spoilt On Arrival.  We Felt Overlooked.,,,,,
,4753,Golf Course Was Not In Very Good Condition  More Work Needs To Be Done On It  No Distance Markers And Genereal Condition Only Average  Poorly Signed  I Expected More And The Reason For Stay Was The Golf Which Was Disapointing,,,,,
,4756,Sunshine Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,
,4757,Absolutely Nothing.,,,,,
,4758,In With Our Offer Was Afternoon Tea Which We Had Difficulty In Getting A Table As We Were Not Advised We Had To Book. However  One Of Your Staff Kindly Sorted For Us. I Would Like To Thank Her But Didn't Get Her Name Buthad Long Blonde Hair And Appeared To Be On Duty In The Reception Areas.,,,,,
,4759,As Mentioned Above  Breakfast Was Very Poor.  I Know That It Was Included In Our Overall Deal (Along With One Afternoon Tea Which Was Excellent)  The Breakfast Was Very Poor In All Aspects Ie Choice/Presentation/Service.  The Staff Were Very Polite But Slow And Seemed Disorganised.,,,,,
,4763,We Arrived On A Sunday Afternoon Which Was Very Busy With Afternoon Teas - The Standard Of Dress For Some Customers Was A Let Down When Other People Had Made Such An Effort For A Beautiful Setting. Overall Ambience Was Noisy And Busy Rather Than Relaxing - Not Alot Of Room Left For Sitting.,,,,,
,4764,Decaffeinated Tea Or Redbush Tea In The Bedroom. A Complimentary Spakling Wine Or Similar Would Have Been Nice For Our 35Th Wedding Anniversary,,,,,
,4765,A Site Plan Or Map Of The Grounds Would Have Been Useful. We Could Not See One In The Guide In Our Room.,,,,,
,4766,Guest Room Was Too Noisy.  Would Have Much Prefered A Real Jacuzzi In The Pool Area.,,,,,
,4768,The Luggage Was Put Into The Car (Van) And It Was Put In Front  But When We Left There Was Nobody To See Us Out  Say Goodbye Or Wish A Good Trip.,,,,,
,4769,Biking Is A Listed Activity - There Were No Bikes. Asked For The Loan Of A Rucksuck- There Were None. However  Our Request For The Use Of Iphone Charger Was Met.,,,,,
,4771,The Overall Experience Was Excellent,,,,,
,4772,Employ Competent Staff Or Train Existing Staff,,,,,
,4778,Although Dining Was A Good Experience  Breakfast Was Not What We Would Have Expected From A 5 Star Hotel. Not Greeted As We Entered The Restaurant  Long Wait For Tea And Coffee  Table Not Cleared Between Courses And No Acknowledgment As We Left.  We Used The Self Service Buffet But Noticed A Number Of Guests Having To Ask For Bowls  Plates  Juice Etc To Be Replenished.,,,,,
,4779,Staffing Levels Appeared Low  But Most Of The Staff Did Their Best.,,,,,
,4780,I Think You Should Up The Professionalism Of The Staff,,,,,
,4782,The Final Bill Included A Round Of Golf  Which We Had Not Participated In.  That Was Removed From The Bill When We Pointed It Out. Overall  I Was Disappointed.  I Made The Reservation To Celebrate A Birthday  And Was Willing To Pay The Very High Price  Because I Thought Staying In A Castle With A 5 Star Rating Would Be Wonderful; Certainly An Experience Which I Wouldn't Be Able Enjoy At Home In The Usa.  The Grounds Did Not Disappoint.  They Were Beautiful And Well-Kept.  The Interior Lovely In Places  And Shabby In Others.  I Found That The Rugs Over Carpets Were Often Rumpled Which Caused Me To Be Continually Nervous About The Possibility Of Tripping.  Hardly Relaxing.  I Also Think That It Is Misleading To Call This Building A 'Castle'.  It Is In Reality  A Country Home.  All In All The Prices Charged Were Not Only Excessive  They Were Exorbitant.,,,,,
,4783,The Final Bill Included A Round Of Golf Which We Had Not Participated In.  That Charge Was Removed When We Pointed Out The Mistake.  We Were There With Another Couple Who Were Given A Room On The Third Floor.  I Never Saw This Room  As I Am Unable To Climb Stairs  However I Have Been Told That This Room Was Not At All As Comfortable As Room One.  The Room And Bed Were Small And Cramped And The 'View' From The Window Overlooked The Gutters And Roof Of The Adjacent Building.  The Rate For This Room Was The Same As For My More Spacious Room On The First Floor.  My Friends Were Very Upset About The Condition Of Their Room And The Money Charged For It  As Am I.  It Was My Idea To Book This Hotel; A Mistake Which Will Not Be Repeated.,,,,,
,4784,It Was A Lovely Visit & We Enjoyed Ourselves There. However The Service At Meal Times Was Not Great. For The Cream Tea We Received The Scones  Jam Etc Quite Promptly  But The Tea Didn't Arrive Until We Had Eaten Most Of It And Some Of The Tea Ordered Did Not Appear. I Have Mentioned The Service At Dinner & Breakfast Previously. There Were 11 Of Us In The Group  But I Feel You Should Have Been Able To Cope With This.,,,,,
,4785,Improve Quality Of Rooms,,,,,
,4786,Room Of That Size Could Use Double Sinks In Bathroom And A Larger 'Proper' Shower So That Water Doesn't Go Everywhere.,,,,,
,4787,Have More Variety In Dinner Menu In Edwardian Grill.  Have More Kitchen Staff On Duty At Breakfast.,,,,,
,4790,When The Property Is Sold It Will Be So Important For Everyone To Remain And To Allow Jeremy To Run It The Way He Knows How To As He Is One Of The Best In The Business,,,,,
,4794,Initial Imressions Were Excellent But The Room Was So Poor For The Rate That It Devalued The Whole Experience Had They Not Been Closed For A Private Function We Should Have Stayed At Coombe House So Your Offering Was In Practice A Huge Disappointment By Comparison Despite A Personal Reccomendation From A Reliable Friend Who Has Stayed With You,,,,,
,4795,Upon Departure We Were Informed That Our Car Was Somewhere Outside And We Could Come Back If We Could Not Find It. At The Door There Was Nobody To Say Goodbye And Certainly Not Have A Good Trip And See You Back Soon. Message Understood.,,,,,
,4796,A Room Decorated And Maintained To An Acceptable Standard Would Have Been Good. We Only Stayed With You As Both Coombe House And Gidleigh Park Were Full And Friends Recommended Bovey Castle As A Pleasant Place To Stay.,,,,,
,4797,The Carpets On The Stairs To Our Room Were Threadbare And Needed To Be Replaced,,,,,
,4799,I Think I Have Said It All  Just A Pity That A Hotel That Is Meant To Be The Creme De La Creme  And Charges Those Prices Is Not Perfect   You Cannot Have Room For Error When You Claim To Be The Best  You Have To Be The Best.,,,,,
,4801,Everything Was Done Perfectly In Our Case From Allowing Us To Park Our Car Conveniently In Front To Presentation Of Afternoon Tea  To Dinner Service  To Check Out.,,,,,
,4803,At Noon On Saturday We Were Promised That Our Room Was Being Held For Us For The 2 Day Nye Package By A Member Of Your 'Events' Department And So We Went To Torquay To Buy The Clothes Necessary.  On Our Return We Were Advised That Our Room Was Not Available And Furthermore There Was No Room Of That Category Available Either. A Huge Disappointment Following The Previous Excellent Experience.,,,,,
,4807,The Sommelier  George  Did Not Really Listen To What We Asked Him About Wine Recommendations,,,,,
,4808,Your Staff Were Exceptionally Good With My Elderly Parents  A Big Thank You Them All  Also To The Bird Man Who Kindly Took The Eagle Inside So My Father Could See It.,,,,,
,4809,For What You Charge I Feel The Rooms Should Be Far More Luxurious Which Could Be Done Without Losing The Character Of The Building.  My Overall Impression Was Of A Rather Well Used Shabby Building.  We Are Used To Staying In 4 And 5 Star Hotels All Over The World And Felt That Breakfast Service Was Poor  One Waitress Had A Large Stain On The Side Of Her Skirt  I Had To Ask A Member Of Staff To Fill The Orange Juice  (This Should Have Been Checked And Done Without Being Asked)  The Breakfast Itself Was Ok  Although I Have Had Just As Good At Some Bed And Breakfast Accommodation.  Our Dirty Plates Were Left On The Table And Not Cleared For A Long Time (Although The Restaurant Was Not Full). Overall Very Average  Which Bearing In Mind The Hype About Bovey Castle Being Something Special  Was Very Disappointing.,,,,,
,4811,The Transport Charges To And From Ring Of Bells And The White Horse In Were Insanely High For So Short Journets In Both Time And Distance.  A More Reasonable Charge Would Make Guests Feel A Whole Lot Less Exploited.  You Could Provide Sevreral Sets Of Adjustable Walking Sticks So As To Better Take Advantage Of The Wonderful Walks Available Off The Castle Grounds.,,,,,
,4812,My Children Would Have Liked Better Mobile Phone Coverage But The Lack Of It Suited The Parents.,,,,,
,4816,Arriving Late  At Night It Was Great To Have Such A Warm Welcome  Fire Blazing,,,,,
,4824,We Very Much Enjoyed Our Stay The Hotel Is Very Relaxed . Our Only Slight Critiscism Was A Lot Of Staff In The Dining Room Who Were Rather Over Attentive Making Us Feel Slightly On Edge. We Would Have Been Perfectly Happy To Have Poured Our Own Wine/Water At Our Own Pace.,,,,,
,4830,Dining Room Open For Monday Lunch - We Were So Tired We Got Up Late And Fancied A Good Lunch Before Heading Home But The Main Dining Room Was Closed.,,,,,
,4831,The Hotel Is Lovely  And Staff Are Great. However  Bearing In Mind That This Is Quite An Expensive Hotel  It Needs A General 'Touch Up' So That Little Things Like Blocked Plug Holes And Cold Radiators Don't Detract From The Experience.,,,,,
,4832,Improve Service At The Bar And Breakfast. Reduce The Cost Of Meals Or Raise The Bar Even Higher.,,,,,
,4833,Apart From My Comments My Stay Was Excellent And As Good As It Was Previously. I Have Already Recommended Your Hotel To Several Friends And Family Members.,,,,,
,4834,Only The Soap Holder,,,,,
,4836,Room Service: I Ordered A Soft Drink For My Daughter Twice. It Failed To Arrive Both Times  Finally Coming After My Third Request. Breakfast Service Was Shambolic - There Was Complete Failure To Deal With Simple Requests For Eggs To Be Served 'Sunny Side Up'  Toast To Be Served Well Cooked (Ie Crisp And Brown  Not Just As Limp  Warmed Bread)  And Coffee To Be Served Hot With Hot Milk. In Breakfast Everything Fell Short Of Expectations And Consequently We Chose Not To Try The Restaurant For Dinner. In The Bar It Was Not Always As Easy As It Should Be To Attract The Barman's Attention.,,,,,
,4840,When We Checked Out I Asked For My Bags To Be Brought Down From The Room – After 20 Minutes I Had To Go Back To Reception And Make The Request Again – I Waited Outside With My Car Boot Open And The Engine Running – After 15 Minutes I Went Back Inside The Find My Bags Just Dumped Inside The Front Door – I Picked Them Up And The General Manager Came Over To Help Me – Not The Kind Of Service You Would Expect From This Price Of Hotel – I Have To Say That Although I Got A Deal On The Rooms The Incidental Costs Boosted By The Service Charge Made This Stay As Expensive As Gidleigh Park And I Am Sorry To Say The Service  Food And Ambiance And Peace And Quiet Are Ten Time Better - The Friday Night Was Exceptionally Noisy With Scores Of Children Running Around Banging Door And Making Noise – Not A Five Star Experience,,,,,
,4841,Give Fast Wifi Free In The Room Price - The Slow / Free Wifi Is Unusable And A Cheapens The Whole Experience,,,,,
,4843,No,,,,,
,4844,Fish Was Ordered Yet No Fish Knives Were Provided  Yet When Steak Was Ordered Steak Knive Arrived - Just A Point Of Etiquete,,,,,
,4850,I Would Like To Have Been A Little Less Invisible At Breakfast Time,,,,,
,4856,Not Really,,,,,
,4859,We Enjoyed Thoroughly - Very Good Breakfast As Well - They Brought Car Round And Defrosted It For Us Before Departure Too,,,,,
,4863,No,,,,,
,4866,Wife Came And Did Not Bring Swimwear. Had To Visit Shops In Totnes! ,,,,,
,4867,Other Than The Points Highlighted In Previous Questions  All Good.,,,,,
,4868,No,,,,,
,4869,Parking Seems To Be An Issue  It Was Not Explained Until Later In The Day  At Which Point We Moved Our Vehicle From The Front To The Side. A Simple Sign Explaining Things Would Have Been Helpful,,,,,
,4870,See Earlier Comments. I Would Undoubtedly Have Indicated That Our Experience Exceeded Expections But For The Issue With The Room In Particular.,,,,,
,4872,The Decor In The Lodges Is Looking Very Tired Now Eg Torn Seats,,,,,
,4886,None It Was A Great Experience.,,,,,
,4889,No,,,,,
,4890,Perhaps The Gym Could Be More Spacious,,,,,
,4895,No,,,,,
,4897,The Only Issue. During The Afternoon. There Was Nowhere To Sit In The Hotels Beautiful Rooms As All Of The Tables Were Reserved. There Should Be A Small Percentage That Are Available For Guests To Enjoy.,,,,,
,4901,Better Coordination With Lodge Guest Arrivals So That They Are Personally Taken To The Lodge By A Staff Member.,,,,,
,4904,Regular Cider Needs To Be Available At All Bars,,,,,
,4905,Teach Beaky Another Word!!!!,,,,,
,4906,Nothing Except What Has Been Previously Mentioned.,,,,,
,4915,Nothing Above That I Have Already Detailed.,,,,,
,4918,Grab Rails For Bath Larger Portions Of Hot Breakfasts  Especially The Fish Element,,,,,
,4936,Not Good Value For Money ,,,,,
,4937,The Hotel Was Very Over Heated.,,,,,
,4940,No,,,,,
,4942,No,,,,,
,4946,Not Really  Just Carry On Doing More The Same. ,,,,,
,4949,No,,,,,
,4952,Although Overall Stay Was Very Good We Were Disappointed With Unexpected Service Charges For Room Housekeeping  Bar Drinks  Cocktail Making Etc. Which Totalled Over £50  I Would Have Thought We'd Paid Enough For Service Without These Additional Charges,,,,,
,4954,No Keys Available For The Lockers In The Ladies Changing Room.  Not Because It Wsa Busy  Apparently Some Of The Keys Have Not Been Returned And Therefore The Lockers Are Out Of Action.,,,,,
,4955,Previous Comments Cover Everything. We Were Made To Feel The Service Charge Was Pretty Much Obligatory,,,,,
,4971,The Coktails Could Gave Been Worth £15 ,,,,,
,4974,Slow Service  Spoilt What Would Be A Perfect Location  And Stay   Plus The Mattress Issues As Already Stated ,,,,,
,4975,No,,,,,
,4981,Have A Wider Range Of Meals Including Halal Food ,,,,,
,4983,Didnt Really Experience Enough Of The Venue Etc To Comment,,,,,
,4985,Moved Us To A Decent Room  We Had Worked Hard All Year And Do Not Usually Spend That Amount On A Room And Did Not Feel Special As We D Hoped,,,,,
,4986,The Wedding Planner Was Kind Like She Couldnt Be Bothered  We Asked Three Times To Let Her Know We Had Arrived  She Didnt Sell The Place At All  She Wasnt Much Interested In Us Nor Showing Us Arround  The Reception Knew There Was An Error In The Booking When We Arrived And We Didnt Have Children Yet The Bill Had A Child Supplement,,,,,
,4987,Although We Did Not Mind Paying The Service Charge We Thought It Was A Bit High And Could Be Brought Down Slightly ,,,,,
,4990,As Mentioned Before - Running Water. Cinema Room. More Evening Entertainment.,,,,,
,4992,No - The Best Hotel Experience In He Uk,,,,,
,4994,Found Our Stay A Little Short On Information  Possilby The Tv Could Be Used To Update On Services  Times  Internet Access And Account Charges.,,,,,
,4996,The Service Charge Is Off Putting. Given That Bovey Castle Charges So Much  Guests Shouldn't Be Expected To Pay For Elements Such As Staff Development. At Night In Particular  Something Like A Cinema Room Would Be Good Or Other Form Of Group Activity. After Dark  Unless Eating  Drinking  Reading Or Board Games  There Isn't Much To Frame The Evening Into A Memorable Experience.,,,,,
,4997,There Seemed To Be Only One Place We Could Walk The Dog Off The Lead - Along The Footpath To North Bovey Which Is A Shame Given All That Space - If There Were Other Walks We Didn't Know Of Them.  It Was Very Good To Have Dog Bed  Bowl  Treats And Towels Already In The Room On Arrival  And Would Have Been Useful To Have Been Told On Making The Reservation That They Would Be Provided And It Could Have Been Advertised On The Website ,,,,,
,5009,A Sixfoot Bed As Requested On First Floor.,,,,,
,5011,Was Not Told Beforehand About Charge For Dog So It Came As Shock,,,,,
,5014,Give More Information About The Problems With Your Water Supply. Have More Checks In Place For Housekeeping.,,,,,
,5015,See Earlier Comments,,,,,
,5016,Make It Easier To Turn Off The Fire In The Lodge And The Lock In The Front Door Of Our Lodge Was Difficult To Operate,,,,,
,5018,Teach Your Staff To Be Friendly.   Some Are Very Good  But Some Just Stare At You.  I Assume That Some Do Not Speak English  As We Did Notice That The Majority Were Foreign  But They Could Smile Without Speaking.  Many Many Years Ago I Was A Receptionist In A 5* Hotel In Tunbridge Wells.,,,,,
,5019,No,,,,,
,5020,I Slightly Felt The Valet Service Was Overprice And  Not Explain As Courtesy Service Charge. Meaning I Felt Now Knowing It Was A Service Charge And Members Of Staff Are More Willing To Help Me Out My Car. I Hope That It's Not The Case Just Goodwill Service Of Wanting To Help The Customer To Part My Car.,,,,,
,5022,We Were Flooded-Out Of Our Bed And Room On The Second Night Of Our Stay.The Hotel Was Unable To Satisfy A Request For Clean Pyjamas To Replace Sodden Nightware. We Were Re-Roomed  But On The Following Morning Found No Water Supply In The Bathroom At 9.30Am. On Neither Occasion Was Any Member Of Management Visible. We Received Neither An Apology Nor Any Compensation For Our Multiple Inconveniences In Our Final Account. ,,,,,
,5024,Not Really...,,,,,
,5030,The Water Was Dirty For Bath And Shower - Not Very Nice.,,,,,
,5032,I Booked A Massage But Had To Ask Three Times For A Robe As There Was Not One In My Locker  Was Told There Was  And Then Was Given A Towel Not A Robe.,,,,,
,5036,Improve The Restaurant And Dining Options. ,,,,,
,5039,No - Apart From Lose The Noisy Balloons At Xmas Day Lunch (Very Annoying) ,,,,,
,5040,See Comments Above . Also Small Thing But Want Clear That We Would Be Charged (£20!) For A Return Lift To Ring Of Bells.,,,,,
,5044,Welcome Drinks E.G Mulled Wine On Arrival Or Tea And Biscuits Maybe  Also Clearer Signage And Directions As Not Easy To Find Especially In Dark With No Sat Nav !,,,,,
,5051,Find The Discretionary Service Charge Difficult To Understand For An All Inclusive 3 Day Package And Is The One Thing That Would Stop Me Coming Again ,,,,,
,5052,For Christmas Package The Children Really Got Together More Following The Team Work In The Survival Skills Outdoors Session On Boxing Day. Might Be Worth Considering A Childrens Event On Christmas Eve To Get Them All Started? ,,,,,
,5053,There Was A Bit Of A Sense That Those Not On The Package Were 'Second Class' Citizens Such As When We Asked Having Coffee In The Lounge We Were Told That This Was For Those On The Package - However  We Were Told We Could.  The Meal In The Bistro Was Poor But I Am Sure In The Dining Room Was Far Better I Would Imagine - Would It Be Worth Considering Offering People The Opportunity To Eat In The Main Restaurant Or Alternatively Ensure That The Food Is Of A Lot Better Quality ,,,,,
,5055,I Can't Think Of Anything.,,,,,
,5057,Just Please Pay Careful Attention To Our Other Comments Above. ,,,,,
,5062,Everything Was Incredibly Well Organised And The Service Really Professional.,,,,,
,5063,No,,,,,
,5069,Sink Some Money Into The Hotel And Return It To Its Former Glory!!!  It Is Very Sad That Is In Such Bad Shape  Although It Is In A Beautiful Part Of The World.  The Rates Are Very High For What It Has Become.  We Just Stayed In Suites In Central Paris In A Modern Hotel In Pristine Condition For Less Than A Castle Room!   Hence  You Are Really Overpriced!!,,,,,
,5070,Offered Some Discount On The Rubbish Night Sleep We Had For A Room Costing £320 That Has A Broken Window Seal.   All Other Trips To Bovey Castle Been Great.,,,,,
,5071,As Our Expectations Were Very High  It Was A Shame That The Few Small Points I Have Mentioned Occurred.  This Slightly Tarnished Our Stay.  Although The Staff Were Lovely And Very Polite At All Times.,,,,,
,5072,More Things For Children,,,,,
,5073,Ensure All The Lodge Facilities Worked  More Explanation Of Recycling And Collection Of Rubbish .,,,,,
,5074,I Was Disappointed To Find I Was Not Told Of The Wedding Party At The Hotel On The Day We Were There. It Was Almost Impossible To Find Anywhere To Sit Or Stand For A Great Part Of The Day Which Given The Amount Of Money We Spent There I Found Very Frustrating - It Would Have Been Really Helpful If When We Booked We Were Told About The Wedding And Advised To Pre-Book Seating In The Various Lounges. We Felt We Were Given Very Much Second Class Status.,,,,,
,5089,Nothing At All,,,,,
,5095,We Would Prefer Standard Coffee Sachets Available In The Bedrooms.,,,,,
,5098,We Did Not Pay All Of The Service Charge (Eg - Not On The Spa Treatments Etc....),,,,,
,5103,Refurbishment Of Bedrooms. ,,,,,
,5104,Not Really - Except Perhaps Arrange For The Sun To Shine And Stop The Weather From Resembling A Biblical Flood!!,,,,,
,5105,The Weather Wasn't Great When We Were There Especially On The Last Day; If We Had Been In The Hotel For The Day (Because Of The Weather) I'm Not Sure What We Would Have Done With Our Day (And It Doesn't Seem Right To Read/Watch Tv For The Day) Perhaps A Lecture On Dartmoor Or The Estate Or Something More Practical Like A Visit To The Wine Cellar Could Be Be Put In Place To Fill Up A Bit Of Time On Days Like That.,,,,,
,5106,This Is A Suggestion That Only Affects The New Year Package But It Would Be Very Helpful To Have An Itinerary That Is More Clear And Only Mentions The Items That Are Included In The Package And Not Those That Aren't As It Was Very Confusing.,,,,,
,5110,The Timings Of Children  In The Pool Rule Was Understandable But A Bit Of A Pain As We Have A 16 And 13 Year Old (Both Being Well Behaved ) And I Wonder If The Rule Could Be Relaxed When Things Are Very Quiet As They Were. (We Kind Of Ignored It A Bit Anyway- Sorry!),,,,,
,5111,New Activities Please,,,,,
,5115,All Good  Would Have Loved To Play Golf But Not Possible Due To Rain So Walked To Pub ... No Hardship There !,,,,,
,5120,My Husband Would Like To Point Out The Poor Air Quality In Our Lodge Due To The Boiler Fumes.  We Had To Keep The Door Closed In This Room  And Couldn't Use This Bathroom And Room.  The Boiler Needs To Be Looked At.  The Fumes Effected The Health Of My Son.,,,,,
,5123,Attention To The Information Provided Ahead Of Event And Detail Around Mass Catering.,,,,,
,5126,See Previous Points. I Wouldn't Pay The Full Rate To Stay At Bovey And Don't Think I'd Stay There Again With Another Deal  Either - Sorry. The Rooms Were Great And It's A Lovely House Which Makes For An Interesting Experience  But Overall We've Enjoyed Better Stays In Less Glamorous Surroundings.  It Probably Just Wasn't To Our Tastes As We Prefer Somewhere A Little More Relaxed  But That's More Of A Reflection On Us Than Anything You Did Wrong  Particularly - It Seemed To Be Somewhere To Go If You're A Little Bit Older  A Little Bit More Affluent And Probably From North London.,,,,,
,5131,It Is A Shame That If You Do Not Require Tea  You Are Asked Not To Sit In The Large Hall To Read The Papers. I Imagine This Is To Leave Space To Serve Teas When The  Hotel Is Full. However  When Half Empty  Perhaps The Staff Coud Be More Flexible. I Realise There Are Other Places To Sit  But The Fire And Surroundings Are Attractive.,,,,,
,5134,Non  But Probably A Map To Get There Could Be Fine  It Was A Little Difficult For Us. We Arrived By Behind The Property  But It Was Nice...,,,,,
,5138,Absolutely Nothing!,,,,,
,5139,Yes. Parking Spaces Were In Very Short Supply. Given There Is No Where Else To Park  And I Suspect It Is Often Raining  This Is Not The Ideal Welcome.,,,,,
,5140,No - Entertainment Great  Firworks Great  Food So So (Soup Very Salty) Bedtime Chocolates Appreciated,,,,,
,5144,Not Aware Service Charge Was Discretionary !!! ,,,,,
,5152,No,,,,,
,5154,No  You Thought Of Everything,,,,,
,5157,Having A Seperate Jacuzzi Pool.  Also The Swimming Pool Water Could Have Been Slightly Warmer,,,,,
,5160,My Friend Had Called Up And Booked And Paid For Afternoon Tea As A Birthday Present But No One Told Us And As We Didnt Have Phone Reception Didnt Know!,,,,,
,5166,It Was A Bit Annoying That Other People's Used Glasses  Cutlery And Crockery Were Not Promptly Cleared Away Even After We Had Ordered And Received Our Own Order. Invest In More Packs Of Cards - Only One Pack With 3 Cards Missing!  Perhaps Acquire A Couple Of Scrabble Sets/ Other Games.,,,,,
,5167,No,,,,,
,5168,If We Had Been Paying Top Dollar For The Lodge I Would Have Expected More Cooking Pans (With Lids To Match) Available On Arrive At Lodge  We Got Some More Via Housekeeping Who Had To Deliver Them In A Storm. And To Note  We Mentioned This To Reception...............The Dishwasher In Kitty Jay Does Not Work Properly. We Gave Up Reporting This As We Weren't On Holiday To Do An Inventory Or Maintenance Test On All Your Appliances. (Don't Think The Washing Cube Falls Out Of The Dispenser Till Just Before Cycle Finishes So Pans Only Getting Washed In Water),,,,,
,5169,I Have Marked Question 24 Above As Met.  In Most Respects Our Expectations Were Exceeded  However We Were Very Disappointed With Our Meal On The First Night,,,,,
,5175,No We Had A Lovely Time Thank You.,,,,,
,5176,No,,,,,
,5179,Improve Service In Restaurant - Eg. Not Have To Wait And Prompt To Get Drinks (Not Wine). Not Have The Wrong Meals Put In Front Of Us,,,,,
,5180,Turned The Heating Down...Had Enough Staff Rote Red To Manage Predictable Surge In Demand ..,,,,,
,5181,On Paying My Bill I Was Asked If We Would Like Assistance With Our Luggage I Accepted The Offer And Waited For 20 -25 Minutes When I Thought Actually I'll Get On And Do It Myself  Retrieve My Vehicle Carry Our Own Bags.One Small Oversight But A Little Disappointed That Once I'd Paid The Enthusiasm Seemed To Disappear.,,,,,
,5184,See Previous Notes. ,,,,,
,5185,No,,,,,
,5186,Be More Friendly And Less Up Tight,,,,,
,5191,Improve The Service At Breakfast. Also Ensure That The Breakfast Is Freshly Cooked. On The First Morning  The Fried Eggs And Bacon Had Clearly Been Cooked Some Time Previously  The Eggs Being Fairly Hard And The Bacon Greasy.,,,,,
,5193,All In All I Don't Think It Was Worth The Money. The Notion That You Would Even Apply A Discretionary Service Charge When The Cost Was So High Anyway Means I Couldn't Possibly Recommend You. In Fact  When People Ask About My Stay I Mention It. Even Though I Paid It  And Now Find It Was Discretionary. I Take It This Was To Cover Taking My Bags Out Of My Car And The Valet Parking  Two Things I Would Have Happily Done Myself  But Thought This Was The Service I Was Paying For.,,,,,
,5197,I Think If The Spa Prices Were Slightly Cheaper Or More In Line With Other Spa's I Would Have Had A Few But Felt Very Over Priced.,,,,,
,5202,We Found The Restaurant Service Was Variable  Some Staff Excellent  Others Fell Below Expectation. We Needed To Go To The Service Counter To Ask For Our Bill At Dinner  Tea  Coffee & Toast Were All Forgotten At Breakfast & Drinks Service Were Sometimes Slow.,,,,,
,5205,It Was Great To Use The Leisure Facilities After We'd Checked Out But The Changing Rooms Are Very Small With Little Privacy Especially When People Walk In Almost Straight From The Corridor. ,,,,,
,5207,No. ,,,,,
,5210,We Were Very Concerned With All The Reserved Labels On All The Empty Tables In The Piano Bar On The Saturday Evening. We Had To Have Our Drink Before Diner In The Corridor And When We Left 30 Minutes Later Most Of The Tables Were Still Empty. This Was The Same After We Ate But We Managed To Get A Table  But Many Other Guests Were Turned Away. Two Of These Reserved Tables Were Unoccupied For Over 90 Minutes And One Was Never Occupied. This Must Have Lost You Drink Sales And Made People Feel Unwanted.    ,,,,,
,5211,Refer To Previous Comments And My Discussion On The Phone Today With You.,,,,,
,5212,No,,,,,
,5213,One Minor Thing  At Breakfast Our Cooked Breakfast Was Brought To The Table Before We Had Finished Continental. ,,,,,
,5219,No,,,,,
,5220,It Was A Little Difficult To Find Somewhere To Relax Mid/Late Afternoon As Sofa Areas Carried Reserved Warnings  This Was For Afternoon Tea Bookings We Found  And Despite These Not Being For Some Time Later They Were Still Marked Reserved. ,,,,,
,5221,Food-Wise I Thought The Bread In The Restaurant And For Toast At Breakfast Could Have Been More 'Special'; Otherwise The Food  Particularly The Breakfast  Was Great.,,,,,
,5223,Improvement Of Food.,,,,,
,5227,Improvement On Food - Breakfast Was V Good Tho! ,,,,,
,5233,Recycling In Room For Paper And Bottles,,,,,
,5235,Not A Thing!,,,,,
,5236,Yes - Bring Back Or Replace The Magnificent Bull Picture In The Hall! More Importantly  We Found The Endless Sinatra-Type Music Playing In All The Lounges Really Irritating - Never Our Kind Of Music At The Best Of Times. We Would Prefer More Rooms To Be Music Free. We Retreated To Our Room On More Than One Occasion When We Would Have Preferred To Read Downstairs. ,,,,,
,5239,At Time Found That The Smoke Seemed To Be Blowing Into The Room A Little Much  Was  Noticeale When You Walked Pass The Room. I Think This Was Because It Was Breezy.,,,,,
,5240,Overall  I Found Many Of The Rooms (Including The Bedroom) Too Warm. ,,,,,
,5241,The Final Bill On Check Out Was Incorrect But Handeled Very Swiftly  Professionally And In A Friendly Manner. It May Be Easier To Check The Final Ill If The Items Were Detailed In Full.,,,,,
,5245,I Really Don't Think So. ,,,,,
,5246,Free And Instant Wi-Fi.,,,,,
,5249,Aside From The Bedrooms Needing A Little Tlc  Our Stay Was Delightful. ,,,,,
,5250,I Think That You Have Got Things Just Right. All The Little Touches  Wellies  Water And So Forth Add To The Feeling Of Being At Home. ,,,,,
,5252,Improve The Bistro Service And Helpfulness To Those Who Have To Be On A Gluten Free Diet.,,,,,
,5257,Improve The Weather. ,,,,,
,5259,Food Could Be Better But That's Down To Personal Taste As Well.,,,,,
,5260,No Perfect In Every Way  And Especially Enjoyed The Birds Of Prey Demonstration.,,,,,
,5266,Nothing,,,,,
,5270,I Don't Usually Like Hotel / Indoor Pools But I Enjoyed Swimming In The Pool. ,,,,,
,5279,Slightly Slow Service On Check Out Morning When We Stayed To Relax In Oak Room And Ordered Coffee. ,,,,,
,5280,The Service Charge Is Way Too Much And To Be Added To Everything Was The Only Tarnish To Our Stay,,,,,
,5281,It Was A Bit Confusing That We All Wanted To Pay Separately.  It Was Difficult For Us And For Your Staff  However  We Did Tell The Staff Which Rooms We Were In And Had The Impression That We Would Be Charged By Room.  The End Bill For Food And Bev Was A Bit All Over The Place And We Had To Reallocate All Costs.  It Was A Bit High Pressure At The Front Desk And It Would Have Been Better If The Front Desk Had Proposed A Solution Before I Did.
,,,,,
,5282,Change The Staff In The Dining Room. And Don't Call Your Discretionary Tipping Discretionary If You Are Going To Include It In The Bill. I Found This Distasteful. ,,,,,
,5289,Include The 12.5% In Your Overall Costings & Be Honest.
,,,,,
,5295,Keep Promises And My Overall Experience Would Have Been Better ,,,,,
,5297,Not Reserve Table In The Oak Bar  We Felt Very Awkward Being Told Two Different Table Were Reserved And Had To Leave The Bar.,,,,,
,5298,Let Us Know Beforehand What We Could Book,,,,,
,5303,We Can't Think Of Any Way That Our Short Time Could Have Been Improved.,,,,,
,5304,The Coffee In The Room Was A Faff To Make. We Stayed At A Hotel Recently In Dublin That Had Nespresso Machines In The Room. 

A Mini Bar Would Be Nice.,,,,,
,5305,Mobile Phone Reception Was Not Easily Available.,,,,,
,5306,Stop The Rain :),,,,,
,5316,I Wish We Had Arrived Ealier Because We Could Have Used The Facilities Before We Checked In And This Is Not Like Other Hotels. This Is One Of The Best Experiences In A Hotel We Have Ever Had And We Are Glad This Deal Came Up On Travelzoo Because We Would Never Have Considered The Hotel Due To The Room Prices And Meals. This Was An Excellent Deal But Even Ifthis Deal Does Not Come Up Again We Would Consider Staying For That Special Occasion.,,,,,
,5318,No,,,,,
,5319,Coat Hooks In Bathroom!!  And Perhaps Biscuits Without Coconut ( Being Very Pedantic) In The Tea Making Facilities,,,,,
,5322,- One Pants From A Green Uniform Who A Boy Was Wearing Had A Hole 
- At The End A More Efficient Arrangement Of The Bill Could Have Taken Place. We Were A Group And The Extras Mixed Up. The Stuff Was Helpful And Kind But Couldn't Short It Out Efficiently Or Suggest A Solution 
- I Like The Ideas Of Giving Boots  I Like The Falconry  The Room Was Nice And The Bed Good Too  The Personnel Was Kind And Discrete.
- Receptionists Did Their Best But Perhaps The Hotel Could Provide A Special Training For Them Or Continuous Trainings To Support The Overall Experience ,,,,,
,5323,Not Been Given A Room Not Directly Above The Members Party
Improve Food And Service In Castle Bistro
,,,,,
,5325,The Public Areas Of The Hotel Were A Little Too Warm!,,,,,
,5327,Out Of Peak Times - Such As Late Friday Afternoon And Sunday Evening There Were Few Staff In The Main Hall - On The Friday I Had To Find Someone To Get A Pot Of Tea - It Came (No Biscuits) And Then No Staff Came Back - I Again Went And Found Someone For A Refill Of Hot Water And Again We Sat In The Main Hall By The Fire And Saw No One - There Is Balance Between Over Bearing Service And None - The Balance Needs Attention. The Public Rooms Are Lovely - The Soft Furnhishing Are A Bit Tired But The Whole Area Is Lacking Something - Maybe Some Flowers Or Sented Candels - The Poinsettia's In The Room With The Parrot In Should Have Gone In The Bin In Early January !,,,,,
,5329,Nothing Stands Out  Overall Positive.,,,,,
,5334,Hotel Was Very Warm  I Know It's Difficult To Cater Needs Of All People But We Slept With The Window Open  Cooler Bedrooms / Changing Areas In Spa  May Have Been More Comfortable ,,,,,
,5336,In The Oak Bar For Afternoon Tea We Asked 2 Staff For Service Letting Them Know We Had Been Waiting Over 20 Mins - We Still Didn't Get Asked For Our Order So Eventually Left,,,,,
,5338,No,,,,,
,5342,Given Us A Free Night As An Extra - The Travel Home On Sunday Was Appalling (Flooding). :),,,,,
,5344,No.,,,,,
,5349,Having Been A Regular Guest  I Still Feel That You Have So Much To Offer At The Hotel Which Is Not Promoted.  How About A Book Of Things To Do In The Library  Instead Of All The Wedding Photo Books?  On Arrival In The Lodge The Handbook Is Lost  Again Maybe A Simple List Of What Is On Offer For That Week As Well As The Daily Sheet  Instead Of Having To Read Through The Handbook Of How To Work The Heating.  You Have So Many Great Staff And So Much To Offer.  ,,,,,
,5350,Nothing Immediately Springs To Mind,,,,,
,5351,No,,,,,
,5352,No,,,,,
,5355,We Wish We Could Say That There Was As There Shouldn't Be Anything That Is Absolutely Perfect  But Staying At Bovey Castle Was Absolutely Perfect.  Thank You All.,,,,,
,5356,No It Was Great,,,,,
,5358,Nothing Springs To Mind,,,,,
,5361,The Stay Was Outstanding In Every Way. ,,,,,
,5362,Only The Extractor Issue. ,,,,,
,5363,Redirect The Jet Stream!!!,,,,,
,5364,Shame We Missed The Falconry Display Due To Inclement Weather.  Not The Fault Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,5365,See Above Comments,,,,,
,5371,No The Staff Were Excellent.,,,,,
,5372,The Bill Was A Little Difficult Fathom Out And We Were Unaware The Service Charge Was Discretionary. We Would Of Paid It Anyway As Service Was Outstanding.,,,,,
,5373,Nothing. If One Does Not Like This Place One Had Better Stay At Home. I Came All The Way From Norway To Stay Here And I Am Glad I Did. I Will Be Back.,,,,,
,5382,No,,,,,
,5383,Make A Perfect Pizza.....Go To Harrods And Try Theirs!
,,,,,
,5385,Having Double Charged Us For Lunch Which I Noticed And It Was Corrected  A Few Days Later They Called Us To Querie If We Had Lunch On The Second Day Which We Had Not.

At Check Out Others Were Complaining Re Accurate Bills,,,,,
,5387,No.  Even Tho We Couldn't Play Golf Because Of The Awful Storms We Still Had A Lovely Time.,,,,,
,5388,The Room Could Have Been Better  Particularly The Bathroom.,,,,,
,5392,No,,,,,
,5396,I Think I Have Covered My Gripes    We Used To Feel Special At The Hotel ( Which Is Why It Was Chosen As Our Wedding Venue ) Now  This Is Not The Case Unfortunately. I Think The Constant Staff Changes May Have Something To Do With This.
,,,,,
,5397,Tv Had Very Limited Channels,,,,,
,5398,I Was Unaware Of The Service Charge Until I Got Home  I Thought That It Was A Bit On The High Side.  Did Not Know Or Was Not Told That It Was Discretionary,,,,,
,5399,No.  I Cannot Single Out Any One Person Or Situation Above Others As Everyone We Met Was Charming  Helpful And Friendly.  I Have Stayed In Many Hotels Where The Service Falls Down Due To Staff Who Appear Aloof And Unhelpful Or Where There Are Insufficient Staff To Deal With The Number Of Guests Staying.  This Was Not The Case At Bovey Castle ,,,,,
,5402,No Final Account Given So Unsure What Is Happening. It Should All Be Covered By Travelzoo. Had To Go And Get Key For Spa Locker And It Would Have Been Helpful For Staff To Offer To Get It . Had To Wait And Ask More Than Once For Coffee To Be Served.,,,,,
,5404,Our Expectation Was High Bearing In Mind The Price Range And Market That The Hotel Was Pitching For And It Was Met.
Access To Spa Booking Could Be Improved (No Callback From Spa Phone Number When Voice Mail Left).
,,,,,
,5405,No  It Was A Lovely Stay!,,,,,
,5406,Advertise When Falconry Was Not Happening. Twice We Arranged To Get The Children Out Of The Pool In Time For The Falconry Display Only To Find It Did Not Happen (Monday And Thursday During Our Stay). Also You May Well Want To Check Your First Aid Requirements At Reception... What Should Be In Any First Aid Box... ,,,,,
,5407,Overpriced For What We Had - When Spending In Excess Of £500 We Expected More Luxurious Accommodation Frankly Our Room Was A Bit Basic,,,,,
,5413,If You Could Control The Weather Then You Would Have The Perfect Package  But Having Said That The Warmth And Comfort Of The Rooms More Than Made Up For The Rain Which Kept Us Mostly Indoors On The Second Day Of Our Stay,,,,,
,5415,Bring The Luggage Up Quicker And The Turn Down A Little Earlier.,,,,,
,5416,Having Stayed Twice Previously  The Standard Was Set Very High. On This Occasion  We Had To Ask For Biscuits In The Room  Request Fresh Milk  And Also  When Asking To Refresh The Ice For Our Prosecco  This Was Not Done  And I Had To Ask A Second Time. Minor Minor Issues  Which Did Not Stop Us From Having An Enjoyable Experience But Just Slightly Below What We Are Used To. ,,,,,
,5417,Just Better Weather To Have Dried Out The Golf Course To Do 18 Holes.,,,,,
,5418,No Everthing Was Very Good,,,,,
,5420,Yes  Not Called Us Up After Booking Was Made To Sell Us More. And Removed Waiter In Edwardian From My Experience - You Would Have Scored Higher On Many Areas If That Had Been A Pleasant Evening. Also I Mentioned My Dissatisfaction To Reception On Departure  Why They Were Sympathetic They Did Nothing (And My Suspicion Is She May Not Have Fed It Upwards). Other Establishments Would Have Immediately Discounted My Meal Or Followed Up A Few Days Later With A Letter Of Apology And A Special Offer To Try And Retain My Custom.,,,,,
,5422,Sort The Damp Out And The Overall Conditions Of The Female Changing Rooms (To The Pool) As Well As Get A Pool Cleaner As The Pool Area Was Quite Messy And Dirty Towels Left Everywhere.,,,,,
,5423,We Did Find That Out Of Control Children In The Dining Area Annoying  More Especially When Parents Seemed To Ignore Them. We Realise Its Beyond Your Control And Just A Sign Of The Times!
 Maybe The Little Ones Should Have An Earlier Meal Time? 
,,,,,
,5424,We Probably Should Have Complained About The Room But Felt We Had Been Put There Because We Had Booked Through Travel Zoo,,,,,
,5427,The Turn Down Service Came To The Room As I Was Getting Ready Rather Than When We Were At Dinner.  I Would Trust Staff To Enter  Turn Down The Bed  Leave Fudge Etc Whilst I Was At Dinner And It Would Be A Pleasant Surprise When Returning To The Room.  Rather Than Answering The Door In A Dressing Gown!  (You Could Always Ask On Check In Whether A Guest Would Like To Decline The Turn Down Service?),,,,,
,5428,Please See Above,,,,,
,5429,A Little Bit Of Decoration Needed In Some Rooms Only. ,,,,,
,5430,Unless You Know How To Stop The Rain So My Husband Could Have Played Golf! Or Build An Out Door Swimming Pool For The Summer   ,,,,,
,5433,I Think It Would Be Really Tough To Come Up With Any Other Ideas.... We Very Much Enjoyed The Stay And I Can't Fault Anything. Even The Fact That It Was A Terrible Weather And Electrics Went Off Several Times Didn't Upset Us.,,,,,
,,,,,,,
30,Do You Have Any Further Comments?,,,,,,
,Total Responses:,2073,,,,,
,Not Answered:,0,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,
,1,Over Another Enjoyable Stay. Minor Point: The Break Down The Final Invoice Is Still Confusing  Separating Food And Beverage Like You Do. As A Guest I Remember The Final Amount Signed For Not The Proportion Of Food To Drink. Splitting As You Do Takes Longer To Go Through At Check Out.,,,,,
,4,My Husband And I Will Definately Be Back But You Do Need To Make Clear The Extra Charges That Will Be Incurred.,,,,,
,5,Improve The Selction Of The Bistro Menu.,,,,,
,7,Re The Account: If It Had Been Just One Family  In Just One Room  I'm Sure The Account Would Have Been Straight Forward. However  Due To The Make Up Of Our Party  The Accounts Were Confusing - But We Had Such A Great Time  We Don't Mind!!,,,,,
,9,Can't Wait To Visit Again,,,,,
,10,During Our Stay I Proposed To My Girlfriend So It Was A Particularly Special Time. Thank You To Everyone  We Look Forward To Coming Back Again In The Future.,,,,,
,11,I Have Already Noted Comments In The Survey  I Hope These Points Can Be Taken Into Consideration For Future Events And Seen As Constructive Feedback.,,,,,
,12,Overall We Had A Good Stay And Would Come Again. The Welcome Was Excellent  We Felt Very Much At Home And The Setting Is Stunning. However  Quite Simply The Level Of Service Is Far Too Slow For A Hotel Of This Price. We Did Not Get Too Wound Up By It As We Were In No Rush And It Was Our First Weekend Away With Our Son So The Fact That He Was So Well Looked After And The Staff So Kind (Notwithstanding Being Slow) Meant We Put Up With It And Did Not Want It To Spoil Our Stay. However  Being Totally Honest It Was Too Slow.,,,,,
,14,Great Location.  Very Pretty Place!,,,,,
,15,Two Areas Need Upgrading: The Gym Equipment Is Just Only Average. There Is Not Enough Seating Around The Pool And The Jacuzzi Is Poor (Not Warm Enough And Not Very Effective).  The Golf Is Excellent.  The Little Book Of Walks Was Excellent: We Did 4 Of The Walks  All Varied And Beautiful.,,,,,
,17,The Lack Of Mobile Access Will All Be A Negative For People That Are Reliant On Their Mobiles For Work,,,,,
,20,Please Do Not Change  It Is Hard To Improve On Perfection...,,,,,
,21,Could You Keep Us Informed About Your Christmas Activities. Thank You.,,,,,
,22,Hope To See You Later In 2012 When The Weather Warms Up,,,,,
,25,Some Of The Facilities In The Rooms Needed Upgrading  Especially In The Bathroom And The Sitting Area In The Room.,,,,,
,26,We Enjoyed Our Stay But Felt That It Did Not Constitute Good Value For Money.,,,,,
,27,Other Than That We Had A Fabulous Time And Will Definitely Be Returning In The Very Near Future.  I Might Even Have My Wedding There I Liked It So Much.  Thank You.,,,,,
,28,We Have Already Booked Our Return In December And All Of Us Are Looking Forward To Seeing The Hotel Dressed For Christmas.....It Could Be An Annual Thing Now. Please Don't Change Anything  All 6 Of Us Loved It (Ages 6 To 49) And Are Not Sure We Want To Tell Our New Found Secret Hotel To Anyone Else!!,,,,,
,29,It Was A Birthday Treat And We Couldn't Have Enjoyed It More.  Thank You.  We Liked The Service Charge As It Took Care Of Money Without Us Having To Worry About Tipping.  We Loved The Falconry Display And Grounds.  Every Detail Was Appreciated  The Fudge Was Delicious!,,,,,
,30,Excellent Would Come Again To Stay,,,,,
,31,Have And Will Continue To Recommend. Look Forward To Our Next Stay.,,,,,
,32,Discretionary' Service Charges Were Added Without Option.,,,,,
,33,Just To Say A Huge Thank You To All Staff For Making Our Stay So Wonderful. This Include The Activity Team Too  From Ian The Clay Shot Guy  Who Was Just Fantastic  To Martin And His Scary Big Bird!,,,,,
,34,It Was A Most Enjoyable Stay And All Of Intend To Return.  Many Thanks,,,,,
,36,General Wear And Tear In Hotel - Safety Issues On First Floor With Carpet Ruched Up. Dog Policy - My Husband Is Allergic To Dogs - We Were Surprised And He Was Not So Happy About The Amount Of Dogs At The Venue - Luckily For Him He Was Not At Reception When I Witnessed A Dog Defacating In Front Of It- I Blame The Owner Who Had Clearly Not Walked Him! However  A Reminder To Dog Owners Would Be Good To Ensure They Walk Their Dogs And Remember Other Guests May Not Be So Enamoured By Their Pets.,,,,,
,40,Nice  Overall Experience,,,,,
,41,An Excellent Break With Some Lucky Sunshine For The Duration Of Our Stay. Very Relaxing With Plenty To See And Do. A Massive Thank You To Federico And All Of The Staff.,,,,,
,43,Excellant Experience,,,,,
,44,We Would Like To Thank The General Manager For Giving Us The Chance To Return To Bovey For A Complimentary Stay. We Had A Bad Experience In September For Our Birthdays  We Stayed Three Nights. The Room Had Many Problems. We Do Feel Now We Will Happily Return  But Make Sure We Get The Correct Rooms. When Choosing Rooms On The Internet  You Cant See The Room Plans.,,,,,
,48,Lovely That All The Wellies And Coats By The Door.  We Used These A Couple Of Times.   Falcon Display Was Very Good. One Little Niggle - Our Breakfast Tray From Thursday Morning Was Still Sitting Outside Our Room When We Went To Bed Thursday Night! Not Nice To See Porridge Sitting There All That Time!.,,,,,
,49,A Super Stay Thank You,,,,,
,50,A Really Lovely Experience  Will Definitely Come Back,,,,,
,51,Bar Staff Very Attentive,,,,,
,52,Staff Are Exceptional - Even Compared To Four Seasons.,,,,,
,55,Breakfast Service Was Disappointing. On Both Occasions Tea/Coffee/Toast Took Far To Long To Arrive Post Order. We Had To Chase Up The Order On Both Mornings. Very Frustrating.  Breakfast When It Arrived However Was Excellent.,,,,,
,56,Great Hotel  Beautiful Surroundings. Staff Worked Very Hard To Please. Loved The Kids Activities And Falconry Display Was A Rwal Treat. Definitely Would Visit Again And Have Raved About The Hotel To Friends  The Only Negative Was The Slightly Chaotic Service. Get That Right And The Place Would Be Perfect.,,,,,
,61,We Will Recommend Your Hotel To Anyone Interested In A Wonderful  Relaxing Vacation.  Top Notch!,,,,,
,63,Archery And Air Guns Bit Expensive For What Is On Offer But Enjoyable All The Same.,,,,,
,64,No  As You Know  We Love Coming To Bovey Castle And Hope To Return Soon,,,,,
,66,We Were Made To Feel Welcome From All Members Of Staff And Had An Outstanding Weekend Stay And Would Lke Thank All Involved For An Outstanding Experience.,,,,,
,67,Please Put Our Name Down For Any Future Promotions.,,,,,
,68,A Huge Thank You To You And Your Team Federico.  Abbiamo Apprezzato Il Nostro Soggiorno!,,,,,
,69,Breakfast Was A Little Haphazard With Service On 2 Of Themornings,,,,,
,70,Would Like Written Confirmation Of Two/Three Days Break Dates Hopefully In Lodge So I Can Plan Dates  My Wife Works School Dates. I Have Requested Dates On The 1/8/2013,,,,,
,73,We Will Return - Without Doubt - But We Would Hope The Service Levels In The Restaurants Etc Would Be Better And The Menus Overhauled.  The Manager And Staff Have Created A Wonderfully  Relaxed Feeling Around The Hotel And It Did Feel As Though We Were Part Of A House Party - That Is Not An Easy Atmosphere To Create So Well Done To The Team. But  Considering The Prices  There Just Needs To Be A Little More Attention To Detail On The Small Things....Fittings In The Rooms A Bit Stained  Chaotic Food Service Etc Etc....But I Keep Saying It - We Will Be Back :-),,,,,
,75,We Had A Brilliant Weekend And I Would Love To Return With Family - Best Bits Were The Service  Public Rooms  Bar (Atmosphere And The Range Of Drinks And Cocktails On Offer)  Pool And Setting.  Price Is The Stumbling Block And I'd Need To Feel More Confident About The Food.  Bovey Has A Reputation In The Industry For Being A Bit 'Bling'  But After My Visit  I Don't Agree. I Have Been Writing About Hotels For 10 Years And It Was A Real Treat To Stay Somewhere That Wasn't Work Related!,,,,,
,77,Thank You  It Was Perfect For Us To Celebrate New Year In Style With Our Children - Made It Very Special And We Hope To Return To Bovey Very Soon!  Also  It Might Be Worth Offering The Ny's Eve Package To Include Ny's Day As I Would Have Preferred To Go Home On The 2Nd January  But Wasnt Give A Price To Include The 3Rd Night And Think This Would Have Been A Great Thing To Do If Not Too Expensive....?,,,,,
,78,Golf Course Was Excellent  Also Enjoyed Croquet & The Pool. Bird Displays Were Also Interesting.,,,,,
,79,Very Nice,,,,,
,85,Reception Staff Could Have Been A Little More Helpful.  Telephone Requests Were Answered But Face To Face Seemed To Be Forgotten.  Help With Luggage And With Room Telephone Were Overlooked. Housekeeping Very Good And Replenished Any Coffee Or Water In Our Room Instantly.  Very Much Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,
,87,Next Time We'll Try To Stay Longer So That We Get To Use More Of The Facilities And Enjoy More Activities,,,,,
,88,Wonderful Spacious Accommodation,,,,,
,89,Bring Your Prices Down A Bit   Do Some Deals And You'll Start To Fill The Place. It Looks And Feels Like What It Is. For Sale.,,,,,
,91,We Would Have Loved To Have Stayed Longer,,,,,
,93,I Was Slightly Annoyed That Nearly Every Item On The Bill Had A Service Charge Added - When There Was No Advance Notice Of Same (Not What It Says On The Tin Syndrome). However  The Total Service Charge Was Not Too Disproportionate To What I Would Have Added To The Bill.,,,,,
,96,Lovely Stay  Grounds Are Beautiful.  More Sizes Of Wellies Please.  Wish We Could Have Stayed Longer,,,,,
,98,In Respects To The Discretionary Service Charge This Was Already Added To Our Overall Bill On Checkout So I Felt Obliged To Pay It.,,,,,
,100,I Ask For The Rate Of A Room And Breakfast For Two Or Three Nights. I Was Quoted Â£259 Per Night. We Decided To Have One Night  And  Paid Â£259  This Was For A Classic  We Were Upgraded. I Looked On My Computer At Home After Our Stay To Find We Could Have Had Three Nights For Â£450 ?,,,,,
,102,It Seemed Strange That When The Bill Inaccurately Charged Us For Breakfast  I Had To Prove That We Should Not Be Charged By Producing The Reservation Booking. I Was Told That Your System Did Not Record That We Have Breakfast Included In Our Package. It Was A Shame That I Had To Provide The Evidence But I Must State That Once I Did It Was Not Queried For A Moment.,,,,,
,104,Thank You For A Wonderful Stay. We Were Really Impressed By The Hotel  The Service And The Quality Of The Restaurant.,,,,,
,107,I Felt That The Entire Experience Of Coming And Staying With You  Extremely Nice  Comfortable And Relaxing.  I Had Previously Visited The Castle  To Play Golf  But Never Stayed With You.  I Would Certainly Like To Do So Again And Would Certainly Recommend The Experience To Others.  Thank You Very Much.,,,,,
,108,Generally Our Stay Was Great! We Enjoyed The Hotel And The Staff Were Very Friendly  However As I Have Mentioned The Restaurant Fell Well Short Of The Level Achieved By The Rest Of The Hotel. We Would Come Back To The Hotel And Would Recommend It  But I Would Ensure We Made Arrangements To Eat Our Evening Meal Out Of The Hotel. With A Bit Stronger Management And Team Leading I Think Bovey Castle Could Be Superb.,,,,,
,109,Look Forward To A Future Visit.,,,,,
,111,See Above,,,,,
,118,The Bovey Castle Website Is Not Very User Friendly And Therefore Does Not Do The Hotel Justice.,,,,,
,119,I Think Charging For Internet Use Is Unacceptable ! The Room Rate You Charge Surely Dose Not Warrant This Additional Charge ?,,,,,
,122,Can't Wait To Come Out Again Soon!!,,,,,
,124,We Felt That The Late Summer Madness Offer Was A Little Misleading Reading 2 Nights  For 279.00.As We Had To Book Very Last Minute And Were Very Busy Prior To Our Departure We Had Not Realised It Was Per Person   Although Remember Speaking To Your Receptionist On Thr Telephone That That Was The Complete Price For Two Nights Lfelt Confident And Clear That L Had Clarified The Tariff  We Had A Lovely Weekend But It Was Rather Disconcerting When Presented With The Bill.We Always Are Very Happy To Tip But Did Feel That The Service Charges Were Quite Heavy Over All We Know That They Are Not Compulsary But Being Presented With A Rather Heavier Bill Than Anticipated We Only Realisedwhat We Had Paid On Arriving Home.,,,,,
,130,Perhaps Selling Some Provisions Would Help Occupants Of The Lodges Who Self-Cater,,,,,
,139,I Did Not Include The Discretionary Charge At The End Of Yor Stay Because Of Having To Go To The Bar And Ask For Another Drink When My Glass Was Empty. This Despite Siting Immediately In Front Of The Bar. Both Staff Were Not Paying Attention To The Small Number Of Guests That Were In The Bar Area.,,,,,
,142,Hope We'll Be Able To Stay Again And Use The Golf Course And Other Facilities. Thank You.,,,,,
,143,Our Only Small Issue Was On A Couple Of Occasions The Service Was A Little Slow! We Waited For Our First Drink In The Bar Shortly After We Arrived For A While As There Was Nobody There. And In The Bistro After Being Told To Take A Seat Outside We Waited Around 15 Minutes For Even A Drinks Order!,,,,,
,148,We Ordered Lego A Couple Of Times From Reception And The Children Were Very Pleased With Their Toys. However  There Were To Occasions When We Ordered Lego And It Did Not Arrive Even After Chasing It Up. As You Can Imagine We Had Two Disappointed Children Which Wasn't What We Had Expected. Please Ensure This Is Followed Up As It Was One Of The Selling Points For Us When We Booked A Week At Bovey Castle As We Have Young Children. We Would Also Like To Say That The Hotel Made Our Children Very Welcome. The Bistro Film Nights And Bovey Rangers Were Big Hits With The Children And The Food In The Hotel Was Excellent  Thank You.,,,,,
,152,Your Hotel Is Wonderful In Nearly Every Way  So Many Things To Do But Its Very Odd That If You Had Dog You Couldnt Walk Round The Golf Course With Him While Playing Golf. It Means A Extra Dog Walk After A 3 Hour Course Walk ( Not Much Of A Break ) . Loved The Hotel...Have You Thought Of Offering A Dog Walking Service ?,,,,,
,153,Felt The Decor In The Rooms Could Be Doing With A Freshen Up - Our Tv Was Also A  Bit Temperamental But We Didn't Go To Watch Tv  The Location Was Beautiful - Overall We Had A Lovely Time.,,,,,
,155,A Renovation Would Do Some Good For The Hotel. The Whole House Is Beautiful But A Bit Decayed. That Is The Reason Why We Were A Bit Disappointed When We Arrived. The Surrounding On The Other Hand Is Perfect!,,,,,
,156,Really Enjoyed Ourselves And Will Definitely Return Again.,,,,,
,157,The Comments Made Are From A Career In Customer Service And Are Things That Should Not Happen In A Hotel Of This Statue. Little Things I Know But Sometimes Its The Little Things That Can Let It Down. Overall The Staff Where Excellent And The Hotel Was Amazing.,,,,,
,160,The Grounds Were Fabulous  Very Well Cared For And Maintained  A Real Pleasure To Walk Around And Feel Part Of  Very Restful And Peaceful  Lovely Seating Areas  Boules Was Enjoyable  Croquet Great Fun  The Reflecting Ponds Unforgettable  The Gentleman Giving The Falconry Displays Was A Wonderful Character  Charming And Knowledgeable  Having Afternoon Tea In The Adam Room Was Wonderful  Sitting On The Large Comfy Sofa In Front Of The Windows  We Loved All The Seating Areas Throughout And The Discreet Way They Were Arranged Allowing Quiet Being  The Peaceful Walks Along The River Were Refreshing Then Finding Two Deck Chairs On The South Terrace To Sit In The Sun Was The Perfect End To An Afternoon.,,,,,
,161,Very Comfortable  Well Equipped Lodge,,,,,
,163,We Enjoyed Meeting Archimedes  Merlin And The Others!,,,,,
,167,Looking Forward To Coming Back!,,,,,
,170,Really Enjoyed The Weekend  I Wouldn't Want To Give Any Other Impression  We Would Definitely Recommend But Our Stay Would Have Been Improved With A Better Room Service Menu And That Little Bit Of Extra Care In Responding To Issues. So Very Nearly A 5 Star Weeken.,,,,,
,172,All Of Our Party Left Slightly Disappointed And Rather Underwhelmed That A Special Location Did Not Quite Meet Our Expectations,,,,,
,173,We Were Extremely Please To Be Able To Bring Our Little Dog To The Hotel  Who Throughly Enjoyed Going To Sleep In Front Of The Fire In The Library And Was Most Welcomed By Your Staff.  But Once Again I Was Disappointed To Find Whilst Walking Our Dog That A Number Of People Do Not Pick Up After Their Dog  Perhaps A Big Hint To Everyone When They Stay By Giving Them Some Poo Bags When They Arrive  Once Gain The Fact That These Owners Are Not Respecting The Fact They Are Allowed To Walk Their Dogs In Such Stunning Grounds Is A Mystery To Me,,,,,
,178,Don't Like The Discretionary (Which Doesn't Feel Particularly Discretionary) Service Charge,,,,,
,180,If You Are Able  Figure Out How To Have Better Cellphone Reception In/At The Hotel.  People Rely On Cellphone Communication Nowadays  And The Weak And Erratic Signal Is Very Frustrating.,,,,,
,181,Didn't Like The Fact That A Service Charge Was Added Automatically For Each Order.,,,,,
,182,We Enjoyed Our Stay   But This Was A 'Travelzoo' Deal  Had We Paid The Full Price I Don't Think We Would Have Been Satisfied.,,,,,
,183,As Above!  Also To Make Matters Worse We Were Booked Down For A Cooked Breakfast  Not The Continental We Had Eaten!!!  This Took Quite A While To Clarify!,,,,,
,185,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Visit And One That We Hope To Repeat. Thank You.,,,,,
,186,We Found The Grounds Exceptionally Well Cared For And Were A Joy To Use.   The Falconary Display Was A Really Wonderful Surprise And Experience.   The Facility For Dogs Around The Grounds Is A Really Good Idea But One Or Two More Collection Bins Would Be Appreciated.,,,,,
,189,You Have A Good Formula And Great Staff Which Makes A Very Pleasant Experience Overall.,,,,,
,191,Outstandingly Pleasant And Comfortable Day Thanks,,,,,
,193,Overall A Most Pleasurable Stay.  We Very Much Hope To Return Soon!,,,,,
,195,My Husband Was Very Disappointed That In The Three Rooms We Viewed A Coffee Table Book Entitled 'Afgan Faces' Was Present.  He Did Not Feel This Was An Appropriate Book To Be Featured.,,,,,
,200,We Love Bovey Castle And Hope To Come Back Some Time Soon. The Atmosphere Is Great And The Staff Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,201,It Was Great To See You All - Hope To Be Back Soon!,,,,,
,205,We Had A Reeeaally Relaxing Few Days We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome And Very Much Enjoyed The Ambiance And People That We Met At Bovey I Have Already Reccommended You To Lots Of People Who Would Also Like To Have A Special Treat!!!,,,,,
,206,Thank You For Our Stay.,,,,,
,207,We Had A Lovely Family Celebration  With The Private Dining It Was Lovely To Be Able To Mingle Freely With Family Members And Not Disturb Other Guests. It Was Fantastic  Thank You To All The Staff.,,,,,
,208,We Are Very Dissappointed By Having No Feedback From Your Receptionist About The Above After An Enquiry Via Telephone On Our Return Home.,,,,,
,213,Staff Excellent And Freindly. The Room Really Let Us Down And Did Spoil It For Us Somewhat.,,,,,
,218,More Afordable Family Deals Would Encourage Me To Return As A Private Guest Over And Over Again.,,,,,
,222,It Is The Personal Touches Which Can Make Return Trips So Special. Remembering Names And Reasons For Visits; Perhaps Personalising Menus With Names And The Reason For Coming To Bovey Castle (Anniversaries/Birthdays For Example).,,,,,
,225,Special Thanks To Federico For Organising A Free-Lancer To Come In On Sunday Morning For My Wife And I To Enjoy The Spa.,,,,,
,228,Afternoon Tea Was Included. Everything Was Delicious Except The Scones.... Which Seemed Quite Hard/Stale. We Did Not Complain As The Tea Was Included In Our Package But I Would Not Have Been Happy If We Had Paid Â£38 For This! Setting Presentation Etc Was Lovely. Superb Falconry Display. Helpful Staff. Useful Internet/ Computers Available For Guests. Thank You For A Lovely Stay.,,,,,
,233,We Were Fortunate Enough To Be Able To Stay At Bovey Castle Due To An Offer Via Another Agency (Travelzoo) Had It Not Been For That The Stay Would Have Been Out Of Our Price Range. We Were Both So Pleased To Have Had The Experience And If Possible We Would Definately Return In The Future.,,,,,
,238,Before Booking  I Asked A Member Of The Resort Team What The Surrounding Area Was Like For Cycling. She Felt That We Would Need To Drive A Short Distance As The Roads Nearby Were Rather Windy.  We Discovered On Arrival That Bovey Castle Is Situated In A Popular Road Cycling Route And Is Way Marked For Cyclists So This Should Be Another Marketing Angle For Bovey Castle. Particularly As Road Cycling Is Increasing In Popularity.  As Active People We Enjoyed Running And Cycling In A Challenging Hilly Location.  The Superb Pool And Small But Extremely Well Equipped Gym Complemented This Perfectly. All Together Our Stay Was Faultless  The Staff Were Delightful. We Would Like To Move In!,,,,,
,239,The Discretionary Service Charge Is Not Something We Agree With.  It Was Added On To All Bills Automatically And Then We Would Have To Ask For It To Be Removed Which We Felt Uncomfortable About.  We Would Prefer To Either Tip For Exceptional Service Or Pay A Fixed Price For Every Item.  The Approach We Have Seen Elsewhere Is A Total Bill And Then We Had The Option To Add A Fixed Percentage If We Felt It Appropriate.  We Would Like To Know How The Service Charge On The Final Bill Is Applied As Each Element Of That Bill (Excluding Room) Has Service Charge Applied Already? Were We Charged Twice?,,,,,
,242,Your Staff Were All Lovely  Friendly  Polite But Not Stuffy. However Felt There Wasn't Any Joined-Up Organization - For Example Changing A Reservation Time For The Restaurant At Reception Didn't Get Passed On To The Restaurant  Twice! And Trying To Book Treatments Or Activities At Reception Or Asking Advice Always Had To Be Passed On To Someone Else.,,,,,
,244,Loved The Grounds And The Bird Display.,,,,,
,246,The Gym Was A Bit Small And Service Charges On Everything A Bit Of A Surprise,,,,,
,249,Shame About The Ripped Wall Paper In The General Bathroom In The Lodge But This Is A  Very Minor Thing Afternoon Tea Was Wonderful And The Welcome Pack Was Great It Would Be Great If You Did 3 Nights For Â£999 Again As We Would Definately Be Able To Afford This And Come Again!! Many Thanks Bovey Castle!!!,,,,,
,250,Keep Up The Good Work - Standards Are Hard To Maintain!,,,,,
,255,Hope We Acquire Some More Vouchers  Would Love To Be Able To Come Back Some Time. Was A Memorable Experience. It Was A Lovely Treat For Me And The Hubby To Take Time Out And Relax. Thank You.,,,,,
,258,The Staff Wre Not As Professional As Last Year. A Lack Of Understanding Does Not Help Especially When Ordering Food In The Grill.,,,,,
,259,Firework Display Was Amazing And A Perfect End To Nye,,,,,
,263,We Love Coming To Stay At Bovey Castle:)  Thank You!,,,,,
,264,Particularly Grateful For The Afternoon Tea Offered On The Last Day.  A Lovely Touch. Thank You To You All For Making This A Very Special Celebration Of 3 25Th Wedding Anniversaries!!,,,,,
,265,Lovely Hotel That We Have Wanted To Visit For A While  Will Definately Be Recommending.,,,,,
,266,None,,,,,
,270,Had A Lovely Walk By The River,,,,,
,273,Enjoyable Treat,,,,,
,274,I Was Surprised And Annoyed When My Room Had Been Serviced For The Next Visitors Before I Had Handed In My Key.  I Said My Case Was Ready For Collection When I Went Down For Breakfast But Was Going To Return Afterwards For A Last Check That I Had Not Forgotten Anything And To Pick Up My Coat But When I Went To The Room The Cleaning Lady Was Just Coming Out Having Prepared The Room For The Next Guest.  I Did Complain When I Returned My Key To The Desk But Again Not What You Expect From A 5 Star Or Any Other Hotel.,,,,,
,275,We Had A Very Pleasant Stay Last Week With The Staff Making Our Stay Very Enjoyable. Well Done To Them!!  Many Thanks To Them All.,,,,,
,277,I Had To Cancel My Breakfast On The Second Day As It Took Over A Hour And Still Didn't Turn Up...But Very Minor Thing Really.,,,,,
,278,The Stay Was Relaxing  Staff Very Polite And Helpful. The Food In The Restaurant Was Lovely. The Room And Bistro Were The Two Things We Thought Could Be Improved. Overall We Enjoyed The Break. Thank You,,,,,
,279,Falconry Display Was A Lovely Touch And Very Interesting.,,,,,
,280,Sticking A Service Charge On Everything Is An Absolute Cheek. You Put Clients In The Awkward Position Of Asking For It To Be Removed If They Do Not Agree With It - If I Want To Tip  I Do So For A Good Service Not As A Matter Of Course (Restuarants Perhaps Excluded) And The Service Hear Was Not That Great. The Grounds  Spa  Swimming Pool  Room  Cleanliness And General Feeling Of The Place Is Fantastic  Let Down Slightly By All The Other Elements.,,,,,
,281,Sorry But I Have To Say In The Steam Room The Odour Of Sweat Was Really Unpleasant.  A Little Eucalyptus Oil Would Go A Long Way.,,,,,
,282,Turn The Radio Down Where The Parrot Was. Not Everyone Wants To Have Noise Around Them.,,,,,
,283,My Only Point Is The Service Charge  I Read The Leaflet In The Customer Book In Our Room. This Stated The Servic Charge Paid For The Staff Christmas Party  Bonus Etc. Also A Charitable Was Given From This  If I Felt A Member Of Staff Gave An Excellent Service Then I Would Like To Of Had The Choice  May Be Then The Department Could Then Distribute This To Staff. Surely Then You Coud See Were Customers Were Happy Witht The Service. This Made Me Feel Very Reluctant To Stay Here Again. This Policy Was Not Mentioned On Booking I Only Found This Out By Reviewing Trip Advisor.,,,,,
,285,A Lovely And Relaxing Place,,,,,
,287,Dear Federico Thank You For Making Our Stay So Welcoming. You Have Really Tried To Smooth Over The Previous Difficulties We Had At Christmas  Which We Appreciate. We Really Enjoyed Our Weekend. Kind Regards Jacki Kynaston,,,,,
,290,I Think If The Dining Could Be Sorted Out And Improved It Would Really Raise The Standard Of Bovey Castle And Then Guests Would Not Need To Eat Out Elsewhere - As They All Do. Ther Needs To Be A Bit More Atmosphere In The Restaurant Soa Big Re-Think Is Needed. Otherwise I Love Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,291,Wonderful Place Without Pretension,,,,,
,292,Absolutely Loved Our Evening Away To Celebrate Our 25Th Wedding Anniversary - Just Wish We Could Afford To Do It Every Month!,,,,,
,295,Very Enjoyable - Hope To Return  Maybe One The 'Special' Weekday Or Weekends To Save On The Cost Somewhat.,,,,,
,299,I Cannot Exaggerate How Extraodinary Your Staff Are.  To A Man And Woman They Were Friendly Without Being Over-Familiar  Helpful And Happy.  Bovey Castle Is An Amazing And Beautful Place Made Even Better By The Wonderful People You Employ.,,,,,
,301,I Hope That We Can Do Business Together In The Future,,,,,
,302, Other Than That We Had A Great Stay  Many Thanks.,,,,,
,303,The Service Charge Policy In Terms Of How Money Will Be Allocated Etc Is Admirable. Would Have Welcomed A Little More Transparency At The Outset About What Would Attract A Service Charge (E.G. Pre-Booked Accommodation Package). Overall Though The Service Was Of A Good Standard.,,,,,
,304,Lovely Hotel. Struggled With A Large Function And To Service Guests. Several Guests  Us Included Trying To Find Where Swimming Pool  Spa  Gym Etc.  Was. Would Benefit From Supplying Guests With A Plan Of Hotel And Grounds. Great Place But Not Sure Everyone Gets The Best Out Of It As Not Sure What's On Offer And Where.,,,,,
,306,We Very Much Enjoyed The Grounds And The Location Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,308,We'd Liked To Have Stayed Longer!!!,,,,,
,309,Will Return Again Next Year  Might Even Get A Room At The Back With A Nice View - 3Rd Time Lucky!,,,,,
,311,One More Thing- Afternoon Tea  I Would Suggest That The Tea All Comes Out Together As Soon As The Order Is Taken And Then The Scones Come Out A Little After. People Don't Mind Waiting For Scones As Long As They Have A Cup Of Tea In Their Hand!,,,,,
,317,We Will Absolutely Be Returning For Another Stay Very Soon !,,,,,
,318,Keep Up The Good Work !,,,,,
,319,We Really Enjoyed Staying In The Lodge And Thought The Location Was Beautiful And Apart From The Exterior Problems And Some Of The Food Experiences We Hopefully Will Return. We Are Pointing This Out As Hopefully This Is Something That Can Be Rectified In The Future. We Thought The Staff Were Excellent And Very Friendly From The Moment We Arrived.,,,,,
,320,We Enjoyed Our Time At Bovey Castle And Hopefully We Will Return - We Are Mentioning Our Food Experiences And The Exterior Of The Lodge In The Hope That This Is Looked At And Rectified For The Future.,,,,,
,326,I Have Sent Reception An Email Regarding Some Items That We May Have Left In The Lodge  But Have Not Received A Reply Yet.,,,,,
,327,We Very Much Enjoyed Our Stay And Cant Wait To Book In Again For A Longer Stay Next Time - Too Much To Do In Just 1 Night!,,,,,
,331,Because This Was The First Break With Our Baby My Expectations Were High As You Were Highly Recommended.  I Was A Little Disappointed With Our Room And Especially The Cot That Was Provided And As We Had To Spend A Lot Of Time In The Room Because Our Baby Was Unwell It Somewhat Spoiled Our Time With You.,,,,,
,333,We Had A Lovely Time And The Hotel Is Beautiful  We Were Impressed With The Facilities And I Don't Want You To Think I Am Being Negative But For A Special Occasion I Was A Little Disappointed.,,,,,
,340,Thought The Overall Stay Was A Nice Experience. Pity The Weather Was So Awful.,,,,,
,342,The Atmosphere And The Surroudnings Are Simply Lovely. I Actuall Also Like The Service Charge Which Is Fair To All Staff And Avoids The Issues Around Tipping Services,,,,,
,343,I'm Pleased You Follow Up The Stay With This Feedback Questionnaire - I Hope My Comments Are Of Some Assistance.,,,,,
,345,Our Only Other Comments Are We Had Breakfast In Our Room On The First Morning We Stayed With You And We Had Ordered Two Full English And When It Arrived One Plate Had The Full Breakfast But The Other One Just Had Two Rashers Of Bacon On It. There Were No Cups To Drink Our Tea And No Butter For The Toast  Which Was A Shame Because We Felt That Kind Of Let The Hotel Down A Little Bit,,,,,
,346,I Think For A Venue For A One Day Conference But I Would Be Unwilling To Recommend A Stay-Over.,,,,,
,351,Grounds Are Stunning  Lovely Walks And Enjoyed The Games. Loved The Use Of Boots And Jackets.  ,,,,,
,356,The Falconry Display Each Morning Was Excellent,,,,,
,358,We Enjoyed Our Stay Very Much.,,,,,
,361,I Think We Told You Most Of This Last Night Fedo. We Had A Nice Time And Will Be Using The Restaurants More Now That You Have Mark There. It Will Be Wonderful If He Can Bring The Bistro Up To Standard Too  As Has Been Done In The Edwardian.,,,,,
,362,We Enjoyed The Falconry Display And Then Had A Walk In The Grounds Which Was Very Pleasant.,,,,,
,365,Some Staff Are Not As Customer Centric As Others. Some Communal Areas Are A Bit Dusty And Neglected.,,,,,
,366,It Would Be Good To Be Able To Prebook Or Be Told That We Could Prebook The Baby Listening Service. The Lego Service Wasn't Explained On Arrival As We Expected.,,,,,
,370,Thank You For Another Lovely Stay At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,374,The Castle Estate And Grounds Are Fantastic And The Lodge Was Well Set Out.  We Had A Lovely Stay There Despite The Less Than Summery Weather.,,,,,
,377,If There Is A Private Party Or Areas Of The Hotel Are Going To Be Off Limits To Hotel Guests This Should Be Advertised Or Advising On Arrival - We Were Well Looked After But We Would Have Maybe Arranged Our Dining / Evening Around This.,,,,,
,378,We Adored Our First Stay At Bovey Castle But Terribly Let Down On Our Last Stay,,,,,
,385,The Only System At The Lodges That Doesn't Work Is Refuse Collection(This Was A Problem Last Year Too). Housekeeping Does Not Arrive When Requested. On One Occasion  The Rubbish Was Left Overnight And Animals Got To It  Which Meant We Awoke To Food And Nappies All Over Our Front Deck! Unacceptable! It Took Two Phone Calls And A Visit To Reception Before It Was Removed. Even After Removal  We Still Needed To Clean The Deck. This Also Happened Twice At Jaystone Which Meant There Was Rubbish Spread Over The Path On A Number Of Days. As Stated  This Is The Only System That Doesn't Work;We Have No Other Complaints But This Issue Stands Out Because It Is In Such Stark Contrast To How Clean And Efficient The Rest Of Bovey Castle Is.,,,,,
,386,We Have Had Friends That Have Eaten At The Bistro A Few Times  As Indeed We Have  And Have Had Very Disappointing Meals. With Slow Service. Which Is A Shame As It Has A Lovely Atmosphere And Could Be So Good. Staff Lacked A Bit Of Finesse There And During The Day Were Quite Loud When Setting Tables Etc. It Just Spoiled The Atmosphere A Bit When You Walked Past To The Swimming Pool Etc. And Put You Off Going In. Please Take This As Constructive Criticism As We Love Coming To Bovey But Just Feel These Areas Let It Down Slightly. The Bird Display Even Though It Had To Be Indoors Due To The Weather Was Excellent.,,,,,
,387,I Like The Friendliness To Children.,,,,,
,388,We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Tranquility  The Secludedness Of The Cottage And The Entire Property. We Look Forward To Visit Once Again In The Near Future.,,,,,
,389,The Place And Our Stay Was Amazing - Definitely The Best Hotel We've Ever Been To,,,,,
,391,We Felt That The Grounds Could Have Been A Little Better Kept -We Noticed A Lot Of Rubbish Laying Around Near The Car Park.,,,,,
,393,Will Try And Come Again.,,,,,
,395,We Came To Stay Because We'd Heard It Was 'Dog Friendly' And It Really Is.  We Will Come Back For That Reason And Because It's Also A 'Human Friendly' Place In A Great Location.,,,,,
,397,We Will Come Back Again And May May It A Regular Break For Ourselves.,,,,,
,398,None,,,,,
,401,I Thought The Falconry Display After Breakfast Was Excellent.  For Some Reason I Had A Beauty Treatment Booked On My Check-In Sheet For The Day Following My Departure!,,,,,
,403,The Range Of Activities Were Great  Expecially For Kids. You Have A Truly Child Friendly Hotel. Particularly Enjoyed The Falconry Display - And Beaky Is A Star In His Own Right!,,,,,
,405,The Location And Ambience Of This Hotel Is Fabulous,,,,,
,406,Really Like The Falconry Display.,,,,,
,407,11 Am Breakfast Is Very Civilised Thank You. Turndown Service Was Very Comprehensive And Reflected The Standard Expected. Blackout Blinds Are Good To Have  We Had An Excellent Night's Sleep.,,,,,
,408,We Do Like Bovey Castle  I Am Pretty Sure We Will Be Back. The Staff Are Excellent  And That Also Applies To The General Manager Who For Me Leads By Example In Customer Service - Those Small Touches Make A Real Difference.,,,,,
,409,Bar Service Was Very Poor And Drinks Were Ordered That Did Not Arrive.Dress Code In The Bar And The Edwardian Grill Should Ban Denim Jeans And Trainers And Should Require Smart Casual At All Times,,,,,
,411,We Made Enquiries Prior To Our Visit Regarding The Hotel's Facilities  Ie Tennis  Badminton  Etc.  We Were Informed That Tennis Equipment Was Available To Borrow  However  These Ended Up Being Two Children's Rackets Which Were Not Suitable.  We Were Told No Badminton Equipment Was Available And So We Brought Our Own  However  On Enquiring About The Court We Were Advised That The Net Could Be Put Up Specially  But There Were No Court Markings.  We Asked About The Table Tennis And Had To Move The Table To A Suitable Place In The Room So We Were Able To Play.  The Directions For The Walk To The Pub Were Impossible To Follow And We Were Lost Several Times Despite Asking Staff For Directions  They Didn't Seem To Know.  We Were Unable To Pick Up Any Mobile Phone Signal Which We Felt Should Have Been Advised On Booking As Communication With Family At Home Was Imperative And Made Things Very Difficult.,,,,,
,412,I Did Not Aware Of The Daily Newspaper Was Not Complimentary Copy.,,,,,
,413,Really Lovely Stay And The Perfect Place For A Christmas Stay For My Family I Think.,,,,,
,414,All In All The Experience Was Very Good And The Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful. Our Total Bill Came To Almost Exactly Â£1000 Per Night Which Is Quite Steep  So I Do Think We Would Go For As Long Next Time.,,,,,
,415,See Earlier Comments On Staff And Bistro. Ambiance Of Hotel And Decor Was Perfect And So I Would Indeed Recommend It To Tohers Wholeheartedly,,,,,
,416,The Wine List Offered Our Choice Of Wine But Was Not Available To Drink.,,,,,
,418,The Golf Course Is Lacking Some Simple Tlc - Tee Markers /Signage And General Tidying Up - If Left Will Need A Lot Of Work To Restore,,,,,
,420,Emphasis Came Off The Regular Guests As Soon As Large Corporate Golfing Group Arrived For The Day,,,,,
,423,The Falconry Display In The Corridor Of The Hotel Was The Highlight Of Our Stay.  Interesting  Done With Humour And Care.  Guests Were Even Told Where They Could Stand To Get The Best Photographs. What More Could We Ask.,,,,,
,424,None  Other Than Thank You For Looking After Us So Well.,,,,,
,425,We Really Enjoyed Our Stay And Will Definately Come Back.  However  We Did Find The Breakfast A Bit Of A Shambles And Not Very Well Organised.   My Food Went Cold Because I Had To Wait For The Scrambled Egg And The Tables Werent Ready When We Got There.  My Partner Was Told 'You Cant Sit There'  And Then Someone Else Told It Was Fine To Sit There.  Several Of The Breakfast Staff Seemed A Bit Harassed And I Didnt Find It A Very Calm Experience.  Apart From That Our Stay Was Perfect In Every Way.,,,,,
,426,I Was Very Upset On Getting A Phone Call From Reception Asking Why We Had Not Paid Our Bill   We Had Booked Another Night And They Did Not Check This Before Accusing Us Of Leaving Before Paying. We Have Stayed At Many Luxury Hotels Villas Around The World And I Have Never Been Insulted Like That.,,,,,
,427,We Enjoyed Very Much Our Stay And We Were Able To Relax In A Delicate And Warm Atmosphere. I Hope To Come Back.,,,,,
,428,The Oustside Of The Lodges Are Very Badly Needing Attention - Paintwork!!,,,,,
,431,Not Five Star Service,,,,,
,433,A Stunning Location And A Wonderful Relaxing Romantic Hideaway But Disapointed With Our Room And Initial Embarrasement Of Being Showm Into Another Guests Room .,,,,,
,434,During Our Stay The Weather Was Not Hot - We Could Imagine Our Room Could Have Benefited From A Better Cooling System During Hotter Weather.,,,,,
,435,From A Purely Design Perspective We Both Felt That The Hanging Division Partitions In The Dining Room Detracted From The Overall Design Of The Room.Another Type Of Design For Example Folding Partitions/Removable Screens Of Several Meters High Would Still Allow Areas To Be Enclosed/Shut Off When The Restaurant Is Less Busy  But Would Not Detract From The Height Spaciousness And Design Of The Room.,,,,,
,436,I Declined To Pay The Service Charge Because We Were So Dissatisfied With The Bar Service And When The Bill Was Rewritten The Receptionist Omitted A Charge.  I Was More Than A Little Annoyed To Receive A Letter Informing Me That You Had Debited The Amount From Our Card Rather Than Having The Courtesy To Speak To Us First - Particularly As It Was Your Mistake And Given The Complaints We Had Made!,,,,,
,440,Really Enjoyed The Falconry Display,,,,,
,442,The Discretionary Service Charge Added To The Bill  Although I Know Is Discretionary Many People Do Not Wish To Be Embarrassed In Asking This To Be Removed. I Would Prefer If This Was Included In The Headline Price. I Note In Your Explanation For This Staff Can Elect To Donate To Charity. I Am Intending To Donate A Sum Of Money To Acer  A Cancer Charity We Support.,,,,,
,443,The Library External Door Would Benefit From Draught Excluders  Although The Weather Was Particularly Bad During Our Stay  So The Draught Was Somewhat Magnified. The Cathedral Lounge: I Appreciate The Problem Of Flue Draughting Is Being Addressed  But Even So To Heat That Large Area Must Be A Challenge In The Winter Months: It Was Certainly Chilly During Our Stay.,,,,,
,445,Until I Read Q 26 I Had Not Realised That The Service Charge Was Discretionary. We Paid A Gratuity At Dinner At The Time And Were Billed Again On The Main Bill ( I Had Not Noticed This On Checkout).Despite This We Are Very Happy With Our Stay But Perhaps Guests Should Be Aware Of Discretionary Gratuities.,,,,,
,446,Pity Mobile Reception Is Not Good As We Personally Need Phone Access Mon To Fri. We Therefore Had To Depart Early This Morning ( Mon ) To Enable Calls To Be Received. In Hindsight A Friday Or Saturday Night Stay Would Have Been Better. Missed The Falconry Display - Gutted.,,,,,
,448,The Only Comment I Would Like To Make Is  That I Thought The Cost Of A Pot Of Tea Was Over The Top!,,,,,
,450,See Previous Comment Re Double Charge,,,,,
,451,A Relaxing And Very Pleasant Few Days Break And We Look Forward To Further Visits,,,,,
,452,I Have Visited For The Last Two Years As A Birthday Treat And Will Do So Again Next Year. I Do Not Believe In Putting Negative Comments On Sights Such As Trip Advisor Particularly When I Find The Hotel So Relaxing For A Short Break. I Would However Make The Following Comment About Breakfast. The Scrambled Egg Had Been In The Hot Tray So Long It Had Turned Grey  Similarly The Bacon And Mushrooms Had Been Overcooked And Were Leathery And The Tomatoes Had Become Very Watery. But I Will Be Back. I & Lc Smith,,,,,
,455,We Booked Two Rooms  With 4 Adults  1 Baby In Arms  And 1 Dog In The Party.  All Were Made To Feel At Home And Were Very Well Looked After. The Welcome Gifts For The Dog In Our Room Were Exceptional And Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,456,No - We Had A Very Enjoyable Stay - Apart From The Experience With The Chair - And We Would Certainly Come Again If The Occasion Arises.,,,,,
,459,Hot Breakfast On Cold Plates Is Not Conducive To An Enjoyable Breakfast.  Next Time I Will Order From The A La Carte To Get A Hot Breakfast On A Hot Plate,,,,,
,460,Thank You For A Really Enjoyable Stay And Well Done On Creating Such A Wonderful Hotel,,,,,
,461,Paid Â£26 For Torbay Sole But Actually Had Another Fish Course The Name Of Which I Sadly Cannot Remember But Believe It Was Slightly Cheaper!,,,,,
,463,We Were Presented With The Bill Which We Considered Was Incorrect. However  After Consultation With Reception Staff Who Took It Further It Was Amended To Our Satisfaction.,,,,,
,465,The Inclusive Pickup And Drop Off From Exeter St Davids Really Enhanced The Experience. The Lego Room Service Menu Was Great And Allowed The Grown Ups Precious Extra Minutes In Bed As The Kids Played In The Morning. We Had A Really Lovely Time On This Press Visit. I Only Wish That Bovey Was In My Price Bracket Ordinarily  Which Is Why I Ticked The 'Maybe' For Returning. For Us The Only Issue Is Whether We Can Afford It.,,,,,
,472,Whilst I Paid The Service Charge As I Thought It Was Fantastic  I Don't Feel Others Would And I Am Not Sure It Should Be Put On As Standard.,,,,,
,473,The Service Charge Was Slightly Steep,,,,,
,474,Although I Enjoyed My Stay And Thought In General The Service Was Good  I Feel The Hotel Needs Some Updating In Areas To Ensure The Facilities Match The Service.,,,,,
,476,We Booked The Clay Pigeon Shooting Activity Through The Castle Concierge. We Thoroughly Enjoyed It But On Departing The Activity Centre We Noted That We Had Paid Â£30 Extra Per Person For The Privilege Of Booking Through Bovey Castle. Whilst We Appreciate That The Concierge Will Add A Sum For The Service We Thought It A Bit Much To Add Â£30 Per Person Just For Making A Few Phone Calls! It Is Great That Bovey Castle Can Suggest And Arrange So Many Activities In The Surrounding Area But It Is A Real Shame To Feel Ripped Off After Doing One.,,,,,
,477,Keep Up The Great Work!,,,,,
,478,I Am Afraid We Were Disappointed With The Way The Final Bill Was Handed.  My Husband Signed For Drinks  However  These Were Put On Friends Of Ours Bill.  When Our Friends Queried This  They Were Advised That The Manager Knew Who Was At Fault But That They Would Have To Settle The Account.  Firstly  The Manager Did Not Describe My Husband And My Husband Did Not Know Our Friends Hotel Room And So We Are Disappointed That This Mix Up Happened.  Why Did Our Drinks End Up On Another's Bill?  Secondly We Are Disappointed That If The Manager Knew Who Had Done This To Our Friends (Presumably There Were Other Drinks Not Belonging To Them On Their Bill  Which Were Purposely Put On The Incorrect Room) Why The Manager Did Not Intervene At The Time?,,,,,
,481,The Hawking Day With Martin Was Very Good. It Such A Shame That The Booking Was Confused And We Had To Change Our Plans To Accommodate The Mix Up. I Know Steps Were Taken To Offer An Additional Evening Meal As An Apology For The Poor Dining Experience We Received On Saturday However I Was Really Very Surprised That This Was Still On The Bill And That Service Had Been Added When We Came To Check Out. I Didn't Have The Inclination To Explain Again To Reception.,,,,,
,484,We Loved The Morning Chicken Run  Meeting The Ferrets  The Falconry Display And Beaky The Parrot - All Great Fun For My Nephew And Niece To See. Also  The Convenience Of The Miniature Pony Centre Which Is Down The Road Makes It A Great Location For Families With Younger Kids.,,,,,
,485,We Weren't Given A Choice To Not Pay The Discretionary Service Charge It Was Added To The Bill Without Us Being Aware Of Being Asked If We Wanted To Pay It. Which Is Fine But Not Happy About Paying The Service Charge For The Afternoon Tea.,,,,,
,487,I Understand That There Is No Supervision In The Pool Area  However  Whilst We Were In There  A Group Of Young Teenagers Were Playing Very Loudly With A Ball  Taking Up Most Of The Pool  Diving And Jumping In.  They Had No Consideration For Other Guests  Especially A Very Young Baby Who Was In There At The Time.  I Think That Occasional Visits To The Pool By A Member Of Staff Would Help As They Could Stop Any Behavior Like This.  We Did Highlight It To The Reception When We Got Out Of The Pool - Early.,,,,,
,489,I Enjoyed The Stay But Some Important Features Let You Down. My Husband Travels Ask Over The World With House Of Lords But Its Not Going To Recommend Use Of Bovey,,,,,
,491,It Would Really Make A Difference In This Day & Age If Wifi Was Available For All Guest At No Additional Cost. Particular Since There Is Very Poor Mobile Reception. Thanks For Your Service & Staff  We Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,
,492,I Personally Don't Like The 'Discretionary' Service Charge Being Applied To Everything. I Bought A Packet Of Cigarettes At The Bar  Which At Â£10  Were Dear. To Then Pay Another Â£1-Something Was A Bit Of An Insult. Particularly When The Member Of Staff Who Sold Them To Me Offered Little In The Way Of 'Service'. Whilst I Could Have Asked To Have The Charge Removed  That's Not My Style. I'd Simply Rather Not Be Charged In The First Place.,,,,,
,493,We Were Taken Care Of The Whole Time We Stayed At The Castle And During The Week While We Enjoyed Castle Activities. We Will Definately Be Back As This Hotel Was Part Of A Wonderful Experience In England!,,,,,
,497,The Falconry Display Was Enjoyable.  I Was Grateful For Being Able To Keep My Room For An Extra Half An Hour Or So After The Departure Time To Allow Me To Take My Baby Niece Swimming As Preparing To Go Swimming Had Taken Longer Than We Had Expected,,,,,
,506,I Travelled On This Occasion Without My Husband As He Was Working Away.  He Has Very Much Wanted To Visit Bovey Castle But There Were Too Many Ways In Which The Experience Failed To Meet The Expectations That I Had  And He Now Has No Desire To Stay Here.  For Somewhere That Is Well Known For Its Standards Of Service  I Was Disappointed That There Were So Many Ways In Which It Fell Short.,,,,,
,515,The Staff Were A Credit To The Hotel But The Hotel Was Not A Credit To The Staff.,,,,,
,516,I Was Extremely Impressed  Well Done!!,,,,,
,523,Swimming Pool/Spa Area Are Below The Expected Standard From Such A Place,,,,,
,524,We Were Given A Complimentary Meal But The Service Charge Was Still On Our Bill At Check Out Which Was A Bit Odd. You Should Also Tell Guests They Pay For Newspapers  As This Isn't Always The Case At Hotels And Seemed A Bit Tight For A Hotel Of Your Standard.,,,,,
,529,Nowhere Was It Stated That The Service Charge Was 'Discretionary'. As Far As I Am Aware  We All Had It On Our Bills With No Option To Opt Out Despite Slow Service On A Few Occasions.,,,,,
,530,I Found It Very Difficult To Get Into The Bedroom. The Key Didn't Seem To Fit The Lock Very Well. This Was Frustrating.,,,,,
,532,Service Was Good  But The Room Didn't Meet Expectations Considering The Price. I Felt Breakfast Should Have Been Included.,,,,,
,544,The Clay Pigeon Shooting Was A Great Idea! Ian Did A Great Job  Made It Educational And Fun.,,,,,
,549,The Children's Menu In The Castle Bistro Is Very Limited.  My Son Had The Spaghetti Bolognese  Which Was Simply Spaghetti In A Tomato Sauce.  You Can Do Much Better Than That!!!,,,,,
,550,The Episode With The Service Charges Left A Bad Taste In The Mouth After What Was Up To That Point A Very Enjoyable And Relaxing Stay.,,,,,
,553,You Made The Dogs Feel Very Welcome!,,,,,
,554,Think Whether Private Guests And Weddings Work Together. The Wedding Breakfast Finished Late So All Private Guests Had To Wait For Dinner Beyond Alloyed Times. Tennis Courts Badly Need Resurfacing. Website Said Grass Court Open From May - It Wasn't.,,,,,
,555,Thank You  It Was An Enjoyable Night Away For Us  It Was A Shame The Edwardian Grill Was Unavailable So The Seating For The Evening Meal And Breakfast Were More 'Private Dining' - Hence Our Decision To Go To The Bistro - As This Was Part Of The Reason To Make The Booking. We Dislike That Force Intimacy In Dining  Preferring Rather Anonymity. So Warning Would Have Been Appreciated Prior To Arrival.,,,,,
,558,None,,,,,
,559,I Am Sure That We Just Experienced A Bad Weekend Although Given That Our Visit Was In March I Can Only Assume The Hotel Would Be Busier In Summer Months.,,,,,
,561,Wedding Service Was Good - This Alone!,,,,,
,566,Reception And Staff Were Generally Warm And Friendly With Only One Exception And The Location And Building Were Perfect. Overall An Enjoyable Experience  But Let Down By The Food And Frustrating Tv Service.,,,,,
,567,The Breakfast Order Came Very Slowly Two Days Running. Otherwise All Was Excellent.,,,,,
,569,The Hotel Is Great  With Great Service And Facilities.  The Only Criticism Is The Application Of Service Charge On Many Of The Charges.  It Would Be Simpler To Either Have One Charge Inclusive Of The Charge Or Put Service Charge At The End Of The Bill.  The Room / Food Should Be X Not X Plus Service Charge Of Y.  Many Thanks,,,,,
,576,I Stayed At The Hotel For The Night Of My Wedding  And Unfortunately The Hotel Did Not Meet Our Expectations. The Temperature Of The Hotel Was Uncomfortable  The Elevator Did Not Work  The Service At Breakfast Was Poor And When We Checked Out There Were No Pleasantries From The Reception Staff. However  The Two Chauffeurs We Had Were Very Charming And Helpful.,,,,,
,577,We Were Driven To A Local Pub After A Member Of Reception Staff Mentioned We Could Be Taken And Collected. I Assumed This Was A Service Provided By The Hotel That Was Complementary. I Was A Little Disappointed To Find I Had Been Charged When Checking Out. It Would Have Been Nice If I'd Have Been Told About The Charge Beforehand.,,,,,
,580,We Shall Be Back!,,,,,
,581,I Had Heard The Hotel Is Now Up For Sale And Being A 5* Rating  I Can Only Wonder If This Too Was Also A Reason For The Drop In Overall Customer Experience. I Do Not Know Whether I Would Come To Your Hotel Again  On Business Or Pleasure,,,,,
,582,For Your Marketing Team  I Was Suprised That The Hotel Wasnt On Mr And Mrs Smith.,,,,,
,584,We Pre-Requested Three Things From The Hotel. They Failed To Deliver On All Three. First  There Was No Cot Or Stair Gates In The Lodge. Second  The Lodge Clean Requested For Mid Week Did Not Happen And Third  The Clay Pigeon Shooting Lesson Booked Did Not Take Place As The Instructor Did Not Turn Up. The Alternative Times Offered Were Late In The Afternoon And It Would Have Been Dark. The Staff Were Very Apologetic And Helpful But Three Failures Really Are A Sign That Something Is Going Wrong. The Main Hotel Also Had A Problem With Its Main Open Fire. All The Rooms Were Filled With Smoke. We Therefore Did Not Take Coffee Or Afternoon Tea  Like Previous Years  As All Our Clothes Ended Up Smelling Badly Of Smoke. Such A Shame As All Of These Factors Meant A Loss Of Revenue For The Hotel.,,,,,
,586,I Wish There Is A Nice Manicured Garden Within The Castle Ground.  And  It May Be Good To Have Access To A Toilet After Hole 9 Since It Is Not Located Next To The Club House.,,,,,
,593,Overall A Very Enjoyable Stay  The Room Was Very Comfortable And Spa Very Relaxing  Just A Pity About The Edwardian Restaurant Service At Dinner (It Was Not Much Better At Breakfast Either!).,,,,,
,594,The Bovey Rangers Activities Were Outstanding: Much More Than A Standard Kids' Club.  The Falcon Display And The Owl Experience Were The Highlight Of My Eldest Son's Stay.,,,,,
,595,We Had One Big Hiccup In An Otherwise Great Visit - On Our First Afternoon  Staff Forgot To Pick Kids Up From Their Rangers Activity (Rock Climbing).  They Were An Hour Late  Hungry  And A Bit Upset When They Were Finally Picked Up.  We Got No Apology/Explanation From Staff Afterwards  Which Disappointed Us.  Mistakes Are Inevitable  But Follow Up Is Critical For These Type Of Things.,,,,,
,598,While I Am And Was Happy To Pay Premium Prices For Most Things (Including High Tea) In The Hotel  I Felt That The Price Of A Simple Cup Of Tea Was Very High. I Had A Short Time To Kill So Chose To Wait In One Of The Public Rooms Downstairs And Have A Cup Of Tea. I Was Somewhat Surprised At The Cost (Â£3.50 + Discretionary Service Charge) And Was Consequently Put Off Having Further Hot Beverages Except At Mealtimes Etc And In My Room. A Small Point  But More Normally Priced Simple Hot Drinks Would Make All The Difference To The Ability To Relax Downstairs Between Activities.,,,,,
,599,We Had An Absolutely Wonderful Stay - Overall The Staff Are Amazing  Friendly And Nothing Is Too Much Trouble. I Love The Quiet  Serene Atmosphere And I Plan On Returning Again Before The End Of The Year.,,,,,
,603,I Understand Times Are Hard  But Felt That Somewhere Like Bovey Is A Place To Escape This  But Felt That This Was Being Reflected In Your Standards.,,,,,
,604,Call Me On 01364 661544 Once You Have Decided What You Intend Doing About The Issues I Had.,,,,,
,609,The People Are Really The Hotel's Best Asset- The Warm Welcome And Ease Of Booking And Check-In Were Truly Memorable.  Generally We Felt Very Much At Home And This Was Due To The Ready Smiles And Easy  Friendly Interactions We Had With Staff.  Our Toddler Had The Best Time  Which Was The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Stay.,,,,,
,610,Had Coffee On The Sunday Morning.  Asked For A Pot For 2.  Instead Got 2 Very Small Cups With Luke Warm Coffee  No Offer Of A Top Up And Was Charged The Most Ridiculous Price For It.,,,,,
,612,Regarding Question 26  Other Than The Spa Where It Was Specifically Pointed Out  I Don't Recall Having Had Any Choice Regarding The Service Charge.,,,,,
,614,Overall We Had A Wonderful Stay And Would Certainly Recommend It. The Birds Of Prey Display Was Very Enjoyable!,,,,,
,616,Overall  Another Great Experience,,,,,
,617,Found Drinks In Bar Expensive,,,,,
,619,Yes. We Stayed In Armstor. Almost All The Time  The Rope Closed The Buggie Path In Front Of The Lodges  Therefore Often We Had To Drive The Buggie Over The Grass If Coming Back From Activities Or The Front Of The 'Castle'. Alternatively We Could Drive The Buggie Behind The Lodges. On One Day  We Had An Accident. It Does Not Help  When The Car/Van Belonging To The Housekeeping And Also Their Buggies Block The Paths - In This Case Outside Claret Tor - We Had To Manoeuvre Around The Blockage Onto The Grass To The Side Of The Tree. It Had Been Raining And Although We Were Almost Stationary The Brakes And Wheels Locked And The Buggie Slid And Could Not Be Stopped. We Had A Bad Accident  My Son Falling Out Of The Buggie  Hitting A Rock And Trapping His Leg Between The Buggie And The Rock. Fortunately After X-Rays He Was Ok  But The Result Could Have Been A Lot Lot Worse. Please Look Into This As I Would Like To Discuss.,,,,,
,623,Overall A Lovely Stay With A Large Family Group - Some Small Improvements Could Be Made Which Would Put You In The 'Excellent' Category.,,,,,
,627,It's A Very Strange Policy To Add Service Charge When You're Ordering A Drink In The Bar.,,,,,
,628,Lego Room Service Was Genius! The Quad Biking And Fly Fishing Were Very Good.,,,,,
,632,The Grounds Are Beautiful  The Golf Course Is Stunning  The Men On Our Trip Very Much Enjoyed The Clay Pigeon Shooting We Had Arranged.  The Lodges Are Just Fantastic And We Really Really Enjoyed Our Stay With You.,,,,,
,633,I Tried To Book A Room For The Rest Of My Family - Wife And 3 Children For The Saturday Night To Follow On From The 2 Night Business Trip I Had And Was Disappointed On The Cost Of That- I Was Left A Telephone Message That It Would Cost In Excess Of Â£650 Rooms Only ( 2 Rooms Needed)- We Would Have Used The Spa And Eaten At The Restaurant-,,,,,
,635,Fantastic Birthday Cake Delivered To The Room (I Had Preordered This). Delicious. Compliments To The Chef!,,,,,
,636,Fantastic Setting  Lots Of Lovely People  Have Visited Many Times  Just Some Minor Points That Would Make It Top End Rather Than Just Average For The Cost..,,,,,
,637,Despite The Previous Comments  We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Experience And Will Certainly Be Back Again. We Feel It Is Our Special Getaway. Thank You.,,,,,
,638,I Had A Fantastic Time At The Wedding I Went To At Bovey Because It Is A Beautiful Hotel In A Naturally Stunning Spot And The Company Was Great (Ie. The Wedding Party And Guests). However  My Enjoyment Was Certainly Not Enhanced By The Staff Who I Encountered At The Hotel. My Partner And I Who Have Stayed At A Number Of 5 Star Hotels Throughout The World Actually Found It Very Funny To Compare The Staffing Of Bovey To Fawlty Towers!!!,,,,,
,643,When My Husband Booked Bovey The Receptionist Wasn't Entirely Clear About The Room Rate And Wasn't Very Confident On The Telephone.  Also  We Were Quite Surprised This Time At All The Extra Charges.,,,,,
,650,As Discussed With Franco I Was Disappointed The Pick Up Service In Exeter Cost Â£72 Though We Were Never Informed Be By Sammy On Phone This Was The Case. When You Spend Hundreds Of Pounds It Is Annoying To Be Ripped Off Like This. Franco Reduced To Â£45 But Not Satisfactory. We Cancelled The Return Journey And Ordered The First Taxi Company (Zed Cars) On The Internet. This Cost Â£35.  The Castle  The Grounds  And The Walks In The Area Are Spectacular.  Poratm@Gmail.Com (Miriam Porat) Waynestalley@Hotmail.Com (Wayne Stalley) 07826 924 266,,,,,
,651,We Will Return  But Probably Not For As Long A Stay.  Fwiw  The Competition From Our Perspective Is Babbington House  Ickworth  Fowey Hall  Four Seasons Hampshire  Priory Bay Isle Of Wight  Or Going Abroad.,,,,,
,652,Bovey Is A Very Special Hotel In An Amazing Location With A Fantastic Staff And Is The Ideal Retreat To Visit And Relax.  The Manager Frederico Is Always Very Visible And Welcoming And There Is A Wonderfully Relaxing Ambience About The Hotel.  Thanks.,,,,,
,653,Bovey Is Very Addictive For The Atmosphere And Location And The Staff Are Fantastic.  This Is Why We Keep Returning!,,,,,
,659,A Great First Visit To Your Lovely Hotel - We Will Come Back - Mainly Due To Your Excellent Staff Who Were So Very Friendly Without Being Intrusive Or Over-Bearing.  Thank You!,,,,,
,660,Thanks  It Is A Beautiful Property And We Had A Good Time.  Just A Bit Of Feedback  We Generally Don't Balk At Paying High Prices For Food At Hotels  But After The First Night We Did Not Eat At The Hotel  Even Going So Far As To Have Cereal In Our Room For Breakfast. That Suggests To Us That You Have Got The Price Poit For Your Food A Little High.  On Booking  The Price Offered When Emailing Your Staff Was About 100 Pounds Per Night More Than Was On The Website.  That Was Weird And Didn't Build Trust.,,,,,
,661,When Compared To Other Similar Hotels  We Felt That The Hotel Was Priced On The High Side. A Good Comparison Is Fawsley Hall.,,,,,
,667,The Whole Stay Was Excellent  The Only Thing That Let It Down Was Breakfast  It Was Very Unorganised.  I Recommend Having Table Numbers And Staff Only Looking After A Number Of Tables Rather Than All Staff Waiting On All Tables As This Was Very Unorganised (And We Had About 8 Different People Attend To Us).  We Witnessed Food Coming Out Of The Kitchens And The Staff Not Knowing Which Table It Was For - This Happened A Number Of Times And There Was A Long Delay In Us Actually Getting Our Food.  This Was The Only Part Of The Whole Hotel Experience That I Felt Let It Down.  Other Than Breakfast It Is A Fab Hotel. :-),,,,,
,668,We Booked Afternoon Tea  But The Booking Had Not Been Transferred To The Catering Staff. They Rushed To Accommodate Us  But We Were Served In The Oak Room Which Was Slightly Disappointing (Only Marginally As Still A Wonderful Room). Things Were Then Quite Disorganised  3 People Came To Lay Our Table  But None Give Us A Menu Or To Take Our Order For Quite Some Time. We Asked For No Salmon  Salmon Arrived  The Orders For Both Couples Either Side Of Us Also Arrived Incorrectly.  None Of This Was Particularly Bad  Just Unexpected When Everything Else Had Been To Such A High Standard.,,,,,
,671,My Email Address Is Steve@Stevesullivan.Co.Uk,,,,,
,672,The Soap Dish In Room 13 Kept Falling Off The Shower Wall - Its Not Screwed In  Its Just Sitting Unattached So When You Put Anything On It  It Falls Off.    I Also Found The Hotel Tv Channels A Bit Annoying To Find Simple Channels Like Bbc1 Etc You Had To Keep Going Through The Whole Welcome Menu Each Time  - It Seemed A Bit Of A Awkward.,,,,,
,676,If You Want People To Come For Short Breaks To Try The Hotel And Facility You Need To Ensure Eh Are Treated Well As Others And Valued.,,,,,
,680,No,,,,,
,683,Thank You For A Wonderful Holiday. The Service Has Improved Since Our Last Stay.,,,,,
,685,Paid The Discretionary Service Charge And Tipped On Top For The People That Helped With The Luggage  Restaurant And Room Service - The Girl That Brought The Room Service Was Exhausted.,,,,,
,688,See Trip Advisor,,,,,
,700,This Survey Could Tell You How Many More Questions There Are To Answer As You Go Along!,,,,,
,702,We Had A Very Enjoyable Stay And Will Be Back Again.,,,,,
,703,I Think The 5% Service Surcharge On The Room On The Final Bill Was Really Not Appropriate But I Was Happy To Pay Extra Becuase Of The Extra Mile The Staff (Especially Federico) Went For Us Was Worth The Extra Money.,,,,,
,704,Fabulous Place.  Fabulous Experience.  Keep It Up!,,,,,
,705,Your Staff And Setting Are Fantastic.  If Anything Keeps Us Away It Woukld Be Your Internet Capabilites And Quality Of The Food Offered On The Grounds.,,,,,
,706,Overall  A Very Relaxing And Enjoyable Night Away. Thank You!,,,,,
,707,Just Be More Explicit With The Charging.,,,,,
,710,Would Have Been Nice To Know Why The Bathroom Leaked Having Being Woken At 7.30 On Sunday To Say A Workman Was Coming To Fix It. He Arrive And Said He Could Not Find Anything Yet Water Was Everywhere.,,,,,
,713,See Comment Earlier For Reason Behind Departure Score.,,,,,
,716,Evenings Were Hot And So Whilst At Dinner Left Window Open But Returned To Find It Closed Again  And So Whilst I Understand Rooms Should Be Tidied Other Things Can Be Left Rather Than Making Up Room Exactly As Before.,,,,,
,717,Excellent Falconry Talk-Informative & Entertaining,,,,,
,718,Not As Child Friendly If Staying With A Young Child (Under 3).  Better For Bigger Kids.  Most Child Friendly Hotels Have A Small Pool  However Small  For The Little Kids.  Otherwise  Our Stay Was Fine.  Would Return But Not Until Our Youngest Is A Bit Older And The Food And Service Are Improved At The Bistro.,,,,,
,720,I Found The Service Charge To Be Totally Unwarranted And Tacky. Service Was Very Poor And I Even Had  Room Keeping Enter My Room By A Key Without Knocking First. The Gentlemen Was Very Apologetic So I Don't Have A Direct Complaint About The Individual But I Would Suspect He Lacked Proper Hotel Training. Bovey Castle Is An Amazing Venue And I Would Like To Return But Would Have A Low Expectation Of Service And Would Only Be Returning For The Location Itself. I Only Paid Half Of The Service Charges Which I Even Felt Unwarranted. My Children Really Enjoyed The Canoeing Activity In Bovey Rangers And The Staff Operating This Were Excellent. I Was Very Disappointed To Find That At The End Of The Activity No One From The Hotel Came To Collect The Children. I Offered To Take All The Children Back To The Hotel And When I Mentioned This To The Reception Staff They Were Very Uninterested And Immediately Blamed The Canoeing Instructors. I Found This To Be Very Unprofessional And Arrogant As It Is The Hotel That Offer The Service And Should Take The Childrens Welfare Seriously.,,,,,
,721,Overall Bovey Sells Itself With A Combination Of Wonderful Public Rooms  Amazing Setting  And Almost Without Exception Excellent Service.  We Will Certainly Return. It Was Also Very Child Friendly And Our 5 Year Old Loved It.,,,,,
,729,Beautiful Hotel And Really Great In Every Other Way.,,,,,
,737,I Think You Should Stay At A 4 Seasons Hotel And See How They Do Things!,,,,,
,738,The Children Appreciated The Kid Sized Robes And Slippers.  They Enjoyed The Rubber Ducks For The Bath.  They Loved The Pool.,,,,,
,740,The Setting  Public Rooms And Staff Were Fantastic.  However  The Bedrooms Were Extremely Disappointing.  We Even Had To Move Rooms Due To A Water Leak.  The Staff Were Very Accommpodating About This But It Was A Huge Inconvenience To Move (Particularly With A 4 Month Old Baby) And I Feel We Should Have Been Upgraded (The Hotel Was Not Full) Or Been Offered A Discount On Checking Out.,,,,,
,743,Thank You For A Very Enjoyable Stay.,,,,,
,744,Thanks For Another Lovely Stay - We Hope To Be Back Very Soon!,,,,,
,745,Thank You For Another Lovely Break.,,,,,
,757,I Was Not Told About The Service Charges Being Optional And Paid Our Bill In Full I Was A Bit Surprised To Find We Were Charged For Our Drinks Being Brought To Our Table And Also For Our Dinner Being Brought To Us,,,,,
,762,A Disappointing Experience. We Were Given Vouchers As A Wedding Gift But Unfortunately Our Expectations Were Not Met. The Reception Staff Were Polite And Helpful Both When Booking And When Requesting A Refund For The  Service Charge Although This Should Not Have Occurred - Especially For The Accommodation,,,,,
,763,Initially The Experience Fell Well Below My Expectations  But The Issue Was Dealt With In An Efficient And Understanding Way.  I Would Not Have Been Happy If There Was No Alternative To Room 15.   Evening Meal And Breakfast Were Both Excellent.,,,,,
,766,Thanks - We Always Enjoy Ourselves,,,,,
,767,We Didnâ´T Like The Interior In The Restaurant And Expecially Bistro  Thatâ´S Why We Ate Outside For Diner And Breakfast As Well  Only Teatime In The Rooms With Fireplace Was Nice.,,,,,
,771,All Dogs Were To Be Kept On Leads At All Times  However We Came Across 4 Dogs That Were Not And Two Dogs Were Just Left To Wander Around The Castle And Grounds With The Owners Not Paying Much Attention To Them And What They Were Doing.  My Wife Has A Phobia With Dogs  So Was Disappointed That Other Guests Were Not Sticking To The Rules  As My Wife Felt Very Uncomfortable At Times.,,,,,
,772,Falls Significantly Below The Industry Average In My Experiences.,,,,,
,773,Would Certainly Consider Staying Here Again  It Was A Good Base For Exploring The Surrounding Countryside.,,,,,
,777,We Called To Book For A Cab - Very Difficult To Get Through To Reception. The Charge For The Cab Was Put On The Account Without Asking If This Was How Would Like To Settle It And Another Â£7.00 Was Added. I Appreciate This Is Normal But A High %.   I Was Surprised To Be Charged For A Newspaper In A 5 Star Hotel.,,,,,
,778,The Castle Bistro Is Quite Disappointing  I Think A Few Changes Could Be Made To Easily Improve  Atmosphere And Service.,,,,,
,781,Bovey Castle Is Such A Wonderful Place And It Is Always A Great Experience Visiting The Hotel With Such Gorgeous Countryside  Beautiful Food (Cream Teas Are To Die For!) And Wonderfully Helpful Staff. I Wish I Could Afford To Bring My Family Here As The Kids Would Love It! Oh Well - I Will Just Have To Enjoy The Business Visits :-),,,,,
,786,Babysitting Is Expensive At Â£20 Per Hour Compared To Similar 5 Star Hotels And It Is Rather Cheeky Then To Add Service Charge On Top Of That. Also I Think It Is Rather Odd To Still Charge For Broadband When Your Guests Are Paying Â£400 A Night.,,,,,
,787,The Dog Friendliness Is An Asset.,,,,,
,789,I'd Look To Improve The Quality Of The Wine Cellar And The Presentation Of The Wine List.,,,,,
,792,Our Bill Was Incorrect In Two Places But I Must Add That Gemma Sorted It Out For Us And Gave Us A Refund.  So Thank You.,,,,,
,795,Having A Hawk Eye I Noticed That There Were Cob Webs On Some Lamps And Dust On Shelves In The Bar And Library. There Should Be Someone In Charge Of Inspecting Rooms To Make Sure They Are Immaculate. The Bistro Floor Had Spilt Food On The Floor Beneath The Tables! A Few More Standing Lamps In The Bar And Library Would Be Better For Those Of Us Who Like To Read Late In The Day And Have Old Eyes!,,,,,
,798,A Very Pleasant Stay. Only Comment Was That When We Moved From The Lodge To The Hotel Room We Had Initially Been Charged Twice For The First Night Stay In The Lodge. I Had To Mention This To Reception But Would Have Hoped That They Would Have Noticed It First Before Giving Me The Interim Invoice. Otherwise All Else Was Very Good.,,,,,
,799,Jaystone Lodge Looked A Bit Tired In Decor,,,,,
,800,No,,,,,
,801,The Carpet In The Edwardian Grill Was Shabby And Let The Lovely Decor Down. It Needs Bringing Up To Date.,,,,,
,802,If You Weren't So Far Away From London We Would Likely Visit Again.  As It Is  It Is A Long Way To Go For A Short Break  But We Hope To Visit Again.,,,,,
,803,Overall A Lovely Few Days. Thank You.,,,,,
,804,Overall We Love Staying At Bovey Castle  So We Will Be Back :-),,,,,
,810,The Staff At The Restaurant Was Friendly But Was Laughing And Talking As Guest Arrived.  The Food At The Restaurant Was Excellent But Every Day The Same. It Is Strange That You Book Three Course Half-Board And Then You Hear That You Have 45 Pounds To Spend Or Not. Why Is It Not Possible To Have Sunday Lunch Or Afternoon Tea Instead?,,,,,
,816,Whilst Most Staff Were Pleasant  There Was Often No Sense Of Pride  Or Ownership. Also Felt In Some Areas  Esp F&B  You Were Understaffed. Pool Had Missing Tiles & Would Benefit From F&B Service.,,,,,
,817,We Have Been In The Training Environment For A Number Of Years And Would Just Like To Praise You For The Level Of Staff Training Which Has Obviously Gone On. Each Member Of Staff Knew How To Handle Visitors And Their Requests And The Level Of Service Due To That Training Was Outstanding.,,,,,
,820,I Needed Some Flour To Cook With In The Lodge - The Kitchens Supplied Some For Me Which Was Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,823,Just One Comment About The Teaspoons In The Lodges.  With The Exceptionally Tall Coffee/Tea Mugs  You May Wish To Consider Longer Teaspoons.,,,,,
,824,Very Disappointed!,,,,,
,829,Review Catering.,,,,,
,830,You Can Probably Tell From My Comments The Additional Charges Added To The Bill Is Not Acceptable  You Should Be Asked Before This Is Added. For Example A Service Charge Of Â£17.50 On The Dinner Bill Which Was Â£70 A Head Before The Service Charge Is Excessive In My Opinion. This Put The Only Dark Cloud On This Stay,,,,,
,831,Apart From The Fact I Dont Agree With The Service Charge Policy And Expect It To Be Discretionary It Was A Verypleasant Stay.  Exceptional Customer Service Should Be The Standard And Not Dependant On Tipping Or Bonus's. I Would Prefer The Hotels' Charges To Refelct This And Then I Can Make Choices Based On The Charges In Front Of Me And Not Pay Twice,,,,,
,832,See You Soon Hopefully!,,,,,
,833,It's A Beautiful And Unique Place.  Just Felt That The Bedroom And It's Cleanliness Let It Down (Not The Day Today Cleanliness But The Cleanliness Of Walls  Blinds And Furnishings).  The Room We Were In No. 11 Was Not In A Good Part Of The Hotel And We Wouldn't Recommend Anyone Books A Room There Who Wants Peace!,,,,,
,835,Lovely Experience And These Are Trivial Comments Offered In The Spirit Of Helping The Hotel Maintain And Exceed Their High Standards.,,,,,
,836,Lovely Hotel. Lovely Setting. Falcon Display Was Very Interesting / Entertaining / Memorable. We Wish You And The Staff Every Success With The Hotel. I Would Reassure You That I Don't Intend Giving Feedback On Review Sites.,,,,,
,838,I Found All The Additional Discretionaory Service Charges Very Confusing And Added Substantially To The Total Bill,,,,,
,839,Bovey Markets Itself On Understated Luxury And In The Past I Have Always Felt That It Delivered. I Love The Place ; The Location  The Golf Course And The General Feel Of The Place Has Always Made Me Want To Come Back. This Time  However  I Felt It Had Lost It's Lustre And At The Price Range That It Sits At  I Believe Some Attention Needs To Be Given To The Little Things That Will Bring Back The Sparkle.,,,,,
,841,Exceptional Experience Which We Thoroughly Enjoyed. Ironically Some Of The Staff Didn't Seem To Enjoy Their Work Especially The Foreign Staff Was Disappointing. We Have Been In Hospitality And You Need To Enjoy It Or It Is Hard Work. Overall 4.7 Out Of 5  Would Not Take Much To Get To 5!,,,,,
,847,The Tennis Courts Are Getting Shabby,,,,,
,848,Prices Of Activities Were Rather Too High,,,,,
,849,Initially Did Have Trouble With Booking The Stay With The Internet Reservation Page  That Was During Eastern Standard Time In The Us About 9 Am.  I Did Wait A 24 Hour Period And Then Made The Reservation During Eastern Standard Time Around 11:30 Pm.  I Was Attempting To Place The Reservation During Uk Time Which Worked.  That Was The Only Difficulty That Was Experienced.  Everyone Was Attentive And Great!,,,,,
,850,A Lovely Stay - It Is A Shame It Was So Short.  Many Thanks To All,,,,,
,852,When You Keep A Guest From Using The Public Rooms Of The Hotel Due To A Wedding  Don't Tell Them That The Wedding Party Has Paid Handsomely For Private Use Of The Facility - As A Guest  So Did I !! Do I Get A Refund For Not Having Access ?,,,,,
,853,I Want To Stress That Overall My Wife And I Had A Lovely Stay At Bovey Castle. However  Because Of The Issues In The Restaurant  I Cannot Be Sure That We Would Come Back Or Be Able To 100% Recommend To Friends And Family. The Issues May Seem Like Minor Details  But At A Hotel Of Your Standard  They Should Not Be Happening. We Come Because The Small Details Are Taken Care Of.,,,,,
,854,Discretionary Service Is Not Really That Discretionary As It Is Automatically Put On The Bill ( Default Position) And Puts One In An Awkward Situation If You Don't Want To Pay It (Active Position). Fortunately  However I Was Happy To Do So.,,,,,
,857,We Stayed In A Family Suite. Both Rooms Were Rather Chilly During The Day.,,,,,
,858,We Had A Dinner  Reservation For 8.30  We Sat Down For A Drink At 8.10 & Were Still Sat Waiting For Our Drinks At 8.35  By The Time We Actually Sat Down & Ate It Was Gone 9Pm. The Service In The Bar Was Very Slow  It Was Not Busy  There Were Only 6 People Having Drinks Before Dinner  That Said The Cocktails Were Excellent.,,,,,
,859,No - Just Get The Heating Turned Down A Bit.,,,,,
,862,Your Falconer Was Great Fun. Breakfast Was Good With The Exception Of The Coffee Which Was Shocking,,,,,
,863,We Stayed At With You Two Years Ago And The Experience Was Beyond Our Expectations.  This Time There Were Too Many Things That Were Not Up To Standard.  Our Bathroom Was Very Cold And Never Heated Up. The Milk In The Room For Tea And Coffee Had Gone Off. There Was A Mistake On The Final Bill Charging Us For Drinks We Had Not Ordered. My Partner's Steak Was Extremely Gristly And He Could Only Eat Half Of It. We Were Told By The Restaurant Staff That We Would Not Be Charged For 'The Cheese.' When We Came To Pay The Bill  There Was No Mention Of Any Compensation Of Any Kind.,,,,,
,865,Highly Recommendable Hotel,,,,,
,866,Thank You,,,,,
,872,Beautiful Place  Wonderful Care And Facilities - The Only Reason We Won't Be Back Is That It Is A Little Out Of Our Normal League!,,,,,
,876,Personally I Am Local And Live Only At Kingsteignton.  Hence I Was Looking Forward To My Stay.  However  With My Role I Spend A Lot Of My Working Week In Hotels And Thought This Experience Would Be A Wow.  Unfortunatley It Was Not.  The Room Was Space  Old  And Very Dated.  On A Positive The Bed Was Very Comfy Together With The Pillows.,,,,,
,877,Phone Bill Of Collegue Was Very High For Time Used,,,,,
,884,A Further Disappointment Was The Cancellation Of The Falconry Display  Although We Appreciate There Were Only A Small Number Of Guests Staying. This We Found Out After Waiting For 15 Minutes On The Terrace And Then Going To Ask At Reception.,,,,,
,885,Our Visit Coincided With That Of Several Large Families And The Noise Made By Many Children Running On The Wooden Floor Above Our Room Was Very Intrusive And Detracted From The Stay.,,,,,
,886,We Totally Disagreed With A 12.5% Service Charge Being Added To Our Bill. When Paying High Prices To Stay In A Luxury Hotel  We Would Expect To Receive A High Level Of Service As Part Of The Overall Price And Not Be Expected To Pay Extra For That. We Have Stayed In Lovely Hotels Prior To This And Have Never Been Expected To Pay For The Service. A Tip Would Be Left If We Decided To Leave One. It Was Not Added To Bill. When Querying This We Felt It Quite Difficult To Ask For It To Be Removed. This Has Put Us Off Staying At Bovey Again.,,,,,
,887,Overall A Nice Place  Pleasant Staff. The Staff In The Bistro Were Very Accomodating And Helpful On Friday Evening When We Have A Grooms Dinner.,,,,,
,888,We Appreciated The Attentiveness Of The Staff And Enjoyed That They Were From Different Parts Of Europe And The World. It Brought An International Feeling To What Could Have Otherwise Been Quite A Provincial Establishment.,,,,,
,891,We Are Very Appreciative Of The Wonderful Location And Excellent Facilities That Are Available To Us.  We Had A Thoroughly Enjoyable Stay.,,,,,
,893,The Confirmation Letter Was Very Misleading As It Quoted A 'Nightly Rate' And Then Went On To Tell Us About Changes In Rates During Our Stay  But None Of These Tied In With The Rate We Were Quoted In The Nightly Rate.  Therefore We Thought That This Was Just For Our Information And That It Didn't Apply.  A Nightly Rate Should Mean A Nightly Rate.,,,,,
,894,Great Job.,,,,,
,896,Lovely Hotel,,,,,
,898,Hotels Certainly Take Hard Wear From Their Guests And Our Suite Was Showing Its Use With Water Stained Ceiling  Chipped Furniture Legs And Worn Fabrics. Time For A Refresh!,,,,,
,900,Lovely Hotel  Would Love To Stay Again,,,,,
,901,We Had Afternoon Tea - Excellent  But We Would Have Liked To Have Known Exactly What We Had! Not A Complaint  It Was All Lovely.,,,,,
,902,We Enjoyed Our Two Nights With You. Food Including Breakfast Was Very Good.,,,,,
,906,Childrens Programme Was Excellent.,,,,,
,911,We Had Booked For 2 Nights But Left After 1 Night. We Had Left 2 Small Children At Home And Both Of Us Had Minor Work Commitments While At Bovey. Not Having Mobile/Email Service Was A Big Inconvenience- Having To Worry About Children At Home And Work Related. We Paid 359 For The Second Night Even Though We Checked Out One Day Early.   Brian Weinstein,,,,,
,914,My Other Point Would Be That I'd Expect It To Be Perfectly Possible To Sit In Public Areas Of The Hotel Freely  To Read  Talk Or Whatever.  I'm Sure It's Possible To Do This Sometimes But We Tried To Sit In The Sitting Rooms One Afternoon  To Find That Impossible - The Rooms Were Pretty Empty But Each Table Had A Reserved Sign On It And We Were Told They Were All Booked.  They Had All Been Reserved For Afternoon Teas.  There's Nothing Wrong With Selling Afternoon Teas But I Don't Think That Should Mean That Hotel Guests Are Left With No Sitting Room To Use.,,,,,
,920,The Lodges Are Lovely - A Bit Hot But We Enjoyed Our Stay Thank You,,,,,
,922,Expected Slightly Better For The Cost  Some Carpets On Stairs Threadbare  Outside Furniture Needed Refurbishing ,,,,,
,925,Great Welcome For Our Dog Great Of Friendly Hotel.  We Felt Very Comfortable With Him In The Hotel. Thank You.  Lovely Grounds As Well Super Robes Not Horrible Stiff Towelling Robes But Nice Soft Comfortable Robe.  Nice Bathroom,,,,,
,928,The Location And Atmosphere Of Bovey Castle Along With Your Excellent Staff Saved The Day And Made The Few Issues We Had Quite Inconsequential In Comparison To The Experience As A Whole. Rest Assured We Will Not Be Visiting Trip Advisor To Nitpick.,,,,,
,929,Very Special And Friendly Young Staff Really Made Our Stay Enjoyable,,,,,
,930,We Had A Problem At Breakfast As The Arbroath Smokie You Had On The Menu Was Not Arbroath Smokie (We Come From Arbroath So Were Very Disappointed).  I Hope You Have Changed Your Menu As The Arbroath Smokie Is A European Commission Protected Food Name.,,,,,
,933,We Just Loved Being At Bovey Castle - The Decor And Accessories Were Superb And The Grounds Were Soothing And Superbly Maintained  The Staff Could Not Have Been Better.,,,,,
,938,We Have Been Several Times From When Peter De Savary Ran The Hotel  And We Love The Location And Building And Pool  And I Am Sure We Will Return Again  And I Would Recommend The Hotel To Friends! Always Enjoy The Falconry Display. Not Sure About The Reservation Of All The Main Sitting Areas For Tea-Time  In Advance!,,,,,
,939,Breakfast Was A Disappointing Experience.  The Presentation And Quality Of The Cooked Food Was Not Of The Standard We Would Expect For This Type Of Hotel.  My Poached Eggs And Bacon On Toast Looked Like It Was From Little Chef And The Bacon Was Very Thick  Fatty And Unedible.  We Have Recently Stayed In The Scarlet At Mawgan Porth In Cornwall And Their Breakfasts Were Far Superior In Quality And Presentation.,,,,,
,946,The Hotel And Setting Is Beautiful And We Had A Lovely Stay. The Only Aspect That Stopped It From Being Perfect Was The Meal In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,948,The Breakfast Experience Was A Little Strange Offering Self Service Cooked Breakfast On Cold Plates Or Breakfast To Order From The Menu   We Had To Wait 10 Minutes To Be Seated For Breakfast And Our Waiter Couldn't Understand That We Didn't Want Black Pudding Or Hogs Pudding As The Food Came On The Plate Anyway.,,,,,
,960,The Service Charges Were Not As Clear As I Would Expect On The Website.,,,,,
,968,I Reluctantly Mark Question 22 As Falling Below Expectation Because We Had To Wait A Long Time In The Bar (15 Minutes) Before We Were Asked If We Would Like A Drink Or A Dinner Menu; And The Meal In The Edwardian Grill Was Disappointing. However  There Was A Wedding On And Perhaps Staff Were Stretched.  We Have Always Been Very Pleased With Our Previous Experiences At Bovey Castle And Would Like To Think This Was Just A One-Off.  Regarding Our Room  Without Our Knowledge  A Friend Had Rung The Hotel Before Our Arrival And Asked If We Could Be Upgraded.  The Hotel Kindly Obliged And We Very Much Enjoyed The Upgraded Room.  Many Thanks.,,,,,
,969,Get A Nespresso In The Room With A Few Pods. Get Radio 4 On The Tv.,,,,,
,971,My Daughter Had A Bathrobe But We Did Not.  Tel. Reception And They Said Housekeeping Would Sort It Out.  I Was Hoping To Use My After My Swim But Had To Settle For Just A Towel.  Our Robes Arrived When The Beds Were Let Down  Bit Late Then As We Did Not Use Them.,,,,,
,973,The Fly Fishing Lesson Was An Amazing Experience With A Great Teacher. The Golf Practice Area Is Exceptional.,,,,,
,975,Thanks A Lot For Upgrading Us In A Room With Garden View. It Was A Present For My Mothers 70Th Birthday And That Was Really A Nice Surprise Of You.,,,,,
,979,Staff That Understand/Speak English Would Be My Choice!,,,,,
,980,The Venue Was Stunning And Everything Was Really Wonderful.  However I Understand Two People In Our Party Suffered Theft From Their Rooms  So That Was Of Some Concern To Us All.,,,,,
,982,Did No Feel The Golf Course Justified The Fees Charged.,,,,,
,983,Great Weekend Get Away.,,,,,
,985,Overpriced - Not Up To A 5 Star Hotel - Staff Friendly But Not Experienced/ Notably Local Knowledge Or Anything To Do With Fishing,,,,,
,987,Beautiful Setting ---Lovely Rooms ---But Things Need To Be Followed Through And The Piano Bar Should Be Child Free After 8 At Night ---It Is Disrespectful To The Piano Player And Other Guests.,,,,,
,989,Reduce Ur Prices A Little Bit  Feel The Room We Had Was Alot Of Money & Stayed In Better Places With More Friendly Staff .,,,,,
,992,I Don't Mind Service Charges But Prefer To Give Tips As And When I Choose. I Did Not At All Like The Service Charge On Room Rates And The Registration Charges Added To My Draft Account. Service Charge On Dinner Also Inappropriate And Excessive.,,,,,
,993,Was Expecting The Bedroom To Be More Luxurious,,,,,
,994,Only That Our Breakfast Was Of A Poorer Standard Than I Have Previously Experienced At The Hotel. The Bacon Was Almost Inedible  (Very Dry And Appeared To Have Been In An Oven For Some Period Of Time) And The Coffee Also Didn't Taste Fresh And Was Lukewarm. I Was Reluctant To Complain At The Time  As I Didn't Want To Interupt Our Breakfast By Waiting For More To Be Cooked. But I Did Mention It To The Girl On Reception When We Checked Out  So That She Could Pass Our Comments Back To The Kitchen.,,,,,
,997,Have Posted A Note On Trip Advisor,,,,,
,998,I Guess I Should Also Mention The Fellow Who Comes At 10 Am With His Magnificent Birds.  He Is Quite A Character.  We Found His Presentation To Be Fun And Very Informative.,,,,,
,999,Booked Via Golf Brakes And Surprised That Their Rate Was Better Than Booking With The Hotel Direct.,,,,,
,1000,N/A,,,,,
,1001,We Enjoyed Our Stay Very Much. We Used Many Of The Facilities During Our Stay  Including The Cars  Which Were Driven By Uniformed Staff To The Ring Of Bells; This Added To The Quality Of The Experience. Also Enjoyed The 'Don't Go To Strangers' Video Which Seemed To Capture The Relaxed Essence Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,1002,The Position Regarding Car Keys Was Unclear. On One Occasion  I Was Asked To Leave My Keys At The Desk And All That Happened Was That The Member Of Staff Reversed My Car Out Of The Space And Then Reversed Back In Apparently Just So That It Could Be Facing Forwards! There Was Also A Worry That I Might Get Blocked In Sometime. I Think That You Need To Properly Mark Out Car Spaces So That There Is No Confusion.,,,,,
,1006,You Have An Exquisite Building  An Exceptional Location  The Grounds Are Ravishing And I Loved The Extra Touches Especially The Falconry Display.  It Is Such A Shame All This Was Ruined By A Dreadful Dining Experience And Poorly Trained Restaurant Staff.  I Suspect That Many Of Your Guests Take Advantage Of The Special Deals And Are Therefore Happy With What's Included.  However  A Restaurant Serving Good Quality  Value For Money Fare Is Essential To Any Hotel's Survival.  You Are Charging Michelin Prices And Serving Sub Standard Food.  I Also Think You Should Enforce A Dress Code In The Restaurant - Track Suits Are No Place In A 'Fine Dining' Restaurant. Also  Although I Thought The Swimming Pool Was Lovely  The Changing Rooms Are Too Cramped And There Is No Privacy Or Security.  I Am Sorry About These Negative Comments.  It Is Such A Shame As Bovey Castle Has A Wow Factor Which Doesn't Carry Through.,,,,,
,1007,Thank You For Asking For My Comments.  I Hope The Few Things I've Mentioned Can Be Corrected.,,,,,
,1008,Loved The Falconry Demonstration.,,,,,
,1017,A Really Lovely Relaxing Experience  We Will Be Back Later In The Year,,,,,
,1019,Had Afternoon Tea Before We Left Which Was Excellent. Was Slightly Bemused To Be Served Cold Tea  Which Was Sorted Quickly Once We Had Spoken To The Person Serving. First Choice Of Tea Wasn't Available Either.,,,,,
,1020,Bistro Is Substandard To Rest Of Castle Atmosphere As Was A Temporary (In Appearance) Shade Marquis On Top Terrace,,,,,
,1021,This Is A Gorgeous Hotel And Seems A Shame It Was So Quiet.  I Do Think The Edwardian Menu Needs A Review (To Make It More Dynamic And Exciting But Perhaps A Little Less Expensive Or Wow The Punters1),,,,,
,1023,Thank You So Much For Moving Us From A Room With A Small Double Into One With A Much Larger Bed.  It Was Done With A Good Grace And Promptly.  Our Visit Would Have Been Marred If We Could Not Have Moved.,,,,,
,1025,I Would Have No Hesitation In Recommending Bovey Castle And Cannot Wait To Visit Again!,,,,,
,1028,Please Acknowledge My Previous E Mail And Advise Me Of The Action Taken If Any.  Thank You,,,,,
,1030,See All Previous Comments - I Look Forward To Your Reply.  As You Well Know  You Do Not Get Second Chance To Make A First Impression,,,,,
,1031,There Are A Lot Of Good Things About The Hotel (The Breakfast Was Excellent  The Public Spaces Are Attractive)  It Just Didn't Quite Deliver The Cossetted Experience I Had Hoped To Achieve By Paying That Price.  Maybe Because It Is A Big Hotel  But Was Almost Empty  It Lacked Some Kind Of Personality.,,,,,
,1034,Very Relaxing Break With Almost Too Much To Do. Beautiful Setting  Wonderful Staff And Will Definitely Visit Again  But With My Family Next Time.,,,,,
,1035,See Above No. 23,,,,,
,1036,Choice Of Food In The Bistro Is Very Limited And Not Particularly Good. Breakfast Was Poor  Not As Good As A 4Star Hotel. Plates For Hot Food Were Cold And Bacon Was Cold.,,,,,
,1039,The Hotel Is Beautiful And Luxurious.  Would I Book It Again  I Am Not Sure  But I Have Talked About It To Friends,,,,,
,1040,Absolutely Beautiful Building  Well Cared For.  Generally  A Friendly Atmosphere  Reception Staff Were Excellent.  We Will Return  But Maybe Not To Stay  The Bedroom Was Just Too Hot And Breakfast Service Definitely Needs To Be Better Organised.,,,,,
,1041,I Felt Slightly Uncomfortable Handing Over My Car Keys (Which Included All Of My Keys Including My House Keys) To A Member Of Staff To Park My Car.   The Keys Were Then Passed To Reception To Hold.,,,,,
,1042,It's A Lovely Place To Go But Needs Some Attention. Reception Staff Were Excellent,,,,,
,1043,We Had Contacted You By E-Mail Concerning Our Disappointment.,,,,,
,1047,No,,,,,
,1048,We Had A Totally Relaxing And Enjoyable Visit.  Our Only Complaint Was That We Could Only Stay One Night!  The Wonderful Weather Was The Cherry On The Cake And Showed Off The Beautiful Grounds To Perfection.  Bovey Castle Is A Magical Place And A Delightful Hotel.,,,,,
,1050,We Booked This Room In May 2011 And Secured The Price Of Â£229 Inclusive Of A Full English Breakfast.  On Checking Out Another Â£30 Was Added For Breakfast.  Luckily Enough I Had The Original E Mail With Me To Prove That The Price Was Â£229.  I Did Not Expect The Price To Have Changed.,,,,,
,1053,The Lack Of A Mobile Phone Signal Is A Real Issue Nowadays But May Be Outwith Your Control.,,,,,
,1056,Didn't Know The Service Fee Was Discretionary! Thought It Was A Charge That Needed To Be Paid.,,,,,
,1061,Generally It Was A Very Happy Stay Made So By The Staff Team. I Know We Have Mentioned Quite A Few Negatives Here But This Is Was You Have Requested An Honest And Objective Review.,,,,,
,1064,Probably One Of Coldest Weekends But Hotel And Bedroom Very Cosy And Warm.,,,,,
,1065,The Bird Display Were A Very Enjoyable Inside And Out !!!!,,,,,
,1067,Frederico Is An Excellent Manager A D Guided His Staff Carefully.,,,,,
,1069,Please Ensure That The Chairs In The Bistro Are Regularly Checked To Make Sure That They Are Smooth When We Return I Would Not Like My Wife To Get Another Splinter In Her Hand.,,,,,
,1071,Bovey Castle Is A Beautiful Building In A Stunning Location. As A Hotel It Could Be A Much Better Experience For Guests If The Issues I Have Raised Were To Be Addressed.  Thank You.,,,,,
,1072, I Liked The Receptionists And Porters Outfit  Thought They Were In Keeping With The Castle Image  Loved The Fact That Despite The Weather The Fires Were Kept Stoked And Made That Home Feeling More Because Of The Weather.  I Hope You Do Not Loose This Ambience   Well Done.  In A Very Slick World It Is Nice To See Something Different...  Best Wishes  For The Future We Will See You Again With The Dog Next Time.,,,,,
,1073,We Were Four Generations Of Our Family And We All Enjoyed Our Stay Immensely,,,,,
,1075,We Would Thoroughly Recommend This Hotel And Look Forward To A Future Visit.,,,,,
,1076,We Had A Problem Working The Tv. Although Iplayer Was Shown As Being Available We Could Not Access It.,,,,,
,1079,My Wife And I Thought That The Entrance Stairway (Red) Carpet To Our Room (33) Was In A Poor Condition And Not At All In Keeping With The Rest Of The Hotel Floor Coverings . When We Were Escorted To Our Room Our First Impression Was  As We Were Travelzoo Clients  That This Might Be A 'Downgraded' Area. Rw,,,,,
,1083,All The Best For The Future And We Hope To Return Soon.,,,,,
,1085,Our Departure Was Delayed As My Car Was Closely Surrounded By Others One Of Which Had To Moved By Staff So I Could Drive Out Safely Without Causing Any Damage.  Rows Of Cars Should Be Further Apart.,,,,,
,1086,Very Much Liked The Fact That You Provided Magnifying Glasses For The Swimming Pool Door Code! And Also Magnifying Glasses In The Bedroom - Helps People Of A Certain Age!,,,,,
,1089,Despite My Comments Above Staff Very Friendly And Helpful When We Found Them And Asked For Anything. Only Declined To Pay Discretionary Service Charge For Afternoon Tea.,,,,,
,1090,We Were Disappointed That The Golf Shop Insisted That We Pay For Playing Only 4 Holes Of The Course - Before We Teed Off The Pro Shop Told Us ( At 1Pm )  That The Forecast Was For Rain At 4Pm - In The Event We Had Torrential Rain By 2Pm And As The Greens Were Flooding Had To Abandon The Round,,,,,
,1091,Had A Massage Treatment In The Spa - Fabulous.  Girls Friendly And Very Good Quality Of Treatment.,,,,,
,1092,Back To Dining Again I Am Afraid. We Looked At Eating In The Bistro But I Have To Say It Looked Very Canteenish. I Appreciate This May Be For Use By Golfers But The Two Dining Venues You Offer Are Too Extreme And Maybe Consideration Be Given To A Venue Within A Venue For Evening Meals In The Bistro.,,,,,
,1093,As The Hotel Did Not Appear To Be Busy We Could Not Understand Why A Better Room Was Not Available. We Are Not The Type To Complain But Since Coming Home We Have Reviewed Our Feeling And Which Are Reflected In This Survey  It Was A Disapointing Wedding Anniversary.  We Should Emphasise We Had No Complaints With Any Of The Staff.,,,,,
,1095,We Were Not Met On Arrival As We Expected But Proceded To Reception With Our Bags. I Opted To Park My Car Myself And Retain My Keys. Returning The Second Day And Parking In The Area Through The Mews  On Entering The Hotel Was Asked To Had Over My Car Key 'For Safety Reasons'. We Declined To Do So As We Said We Had Not Been Asked To Do So On The Previous Day. The Same Porter Then Proceded To Give Us The Wrong Room Key Only Discovered When We Tried It In Our Door Lock.,,,,,
,1096,On Booking  I Had Advised That We Were Celebrating My Wife's Birthday.  This Was Followed Up Very Well By All The Reception Staff On Arrival And  Indeed  By The Manager Himself  Who Presented Us With Two Glasses Of Champagne Before Dinner - Thank You!,,,,,
,1097,The Falconry Display Was A Real Treat.,,,,,
,1098,A Disappointing Visit Made More Stressful By Having  To Complain About Issues That Should Not Have Arisen In The First Place.,,,,,
,1099,The Hotel Was Very Welcoming To Our 2 Year Old Grandaughter. All The Staff Were Very Friendly And Welcoming To Her.,,,,,
,1100,Thanks For A Lovely Stay      We Were With The Anning Party,,,,,
,1103,We Enjoyed Our Stay And Will Return,,,,,
,1104,On Arrival There Was A Wedding In The Restaurant And I Asked The Barman Where We Would Be Eating That Evening As I Didn't Realise The Room Would Be Cleared By Then. He Said That He Didn't Know And Would Find Some-One Who Did. Our Breakfast Order Was Forgotten And We Had To Wait 50 Mins Without An Apology Just 'It Won't Be A Minute' Response When We Wondered Where It Was. Our Final Bill Included Another Room's Dinner Drinks And The Explanation Was That The Other Couple Had Sat On Our Table. But We Hadn't Booked To Eat In The Restaurant That Evening. The Fresh Milk In The Fridge Was A Nice Touch Even If It Was Only For One Of The 2 Days.,,,,,
,1105,No,,,,,
,1106,When We Went To Leave The Hotel Our Car Was Blocked In By 3 Cars None Of Which Left Their Keys With Reception. We Had To Wait Nearly 45 Mins Until Someone Was Found And Their Car Moved. We Also Felt That Our Car Was Scratched On The Front Bumper  However It Is Impossible To Say Whether This Was Done At The Hotel  Even Though We Hadnt Noticed It Before. The Young Man Was Very Apologetic And Had Tried His Best To Find The Owners Of The Cars As Quickly As He Could. Again We Think This Is Something That Should Not Have Happened.,,,,,
,1107,I Think The Other Problem I Noticed Is Since The Staff Wears So Many Hats  It Makes It Difficult For The Hotel When The Hotel Is Full.  The Golf Shop Needs Some Help When They Do Not Offer Ball Markers  Tee Picks And Other Necessities For The Golfers Who Do Not Bring Their Own Equipment.,,,,,
,1108,No,,,,,
,1109,Your Lovely Staff Need Training On How To Make A Cup Of Tea! It Was Usually Weak And Only Warm,,,,,
,1110,Overall We Enjoyed Our Stay And The Staff Were All Very Pleasant And Helpful. The Bedrooms However Do Need A Lot Of Money Spending On Them.,,,,,
,1114,Not Sure About The Service Charge. I Understand Why You Have Done It - Some People Are Incredibly Mean/Unaware. But It Does Make It Feel Rather Like A Cruise Ship And Could Lead To Abuse.,,,,,
,1118,Wonderful!,,,,,
,1119,My Husband Really Enjoyed The Golf. He Said It Was A Good Course Although The Greens Needed Some Attention.,,,,,
,1120,Greatly Enjoyed The Falconry Display,,,,,
,1122,Stunning Location - And Scenery Was Spectacular. The Venue Is Very Impressive  But It Is Overpriced As The House Needs Redecorating  And Whilst The Staff Were Very Courteous  The Service Was Dreadful. Outrageously Expensive - 5 Star Prices For A 3 Star Experience.   ,,,,,
,1123, We Were Told Prior To Our Visit  Only That You Would Not Be Too Busy. However It Turned Out That You Had Hardly Any Guests Apart From Ourselves  Resulting With Feeling Of Being Largely Alone And The Edwardian Dining Room Closed Throughout  With A Waiter Who Was Bored And Listening In To Our Conversations In A Small  Dining Room.,,,,,
,1124,A Wonderful Break,,,,,
,1125,I Was Not Told That The Service Charges Added To The Account Were Discretionary!,,,,,
,1126,Overall Excellent,,,,,
,1127,There Was No Shower Mat In The Bath So The Danger Of Slipping Was High,,,,,
,1131,Sorry The Weather Was Not Better - The Golf Course Looked Very Interesting And Would Have Liked To Play It. We Enjoyed All Of Your Suggestions On Restaurants In The Area.,,,,,
,1132,As This Was A Special Birthday Treat It Truly Lived Up To All My Expectations.,,,,,
,1134,Overall  We Had A Lovely Time But The Attention To Detail Was Lacking On Service.,,,,,
,1139,The View Fro Our Room Was Glorious. Room 14.,,,,,
,1142,All In All A Very Impressive Experience.,,,,,
,1147,No Ladies Magazines,,,,,
,1149,We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Wedding.  It Was A Beautiful Venue And The Staff Were Friendly And Efficient.  Our Only Other Disappointment Was That The Staff Failed To Put The Beautiful Bouquet Of Flowers For Mother-Of The Bride In Water Overnight Which We Thought Would Have Been Automatic.,,,,,
,1150, Cold Plates At Breakfast A No No   But Apart From That 10 Out Of 10,,,,,
,1155,Your Breakfast Service Needs An Overhaul....Nobody Took The Time To Explain That The Menu Was Avaiable Or The Buffet Was There For Those Who Wished To Get On With Things  It Took Long Time For Coffee/Tea/Toast To Arrive..Your Coffee Pot Could Be A Teapot(I Understand This Is A Very Subjective Thing But We Were Not Sure Wether We Had Tea Or Coffee On The Table Until A Teapot Arrived). The Food In The Chafing Dishes Was By And Large Cold To Lukewarm. That Is Unforgivenable. The Toast Was Served On A Dinner Plate. Yes You Need To Pay Attention To Breakfast Service Or It Was A Lacadaiscal Day. Bovey Castle Shouldn't Have Days Like That So Breakfast Still Needs Attention.Sorry But You Did Ask For Comments. Your Stall Were All Very Nice So You Got Away With It.....This Time.  I Also Feel That You Could Make Your Guest Questionaire Easier  You Say It Will Take 10 Minutes. This Because There Is Such A Wait Between Pages......I Am Sorry If I Appear To Be A Bit Pedantic But I Really Want Bovey Castle To Be At The Top Of The Tree And Only Attention To Detail Will Get You There.     ,,,,,
,1156,My Husband And I Are In Our Eighties And We Found That The Maroon Rug In Front Of The Fire In The Bar Room Was Rather Flimsy And Therefore Crumpled Causing Us To Almost Trip. We Had To Walk On It To Get From One Room To Another As There Were A Lot Of People In There.  We Didn't Trip But One Could Easily Have Done So. Not A Complaint  Just An Observation.,,,,,
,1157,After The Initial Experience  Everyone Worked Very Hard To Make Us Feel Welcome And At Home.,,,,,
,1160,Don't Stop Doing What You're Doing.,,,,,
,1162,The Hotel Is Becoming Overdue For Refurbishment  And You Are Still Charging Top Dollar. Therefore Poor Value For Money.,,,,,
,1164,Individually All Staff Were Kind And As Helpful As They Could Be  But It Was Clear There Were New Members Of The Team.  I Wouldn't Describe It As A Slick Operation.  I Was Very Irritated By The Hefty Automatic Service Charge On Every Food Or Drink Transaction.  I Agreed To Pay Because I Guessed The Staff Needed The Boost.  But It Added An Unexpected Charge To An Already Pricey Break.  At These Prices There Needs To Be A More Professional And Slick Operation.,,,,,
,1165,We Were Three Generations Of The Family And Everyone Enjoyed It Hugely.,,,,,
,1166,No,,,,,
,1167,Don't Know If Spa Questions Include Swimming Pool And Steam Room Etc/  If So They Were Absolutely Excellent.,,,,,
,1169,Just To Say - Thank You To All The Staff,,,,,
,1173,I Wish I Hadn't Paid The Discretionary Service Charges But I Was Sorry For The Staff And Felt They Shouldn't Suffer For Poor Staffing Levels And Cooking As All The Rest Was Really Good,,,,,
,1175,Again On The Hottest Day Housekeeping Closed Our Windows In The Evening Leaving The Bedroom Stifling And When I Mentioned This To Reception I Was Told That I Should Have Put The 'Do Not Disturb Sign On The Door'. An Apology Would Have Been Appreciated And Also Common Sense From Housekeeping Would Have Gone A Long Way Particulary As It Took So Long To Have A Fan Installed.,,,,,
,1176,Checking Out Was A Problem. We Were 6. Prior To Dinner  As We Were On An Inclusive D B & B Rate We Specifically Asked If There Were Any Guidlines To Ordering From The Alc Menu. We Wre Advised That All Was Included  And We Should Order Anything. The Following Morning  Not Only Was There A Dinner Supplement Of Â£83 Added To Our Bill  But There Was Also An Additional Service Charge Of A Further Â£60+. After Some Discussion These Were Deleted  But Merely Having These Discussions Detracted From Our Overall Experience. Other That That We Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,
,1180,Hope To Visit Again Soon,,,,,
,1184,Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Small Gift Shop To Purchase A Thing Or Two From The Castle,,,,,
,1185,I Regret That I Could Not Be More Positive After The Visit.,,,,,
,1186,We Only Had Breakfast Once As It Was Not Very Satisfactory. My Wife's Order Scrambled Eggs And A Single Fried Egg Was Served. This Was Replaced With The Ordered Scrambled Eggs Which Were Stone Cold. This Was Then Replaced With Hot Scrambled Eggs But By Then The Rest Of The Food Had Become Dry And Tough Due To Being Kept Warm For A Long Time. What Amazed Me Was A The Lack Of An Appology.,,,,,
,1188,Comfortable Luxury Well Done.,,,,,
,1189,Congratulations On Your New Arrival Federico! Sorry We Missed You But After Talking To Donna We Agreed To Try Bovey Again After Our Last Experience And This Time It Was Extremely Good And We'll Probably Come Again For Christmas One Year Soon,,,,,
,1194,The Hotel Looks Tired With Wallpaper Coming Off Or With Small Tears  Paint Scraped Off Skirting And Architrave  Poor Lighting. The Outside Hall Where Rubber Boots Are  I Realize Supposed To Look Old Country Mansion But Frankly Looks Plain Untidy And Diirty. Please Note That I Paid My Bill In Full And Am Not One Of Those People Seeking Discounts By Finding Fault.,,,,,
,1196,Counting The Days (And The Pennies ) Till We Can Come Again,,,,,
,1197,The Lodge Had Several Minor Faults And The Provsions To The Bathrooms Were Not To The Same Standard As Our Stay 2 Years Ago Tv Channel Selection Very Limited.,,,,,
,1202,Was Not Aware That Pets Were Allowed In The Hotel And Bar.  I Am Allergic To Dogs And Cats But Thankfully We Were Leaving By The Time We Saw The Dogs; Otherwise  I Would Not Have Been Able To Stay In The Same Area As Them.,,,,,
,1204,A Wonderful Stay. We Have Never Relaxed In A Hotel As Much As We Did In Bovey Castle. Wonderful,,,,,
,1205,Although A Great Hotel - Felt Was Perhaps A Bit Over Priced,,,,,
,1206,I Had An Enjoyable And Relaxing Weekend And My Wife I Thoroughly Enjoyed The Experience,,,,,
,1209,I Have Nothing But Great Gratitude And Appreciation For Everything So Many People Did For Me During My Stay At Bovey Castle.  The Staff Is The 'Face' Of Bovey ... And The Staff Is Exceptional  Beyond Words.   I Don't Believe The Level Of Genuine Caring And Compassion Would Be Found Anywhere Else In The World.  Bovey Castle Is Unique And I Am Grateful To All And For The Experience.  And A Special Thanks To Lucy And To Federico Who Went Out Of Their Way To Make Sure That Our Stay Was A Positive One.   I Commend You  Federico  For Hiring Such An Outstanding Staff!  Best Wishes Always  Tracy,,,,,
,1212,The Worst Experience Was A Smelly  Overflowing Dog Poo Bin By The Bridge. Unacceptable. Reception Was Notified.  I Missed Or Was Not Made Aware Of Recycling Options.,,,,,
,1215,Ask The Bed Maker To Spend A Few Seconds More Getting The Bedding Flat And The Under Sheet Flat. Getting Into A Bad Bed Is Not So Good. Find A Good Manager To Control The Waiters Better.,,,,,
,1216,Please Keep Up The Excellent Work - We Can't Wait To Come Again Next Year.,,,,,
,1217,Very Enjoyable Short Break.  Thankyou,,,,,
,1218,On Arrival We Were Not Talked Through The Ins @Outs Of The Cooker   Sme Switches Were Hard To Find,,,,,
,1226,We Will Return Shortly So Would Greatly Appreciate If Seasonal Offers Coul Be E Mailed And Next Visit Would Like To Stay In A Suit.,,,,,
,1227,Whilst I Have Mentioned Just Two Points About Our Stay We Still Had A Fantastic Experience And Will Stay With You Again And The Points Raised Are So Easily Put Right. Our Stay Was Memorable For All The Right Reasons And A Hot And Tasty Breakfast Before Our Departure Was Most Welcome And Thank You For That  What A Fantastic Way Of Ending What Proved To Be Such A Great Week You And We Look Forward To Seeing You Again Soon.,,,,,
,1228,A Wonderful Experience All Round. Made My 50Th Birthday Special. Saving Up For A Return Visit!,,,,,
,1230,Thanks To Federico And The Team  We'll Be Back For Hopefully Better Weather.,,,,,
,1231,Great Stay Again - We'll Be Back.,,,,,
,1236,It Was Important To Our Sons That We Had A Fabulous Time On Our Celebratory Birthday Tour Which Lasted A Week  Finishing At Bovey Castle.  You Did Not Disappoint - Thank You So Much.  We Shall Certainly Recommend You To Our Friends And The Rest Of The Family - And We Shall Definitely Return.,,,,,
,1237,A Truly Magnificent Building In A Sensational Setting. Clearly Striving And Delivering Culinary Delights Whilst Offering A Superb Well Balanced Service. You Are  As You Portray To Be. Well Done.,,,,,
,1238,The Price Of 2X Gin And Tonics Was Â£24 Odd - Again This Leaves A Feeling Of Being Exploited Not Cared For And Leaves A Negative Thought Which May Be The Difference Between Returning Or Not. Enjoyed The Indoor Games Selection In The Library - Care Needs To Be Taken With The Backgammon - All The Pieces Weren't There So We Improvised. Great Idea To Have Indoor Pursuits Though - Especially Thinking About Couples Here Though Games For The Family Is Also A Good Idea.,,,,,
,1241,We Will Definitely Be Coming Back; My Husband And I Want To Make It An Annual Visit As A Result Of The Truly Excellent Experience We Had. We Had Such A Wonderful Time  And Still Haven't Stopped Talking About It. Thank You So Much For Giving Us Such A Brilliant Weekend!,,,,,
,1245,The Oak Bar Should Be Staffed At All Times. On A Couple Of Occassions I Would Have Ordered Something If Approached When Sat In The Bar During The Day. Full Staffing Would Also Help With The Security Of All Of Those Lovely Spirit Bottles!,,,,,
,1249,We Ran Out Of Time - It Would Have Been Good To Have Longer.  We Tried The Walk - The Shortest One - We Had Trouble Finding The Path Between Holes 3 And 4 On The Golf Course  And Also The Walk Seemed Tougher And Longer Than We Expected. One Of The Stiles Really Presents Quite A Challenge.  Ok - We Are Both Over 60 And Could Be Fitter  But It Seemed More Of A Challenge Than We Expected. The Cream Tea At The Ring O' Bells Was Huge - With Two Huge Scones Each. We Could Have Made Do With One Such Tea And An Extra Pot Of Tea. Perhaps Put An Extra Sheet In The Booklet To Point This Out.,,,,,
,1250,We Very Much Look Forward To Our Next Visit!,,,,,
,1251,Keep Up The Great Work - We Will Be Back  If You Can Give Us A Good Deal!,,,,,
,1253,All Reception Staff Were Extremely Helpful Last But Not Least Federico Is An Outstanding Manager Who Is Unobstusive Yet Full Of Quiet Humour With 'A Nothing Is Too Much To Please Attitude' Towards Us As  Guests,,,,,
,1255,The Staff Organising The Activities Were Brilliant Too. Ben And Craig Deserve Particular Mention. Friendly And Excellent Trainers Too! The Maintenance Team Were Excellent Too.,,,,,
,1258,Afternoon Tea Was Exceptional. Thoroughly Enjoyed Visit And Will Be Back For Longer Next Time,,,,,
,1259,We Really Enjoyed The Opportunity To Use The Swimming Pool  But Would Add That The Surrounding Tiles Were Rather Slippery.,,,,,
,1260,The Countryside And The Views Are Something Unforgettable For Us. The General Atmosphere Of The Hotel Is Warm  Positive And Friendly And We Will Definitely Come And Stay With You Again. We Will Tell About Your Hotel To Our Friends In Our Country But Also In England As We Have Been Spending Our Holidays In The Uk For 17 Years And We Have Made Quite A Lot Ot Friends There (We Stay In The Same Hotels And Places And We Keep In Touch With Our Friends From England During The Whole Year).,,,,,
,1262,We Live Locally & Would Come To Bovey On A Regular Basis If There Was Some Kind Of 'Locals Loyalty Scheme' Particularly In The Quieter Days / Months Of The Year.  I Would Be Very Interested In Receiving Promotions Direct Rather Than Having To Watch Out For Them On Offer Sites.,,,,,
,1264,Keep It Up.   Using A Lodge Combined With The Hotel And The Fact You Are Dog Friendly Makes Bc A Top Destination For Us Now And I Am Sure For Many Years To Come.,,,,,
,1265,It Was The Very Best Hotel Experiance We Have Ever Had  Thank You For Making Our Stay Special.,,,,,
,1266,Unfortunately  Each Of The Three Breakfasts Were Disappointing In Different Ways. The First Day  I Had A Very Long Fair Hair In My Fried Eggs And On The Sunday  The Buffet Ran Out Of Scrambled Eggs. When More Were Presented  They Were Far Too Runny And Absolutely Stone Cold. The Final Day's Breakfast Was Also Below Standard. Also On All Three Days  We Were Not Supplied With A Toast Rack; When It Was Pointed Out That The Toast Will Be Soggy  We Were Told You Did Not Have Sufficient For Everybody. All In All  The Breakfast Spoiled What Was Otherwise A Perfect Weekend.,,,,,
,1270,Just That We Had A Lovely Stay And To Say Thank You To The Manager For Organising A Cake And Champagne For My Partners 40Th Birthday  Thank You X,,,,,
,1272,Only Thank You For Making Our Stay Very Special  And We Hope To See You Again Soon.,,,,,
,1274,We Loved It And Will Be Returning!,,,,,
,1275,Enjoyed Our Stay Very Much.,,,,,
,1276,A Wonderful Weekend  Would Loved To Have Stayed Longer. The Golf Facilities Were Very Good  All Members Of Staff Were Friendly & Helpful. Really Great To See The Duty Manager Constantly Wondering Around Making Sure All Guests Were Happy  Felt Like All Staff Really Cared And Took Pride In Working At Bovey Castle. Thank You.,,,,,
,1278,Though I Appreciate There Is A Balance To Be Struck Finding Al Public Rooms Less The Bar Reserved For Private Functions On Saturday Lunchtime/Afternoon Lessened My Feeling Of Being Welcome As A Guest.,,,,,
,1280,Cannot Wait To Come Back  This Time For Longer So We Can Enjoy All The Facilities On Offer.,,,,,
,1281,I Do Love Bovey Castle!,,,,,
,1282,We Had A Fantastic Time And Will Return,,,,,
,1283,A Really Small Thing. The Ladies Loo Downstairs Has A Problem With The Drains And Doesn't Smell Great. If The Problem Can't Be Fixed It Would Really Benefit From Perfumed Oils To Improve The Smell. In An Ideal World Extra Loos Nearer The Restaurant/Bar Would Be Great. It Wasn't A Problem For Us But I Can Imagine It Being Difficult For Older Guests.,,,,,
,1286,Lovely Relaxing Hotel Would Definately Come Back. Food Good Atmosphere Relaxed And Very Welcoming,,,,,
,1288,I Found Bovey Castle To Be A Very Nice Weekend Away  The Only Let Down Was The Food I Have Mentioned And The Bedroom. Apart From Those Little Niggles It Was Very Relaxing.,,,,,
,1289,Beautiful Venue  Food And Outstanding Staff. Not One Area I Could Find Any Fault. A Truly Enjoyable Experience Even Though We Were Working. I Will Defintely Be Returning To Bovey Castle On A Leaisurely Basis And Perhaps Even Through Work.,,,,,
,1292,Overall We Really Enjoyed Our Stay And The Ambience And Food Was Fantastic. However The Price And The End Product Aren't Always Aligned Which Just Takes The Shine Off  Eg Awkward Arrival  Room Position  Average Bathroom  Took 3 Attempts And 20 Mins To Get A Glass Of Wine During Dinner  And Breakfast Was Just Ok. Would Love To Come Again But Return After That Would Depend On The Experience. Close To Faultless But Niggly Bits Just Irked Considering The Cost.,,,,,
,1294,Moan - Service Charge  It Was Not Made Clear If This Was Discretionary.  We Did However Have The Best Break We Have Had In Ages. Thank You!,,,,,
,1296,Having The News Papers In A Bag Hanging On The Door Rather Than Laying On The Floor By The Door Is A Lovely Touch,,,,,
,1297,We Had A Wonderful Stay.  I Had No Issue Paying The Service Charge  I Read And Understand Your Policy  However I Am Still Not Convinced It Is The Right Thing To Do. It Did Put Us Off Dining And Drinking In The Hotel As Much As We Would Have Done  As It Does Give You The Assumption That You Are Going To Be Paying More (Even Though We Would Always Leave A Tip).  I Just Think That It Wears Away A Little Bit Of The Wonderful Atmosphere You Have Created,,,,,
,1300,The Soap In The Cloakrooms Looks Like It Belongs In A Hospital Not A Luxury Hotel And There Was No Hand Cream. Preference For Gin And Tonic Is Fever Tree Tonic And Not Schwepps.,,,,,
,1301,Cant Wait To Come Back....,,,,,
,1303,Separate Spa Services On Final Bill So They Are Grouped Together... This Would Be Good For Guests Staying Several Days.,,,,,
,1304,Would Love To Return When We Have Saved Up The Pennies  As This Was A Treat To My Wife And Me To Stay Away To Somewhere Luxurious As A Relaxing Retreat Away From The Stresses Of Work!. We Looked At Many Other Hotels But This One Stood Out For Us  And Exceeded Our Expectations. We Have Already Recommend/(Promoted) To Family And Friends  And Will Continue To Do So.,,,,,
,1306,I Stay At A Lot Of Hotels During The Year But Federico Is Probably The Only Hotel Manager I Felt I Had Actually Come To Know During My Stay. His Energy And Enthusiasm For The Program And His  Guests Is Quite Amazing. Worth Coming Again To See The Plum Pudding Outfit If Nothing Else!,,,,,
,1307,Unfortunately I Was Very Sick During The Night Of Our Stay I Don't Know If Of Was Something I Had Eaten I Had The Wild Mushroom Risotto! We Left Without Breakfast Which Was A Shame As We Had A Flurry Of Snow During The Night And Having Breakfast And Looking At A Picture Postcard View Would Have Been Perfect!,,,,,
,1311,Even Though 'Travelzoo' Bookers We Were Made To Feel As Welcome As I'm Sure Your Normal Guests Are - Thank You  Hope To Return Soon!,,,,,
,1313,Will Return,,,,,
,1314,Bovey Castle Is Not Just A 5 Star Hotel. It Provides First Class Service  Which Is A Rarity In Today's Hospitality Industry. Despite The Long Drive From Cambridgeshire  We Will Definitely Be Returning In The Very Near Future.,,,,,
,1315,When We Were Due To Leave We Packed Up All Our Stuff And Left It In The Room To Be Taken Downstairs To The Car.  Unfortunately The Chap Who Took All Our Stuff To The Car Left My Dogs Food And Emma Bridgewater Bowl In The Room Which Had Been Packed In A Container.  I Called Bovey Castle As Soon As I Got To My Parents Home And They Promised To Send It First Class But It Still Hasn't Arrived.  Unfortunately The Food Is Worth About Â£30 And The Bowl Around Â£40 As It Is Personalised With Sam's Name On It.  I Will Call Later To Check When It Was Sent.,,,,,
,1316,Your Marketing Is Superb  The Offer We Took Up Was A Good One But It Just Seemed To Us That The Whole Experience Didn't Quite Flow - Perhaps You Where All Exhausted After Christmas / New Year But It Just Seemed That Something Was Lacking - The Spring In The Step  The One Intangible Thing That Makes The Difference Between Ok And Exceptional,,,,,
,1318,The Breakfast Service Was The Weakest Element Of The Hotels Facilities.,,,,,
,1319,Parking. Why As A Resident  Do I Have To Park/Move My Car 200 Hundred Yds Away To Accommadate Someone Who Is Only There For The Day. When I Am Booked In For Five Days. This Is A Very Sore Point  As I Spoke To Other Residents About This Subject And They All Agreed.,,,,,
,1320,The Service Charge Has To Go. We Waited 25 Mins To Check Out Due To The 7 People In Front Of Us Taking Issue With It. Definitely Not A Coincidence. We Paid The Restaurant Service Charge As It Was Well Deserved  But We Would Not Have Paid For Accommodation Or Maid Service.,,,,,
,1322,A Truly Wonderful Couple Of Days - We Will Be Back!,,,,,
,1323,Well Done,,,,,
,1324,Look Forward To The Next Wedding  Keep Us Up To Date With The Next One So We Can Gate Crash !! Lol,,,,,
,1325,Many Thanks To All Again  We Had A Lovely Stay And It Was The Perfect Treat For My Mums Birthday.,,,,,
,1326,Excellent! We Got Engaged Here And Will Return As Bovey Castle Is Now Extremely Special To Us Creating A Life Long Memeory And Unforgettable Experience,,,,,
,1327,I Travel To And Stay In A Lot Of Hotels; Bovey Castle Was Exceptional. The Building And Setting Is Superb And Backed By A Fantastic Team. In My Opinion  One Of The Best Hotels In The Uk.,,,,,
,1331,Superb!,,,,,
,1334,Thank You Very Much And We Will See You Again,,,,,
,1335,Following On From Only Negative Score Above Re: Checkout/Billing - This Was As A Result Of The Itemised Breakdown - It's Quite Confusing With All Of The Itemised Service Charges. Plus We Had Other People's Drinks On Our Bill - Whom We Were Asked If We Knew What Their Name Was! It Wasn't A Problem - Just A Bit Of An Unfortunate End.,,,,,
,1337,None,,,,,
,1338,All The Facilities  Accomodation And Staff Were Excellent And Made The Stay Very Memorable - Thank You.,,,,,
,1340,I Thought The Falconry Display Was Excellent As I Did Not Realise This Event Was On Until I Glanced Out The Window At Breakfast.,,,,,
,1343,Had A Wonderful Stay.  Really Enjoyed The Grounds  The Bird Display And The Room Was Fabulous For Space And Layout.  Very Comfortable Bed And Accommodation Overall.,,,,,
,1346,A Very Relaxing And Comfortable Stay.  Great Location And (Luckily) Fabulous Weather For Us.  We Loved The Homely Yet Professional Ambience  Friendly Staff And Pleasant Guests.  Even Though We Didn't Have Our Son With Us We Know That He Would Love To Stay At Bovey Castle And Enjoy All The Activities/Facilities.  We Both Enjoyed An Extremely Relaxing And Refreshing 24 Hours.  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. Would Definitely Want To Return (Particularly If More Deals Either Local Or Travelzoo Are On Offer).  Just One Small Criticism There Were Children In The Pool After 5.30 Pm (In Fact At 6.30 Pm And Later) Which Did Detract From Our Enjoyment  Especially As We Didn't Bring Our Own Child!,,,,,
,1348,Please Keep A Eye On The Dress Code In Edwardian  One Guy Had A Round Neck Jumper On.,,,,,
,1349,Again We Hope To Return Please Keep Me On Your Mailing List,,,,,
,1350,Only To Say That This Is Our Third Visit To Your Lovely Hotel  And Once Again It Has Been A Delight. We Have Tried To Make It Our Annual Treat And Something To Look Forward To. The Only Downside Of Our Stay Is Leaving!,,,,,
,1353,Thank You For An Exceptionally Enjoyable Stay At A Very Special Place.,,,,,
,1354,Thank You For A Wonderful Stay. David And Minna,,,,,
,1356,Is It Vital To Have Piped Music In The Bistro. If So  Perhaps It Could Be At A Sound Level Less Intrusive.,,,,,
,1357,It Was A Shame That We Had Booked For Archery And Rifle Shooting But The Rifle Shooting Was Cancelled Without Our Knowledge  We Were Also Charged For This Activity On Our Invoice  I Did Query This And Â£10.00 Per Person Was Deducted Apart From That My Wife And I Had A Famulous Time And We Will Definately Be Returning In The Near Future.,,,,,
,1358,Look Forward To Coming Back- An Excellent Break- I Wish We Had Stayed Longer Than The One Night - First Class,,,,,
,1360,The Only Issue I Would Like To Bring To Your Attention Is That Of The Children's Wooden Climbing Frame. It Was Easy For The Children To Get To And They Would Have Loved To Play On It  But Unfortunately We Found This To Be Very Unsafe And Could Easily See One Of Them Falling And Seriously Hurting Themselves. There Was No Guard To Stop Them Falling Off The Edge On The Bridge Part To Get To The Slide. It Wasn't A Big Problem To Us  But As The Weather Starts To Improve And Children Start To Want To Play Out Side More  That Climbing Frame Is An Accident Waiting To Happen.  Well Worth In Investing In A New One We Think.,,,,,
,1361,Looking Forward To A Return Visit.,,,,,
,1362,Some Of The Whiskey Was Very Expensive (2 Doubles Of One Whiskey Would Buy The Bottle Outside The Hotel).,,,,,
,1363,Due To The Poor Mobile Phone Reception At Bovey Castle  I Would Have Expected Internet Access To Be Complimentary For Guests Staying In Suites. Why Is There No Background Music At Breakfast  But There Is For Dinner In The Edwardian Restaurant?,,,,,
,1365,Keep Up The Good Work -  A Lovely Little Haven.,,,,,
,1366,When We Came To Check Out We Found That The Hotel Was Closing As Audi Were Hiring The Entire Venue For The Following Three Days. We Had Planned To Stay For Most Of Sunday But This Was Not Possible. I Would Have Appreciated A Call Or E-Mail Prior To Us Arriving Just Letting Us Know That This Was Happening As We Had Booked Several Months In Advance And This Brought Our Visit O A Premature End. That Said We Loved Every Minute And Can't Wait To Come Back.,,,,,
,1367,I Am Dying To Come Back Just Hope I Could Have A Quieter Room Next Time As I Am Sensitive To Noise (Thats Just Me  My Husband Slept Like A Baby) I Loved Your Steam Room In Particular And The View From The Pool. The Baby Owl Was Gorgeous And The Pick Up Service From The Ring Of The Bells Was A Real Help. Thanks For A Memorable Stay Mr Aresti :D,,,,,
,1368,I Really Enjoyed It And I Hope To Come Back For Christmas Someday,,,,,
,1369,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay.  My Husband And His Friends Also Enjoyed The Golf.,,,,,
,1370,Please Improve The Kitchen And Let Us Know And We'll Be Back...........!,,,,,
,1371,Please My Thanks To The Hotel Manager He Was Very Kind,,,,,
,1372,Whilst I Was Staying On A Liesure Break The Lack Of Mobile Phone Coverage Was Not A Particular Issue  However It Would Have Been Frustrating If On Business.,,,,,
,1374,This Was Our Silver Wedding Anniversary Celebration And You All Made It Very Special For Us  From Start To Finish.  We Had A Thoroughly Enjoyable Weekend And Really Couldn't Fault Anything.  You Clearly Have Very High Standards To Which All The Staff Aspire And It Is Obvious That Everyone Wants To Do The Very Best They Can For Your Guests.  It Was A Wonderful And Memorable Weekend - Thank You All So  Much.  We Definitely Hope To Return.,,,,,
,1376,Overall 10/10,,,,,
,1378,It Was My Wife's 50Th Birthday Treat And Our Four Day Stay Was A Wonderful Experience. Many Thanks To Everyone Who Helped Make Our Stay At Bovey Castle A Memorable One.  Keith & Marion Boughton,,,,,
,1379,We Have Stayed At Bovey Castle (The Manor House) Many Times Over The Years And Love The Building And Location. Where The Old Manor House Hotel Was A Bit Tired  It Had Lots Of Charm And Was Good Value. When It Was Reincarnated As Bovey Castle  Standards Were Very High As To Be Expected For The Price. However  We Feel Standards Of Service And Food Have Now Slipped  And Carpets Are Tired. The Carpet On The Smaller Staircase Near The Dining Room Was Threadbare  And There Were Stains In The Upstairs Hallway And In Our Bedroom. This Is Unacceptable In A Hotel At This Price Level.,,,,,
,1380,You Made Our Mini Moon Fantastic And All The Added Extras Were Amazing And You Made Our Stay With You A Very Special One Xxxx,,,,,
,1381,We Are Considering Coming To Stay At New Year 2013 As Our Christmas Was So Great.,,,,,
,1382,The Little Extras Such As Visiting The Ferrets And Chickens  And The Falconry Display Were Excellent And I Really Enjoyed Meeting Beaky!,,,,,
,1383,My Husband And I Experienced The Highest Standard Of Service Levels  The Best In The World; With Special Reference To Federico Aresti And Chris. The Rooms  Breakfast  Pool Area  Fishing And Gardens Were Outstanding And We Are Looking Forward To Visiting Soon Again.,,,,,
,1385,We Found The Quality Of The Buffet Breakfast Below Par. Your Menu Indicated That There Was A Full English Option But This Was Not Offered  Only The Buffet; The Bacon And Sausages Were Somewhat Dry  The Flat Mushroom Was Watery And A Disappointment. We Would Have Preferred A Freshly Cooked Full English With The Black Pudding Etc. Being Woken Up At 6.15Am By A Van Outside And Then The Noise Of The Lift Was Really Unacceptable. If This Was The Paper Delivery Firstly You Should Have Alternative Arrangements For A Better Delivery System  And Staff Should Not Be Using The Lift At This Time. I Have Looked At The Most Recent Trip Advisor Comments  And The One In August 2012 Mentions Something Similar. You Should Really Take Constructive Criticism On Board. Surely Non Urgent Deliveries Can Wait Until After Say 8.00Am.,,,,,
,1387,Even Though It Is A 5 Star Hotel I Do Feel That For One Whiskey And Coke And One Villa And Lemonade Being Priced Over Â£21 Plus A Service Charge Is A Little Excessive. However Being Upgraded From A Castle Room To A Castle Room With Very Was Lovely. For This Reason I Would Be Looking To Stay With You Again As I Felt I Was Looked After.,,,,,
,1388,Keep Up The Good Work And We Will Look Forward To Seeing You Again.,,,,,
,1389,I Can't Wait To Come Back.,,,,,
,1390,Did Not Expect A Service Charge To Be Put On The Room Rate,,,,,
,1392,Everything Was First Class But The Food Let Our Stay Down A Bit . Can Not Believe Somewhere So Grand Was Let Down By The Food .,,,,,
,1393,Let Us Know When You Have Special Offers!  Would Love To Bring Family & Friends Next New Year 2014.  Fabulous That You Are Not Dog Tolerant But Truly Dog Friendly - Thank You For A Wonderful Experience.,,,,,
,1396,The Carpets In Common Parts Need Changing In Quite A Few Places,,,,,
,1403,We Would Definitely Like To Come Back With Our Children As They Would Love The Whole Experience.,,,,,
,1406,My Wife And I Like To Stay In Hotels Of Distinction  But It's The Staff And Level Of Service That Make Your Experience Truly Memorable. Bovey Castle Has A Relaxed & Elegant Feel  Where You Are Made To Feel At Home And At The Same Time Part Of Something Special. It's An Indulgence To Be Repeated.  I Have And Will Continue To Recommend Bovey Castle To Family  Friends And Colleagues  And Look Forward To Returning.,,,,,
,1410,Only To Say That This Was Our Fourth Visit  And As Ever Was A Delight. We Could Only Stay For One Night Unfortunately But We Will Be Back Again At Christmas - Something To Look Forward To!,,,,,
,1411,Frederico Is A Great Hands On Manager And A Wonderful Host.,,,,,
,1412,We Had A Few Problems With Our Activities  But You Look After Us One Way Or The Other And We Thank You And All Your Staff For That. We Will Remember That.,,,,,
,1414,Only To Thank You Personally Federico For The Provision Of Such A Comprehensively  English Facility. May Your Success's Continue,,,,,
,1415,Thank You For A Lovely Stay!,,,,,
,1416,The African Chap Serving Dinner Was Absolutely Lovely - Apologies I Did Ask His Name But Have Forgotten It Nothing Was Too Much.,,,,,
,1419,I Was Not Aware How 'Dog Friendly' You Are Which Will Be Useful For Future Reference.  I Also Had No Idea Before Arrival Of The Mobile Phone Limitations Which Would Have Presented A Huge Problem Had My Husband Been Staying. The Staff Tweed Uniform Is Delightful And Very Fitting With The Environment.  The Daily Falconry Presentations Were Excellent And The Golf Buggy Extremely Useful And Fun. We Had Some Good Outings Which I Would Recommend:  The Dartington Glass Factory At Torrington; Agatha Christie's House 'Greenway'; And The Beautiful Village Of Dunsford With Teas In The Walled Garden.,,,,,
,1423,I Look Forward To Staying With You Again In The Future.,,,,,
,1426,We Are Very Much Looking Forward To Coming Back To Relax And Unwind Again!,,,,,
,1427,We Visited As A Treat For Our Friend's 60Th Birthday  Overall A Fantastic Stay And She Loved It. A Lovely Experience And Very Much Enjoyed The Falconery Display And Robert's Dry Sense Of Humour.,,,,,
,1428,We Both Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Five Days With Your Team At Bovey And You Can Be Very Proud Of The Offering. It Was Very Nice Of You To Introduce Yourself To My Wife And I As We Were Leaving On Thursday And We Both Hoped You Did Well At The Awards In London You Explained You Had Attended Earlier This Week.,,,,,
,1429,The Play Barn Is A Great Extra Facility,,,,,
,1430,I Like The Service Charge With Everything As It Saves Mucking About With Change And Working Out When  Where And How Much To Tip Who   It Was Quite Clear In My Mind It Was There And Optional.,,,,,
,1432,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay,,,,,
,1433,We Have Not Yet Received Our Bill As There Was No One Available At Reception When We Left At 6.30Am And It Has Not Yet Been Emailed To Me.,,,,,
,1434,I Would Like A Reply To These Matters If Possible. Also I Have Stayed In Many Hotels On A Special Occasion Before And When The Hotel Know Of This It Is Usually Acknowledged. When I Made The Booking I Was Asked If It Was A Special Occasion  I Informed The Team It Was & Totally Overlooked When I Was There.,,,,,
,1435,The Service Charge Is Not Appropriate  Especially Given The Poor Levels Of Service In The Lounge And Grill. In Our 10 Day Stay With You  We Were Only Asked To Sign For Things Twice (Spa & One Occasion In The Grill) And Therefore At The End Of A 10 Day Stay  Were Not Able To Say Whether Or Not Each Entry On The Bill Was Correct. Also  Its Very Difficult (& Uncomfortable) To Ask The Member Of Staff Who Is Serving You To Remove A Service Charge From The Bill When You Sign For It So The Method Guests Use To Tip Staff Needs To Be Revisited. In The Uk It Is Very Unusual To Tip For Drinks At The Bar Or For Childcare So I Feel That Service Charges Should Be Removed In These Areas - You Charge Enough  So You Should Be Able To Properly Remunerate Your Staff Without Asking The Guests To Pay More.,,,,,
,1436,We Will Almost Certainly Return Again  But Would Like To Be Made Aware If The Room Was On Second Floor,,,,,
,1440,This Was A 40Th Birthday Celebration For The Wife. So Disappointing About The Meal That We Didn't Bother With A Sweet Or Coffee. Tarnished The Evening & Very Disappointed.,,,,,
,1441,I Will Return Time And Time Again.  The Staff Are Amazing And Facilities Relaxing.  The Setting Is Stunning And The Entire Experience Is On Of Absolute Luxury. Thank You Fed  You Personally Make The Entire Experience Magical.,,,,,
,1442,I Would Like To Thank Every One For Making Our Stay So Enjoyable,,,,,
,1443,Overall Fantastic Stay And We Would Like This To Become A Yearly Trip. The Pool Was Amazing And Seating Area Very Comfortable And Restful,,,,,
,1444,Ladies Changing Room For The Pool Is Always Freezing! Also Unacceptable Level Of Black Mould Around The Shower Stalls. Sorry But David The Mature Driver Is Getting On The Verge Of Being Grumpy Old Man - Moaning About Tourists And The Traffic Doesn't Sit Well When You're Paying Â£150 For Him To Show You The Sites!,,,,,
,1446,Wonderful Experience Thank You All,,,,,
,1447,We Would Love To Visit Again So Please Keep Us Posted About Any Special Events/Offers.,,,,,
,1448,We Had The Impression That Hotel Manager Makes Much More Than His Tasks Would Require And Works With Passion. Probably This Is The Reason Why Everything Is Fine.,,,,,
,1449,We Felt The Hotel Managed To Achieve The Feeling Of Being Somewhere Special Yet At Ease. The Staff Were Really Very Good And Were So Good With Our Son  Making Him Feel Special Too. He Says 'I Loved Staying At The Castle!' He Was Particularly Delighted With The Lego Room Service Menu  Which Was Great For Us Too As We Didn't Have To Bring Lots Of His Toys With Us!,,,,,
,1451,I Will Be Returning In A Few Years To See How Things Are. The Setting Is Undoubtably Beautiful And The Rooms Are Nice In Decor. Just A Few Issues That Need Addressing And It Wouldn't Take Much To Make This A 1St Class Resort In All Ways.,,,,,
,1452,We Had A Fantastic Time At Bovey And This Was Due To The Staff And Excellent Management  Thank You. We Look Forward To Returning For This Nye Celebrations.,,,,,
,1454,We Had An Excellent Stay And Our Only Regret Was That It Was For 2 Days!,,,,,
,1455,Yes Your Web Site Doesn't Do You Justice . I Told Friends About It And When I Tried Showing Them On The Internet There Weren't Many Pictures Of The Inside. Also My Friends Daughter Is Getting Married And When We Looked Up The E Pictures It Showed One Room   One Table Laid Up And The Bride In The Grounds . Luckily I Showed Them All The Pictures On My Camera.,,,,,
,1456,As Always All Staff Were Very Attentive & Friendly & Service Was Great.,,,,,
,1457,Good - Attitude Towards Dogs And Children - It All Seemed To Work Very Well.  Think The Grounds Are Stunning.  You Could Do With Umbrellas At Outdoor Tables As Sitting Eating In Sun Was Pretty Unbearable But Couldn't Eat Inside With Dog.  Service  Whilst Pleasant Was Patchy And Not Nearly As Efficient As I Would Have Expected In Both Restaurants And Bar,,,,,
,1460,Federico Was Superb. A Gentleman.,,,,,
,1462,Felt Service Charges Should Be Incorporated In Room/Meal Cost. Gratuities Were Deserved But Having An Additional Â£50 On The Bill Was A Hard Pill To Swallow,,,,,
,1463,We Enjoyed Our Stay At Bovey Even With The Problems With The Smoke Detector. It Would Have Gone Even Better If This Had Been Resolved Or We Had Been Moved When The Problem As Identified. As It Turned Out Sleep Was Disturbed For Both Nights.,,,,,
,1464,We Would Love To Come And Stay Again - The Only Reason I Answered 'Maybe' To The Question Of Whether We Would Return Is Because I Don't Know Whether We'll Ever Be Able To Afford It!  Please Do A Travelzoo Deal Again So That We Can Come Back! We Really Enjoyed The Falconry Display And It Was Lovely To Be Able To Spend Time Sitting By The Fire And Reading In The Library.  All The Lounge Areas Were So Beautiful And Comfortable.,,,,,
,1468,We Were Charged For A Meal In The Bistro On 25/11/12 Which Should Have Been Included In Our Package . As Soon As We Mentioned This It Was Rectified Immediately And Satisfactorily.,,,,,
,1473,I Must Just Mention The Grounds Here...The Gardeners Are Always Rather The Unsung Hero's Of The Hotel World I Feel  So Yours Need A Mention! We Were Fortunate Enough To Meet Your Head Gardener Who (Although Extremely Busy) Was Happy To Chat And Explain Some Of The Workings And New Plans For The Splendid Grounds. They Are Extremely Beautiful And It Is Obvious That Hours And Hours Of Love And Hard Work Go Into Keeping Them Looking So Naturally Beautiful. Lastly Your Amazing Falconer ...What A Splendid Man  A Real Talent  With His Birds And His Performance.,,,,,
,1476,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay At Bovey Castle; The Staff Were Extremely Warm  Friendly And Professional.  Despite A Few Issues The Bedroom Was Extremely Comfortable And Of A Good Size  One Issue I Didnâ€™T Mention Previously Is That The Latch On The Tea Box Was Broken  Although A Minor Issue I Wouldnâ€™T Expect It From A 5* Hotel. Our Highlight Of The Trip Was Relaxing In The Adam Room After Dinner  It Was Incredibly Relaxing And Extremely Homely With The Roaring Fire. On Our Way Back To London We Stayed At Chetwon Glen Which Although Flawless Was Not As Warm And Homely As Bovey Castle. We Would Definitely Return To Bovey Castle But We Will Probably Wait Until It Has Received The Investment It Needs. ,,,,,
,1477,I Would Recommend (And Have Already Done So) Every To This Lovely Hotel,,,,,
,1479,Our Few Days At Bovey Castle  For Me  Have Revived My Senses And Nourished My Soul. On A Wintery Few Days  To Sit By The Fireplace  Feeling Totally At Home And At Ease  Was Just What I Needed. My Children Are Desperate To Come Back  Having Loved Every Minute Of The Bovey Rangers Timetable  And Even The  Very Quiet Playbarn. The Room Service Lego Is A Genius Idea  And Was The Selling Point To My Two For Sitting In The Car For 3 Hours To Get There.   The Pain On The Wallet Was Not So Pleasant For Our Stay  For Example Paying Out For Each Of These Activities  And Is The Only Reason We Cannot Rush Back There  Although We Would All Love To Spend Some Days Over New Year There. But Thank You To All  For Such A Wonderful Stay. It Has Set Me Up For Winter Now  Banishing Any Blues And Wishes To Hibernate  Instead I'm Going To Embrace Each Moment As I Did On My Magical Walk Through The Woods To North Bovey.,,,,,
,1482,Bathroom Needed A Little Updating. Breakfast Staff And Room Service Staff  Reception As Well Were Very Helpful. We Left A Â£40 Cash Tip On Top Of The Discretionary Service Charge For Them.,,,,,
,1483,Can't Wait To Visit Again!!!,,,,,
,1485,There Are Too Many Service Charges.  The Knocking Pipes Need Addressing.,,,,,
,1486,I Think The Balance Of Country House Hotel Meets Children Friendly  Meets Spa  Is A Good Mix And I Think You Manage These Varying Needs Well. However  I See More And More Adverts To Win Luxury Breaks At Bovey And I Wonder Why There Is A Need To Do This.,,,,,
,1488,See You Soon  Definitely Coming Back.,,,,,
,1490,I Dont Agree With The Discretionary Service Charge Being Put On The Bill And I Heard Many Other Guests Complaining About This. If It Is Put On The Bill It Is Not Actually Discretionary And Should Probably Just Be Added Onto The Cost Of The Food  Services Etc. It Should Be Down To Us If We Leave A Tip!! It Would Have Been Good To Have A Fridge In Our Room But Apart From That And The Slow Service The 2 Nights We Ate In The Bistro And Slightly Tasteless Food We Had A Lovely Time. Thanks ,,,,,
,1492,We Would Love To Come Back With Our Eldest Two Children.  We Are Thinking Of Staying In A Lodge But The Website Doesnt Have Any Photos Or Details Of Accommodation.  Are There Any Brochures?,,,,,
,1494,Brilliant Experience,,,,,
,1496,I Enjoyed Just Relaxing By The Fires The Ease And Beauty Of The Castle Was Enough. Was Booked Into The Bistro At First But Was A Bit Of A Mixed Atmosphere Telly On Music On  Noisy Children So We Switched To The Restaurant. Would Love To Hear A Bit Of Ambiant Music At Breakfast Otherwise The Experience Is A Bit Dull And Not Very Relaxing.,,,,,
,1498,Stayed In One Of The Lodges And Very Surprised That I Was Charged For The Use Of A Barbecue Grill When The Website States 'Outside There Is A Decked Terrace With Outdoor Furniture  Including Gas Barbecues And Steamer Sun Beds'. Also Do Not Expect To Be Charged 20 Pounds For Wifi Access At A Hotel In This Price Bracket. Other Than T Hese Minor Quibbles An Excellent Stay.,,,,,
,1499,Overall Very Satisfied  All Reception Desk Were Very Helpfull.,,,,,
,1501,I Have Wanted To Stay At Bovey Castle Since I Saw It On The Internet. My Husband Booked Us In For 2 Nights As A Birthday Surprise. When You See Something And Have A Great Desire To Go There Sometimes It Does Not Live Up To Your Expectations And You Are Left Disappointed. Not In This Case.It Was Everything I Thought It Would Be And More. Thank You For A Wonderful Experience. Ps The Afternoon Tea Was Absolutely Superb.,,,,,
,1502,The Only Negative Observation (Which We Didn't Point Out At Our Stay  So Aren't Complaining About From A Service Perspective) Was That Our Bedspread And Bed Valance (Room 44) Seemed A Bit 'Grubby'. As If A Dog Had Been On The Bed. Also  Considering The Overall Excellent Standard (And Price Level) Of Bovey Castle  All Beds Should Be At Least King Size  Not Small Double. But Everything Else Was Absolutely Splendid.,,,,,
,1504,Bovey Castle Provided A Wonderful Experience For All Our Family To Celebrate Our Golden Wedding Anniversary And It Is An Occasion We Will All Cherish Forever !  Sorry For The Delay In Returning This Information We Have Only Just Got Back From The Olympics,,,,,
,1510,See You Again Soon!,,,,,
,1511,Thoroughly Enjoy Every Time We Come To Bovey  Thank You Very  Much.,,,,,
,1512,Still Waiting For A Response From Housekeeping About Some Articles Left In Our Lodge.,,,,,
,1513,We Enjoyed The Bovey Very Much.  I Hope To Plan Another Trip To Devon  Maybe Seeing The Coast A Bit.  Thanks Much,,,,,
,1514,The 'Bird Man' Was Very Entertaining. He Should Be A Stand Up Comedian! Very Informative And A Very Nice  'Free' Addition To Our Stay.,,,,,
,1517,We Shall Be Back Again To Stay With You And Have Already Recommended You To Several Friends Who Will Probably Also Come To Visit You.,,,,,
,1518,We Have 'Raved' To Our Family And Friends About Bovey Castle  We Got Married There And Love It. We Were So Pleased To Have Shared This With Friends Who Were Also Impressed. Thank You For A Wonderful Stay  We Shall Return.,,,,,
,1519,Fabulous And Enjoyed Every Moment! Hope To Visit Again And Perhaps Even One Day One Of Our Sons Will Marry There ....!!!!!,,,,,
,1521,No Thank You,,,,,
,1522,Spa Staff Were Particularly Helpful.,,,,,
,1523,Would Like To Thank Bovey Castle For My Prize On Winning The Hello Competion. Fantastic!!,,,,,
,1524,Loved The Quality Of The In-Room Amenities,,,,,
,1526,Given The Fact That Our Group Was Somewhat Outrageous And 'Different' From The General Visitors You Are Welcoming  I Would Like To Acknowledge Your Patience  Professionalism And Willingness To Serve Us. ,,,,,
,1528,Far And Away The Most Impressive And Welcoming Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In - The Staff Are Superb And The Very Definition Of Five Star Service,,,,,
,1530,Thankyou For A Wonderful Weekend.,,,,,
,1534,Breakfast Wasn't Explained To Us On Our First Day. Not A Problem But It Was A Bit Unclear What Was And Wasn't Included In The Room Rate.  Also  On Our First Day We Asked To Have A Sandwich In The Lounge At Lunchtime But Were Told We Couldn't As It Was Only For Pre-Booked Afternoon Teas. We Were Told To Go To The Bistro Which We Couldn't Do As We Had Dogs With Us. It Was Quickly Sorted Out But A Bit Confusing For A Short While.  Our Stay Was Very Enjoyable  We Will Come Back Again And I Will Recommend It To My Customers.,,,,,
,1535,The Problem With The Bill Was Fixed Immediately Someone Had Charged Breakfast To My Room Which Was Wrongly Done But They Corrected It. Overall Still Easy To Check Out,,,,,
,1536,Will And Want To Come Back,,,,,
,1537,Keep Up The Good Work And Don't Change A Thing.,,,,,
,1538,Clay Shooting Was A Lot Of Fun,,,,,
,1539,This Is Our Fifth Time Staying In A Lodge And We Hope To Come Gain Next Year! Thank You For A Lovely Stay.,,,,,
,1542,Overall The Staff And Friendliness And Professionalism Make Staying At Bovey Castle A Real Treat. Thank You And We Look Forward To Staying Again In The Future And Playing Round Of Golf As We Didn't Get A Chance This Time.,,,,,
,1547,The Service Charge Was Not Explained Before The Account Was Presented To Us; We Had No Problem Paying It But Would Have Preferred To Have Had It Explained Beforehand.,,,,,
,1549,As Stated Previously It Was Once Again A Memorable Experience Ensuring That We Will Return Next Spring.,,,,,
,1550,Despite The Slight Hiatus On Our Final Night Which Was Very Regrettable As This Was Our Third Visit To Bovey  The Staff And Their Attention To Detail Is Exemplary.  What I Do Not Agree With Is That The Good Members Of The Team Are Penalised If They Are Let Down By Others Who Still Receive A Discretionary Service Charge. I Am Quite Happy To Pay For The Service And Team Who Provide An Excellent And Faultless Service  Such As The Breakfast Manager And Team In The Edwardian Restaurant Who Leaves You Feeling Extremely Comfortable After Breakfast.,,,,,
,1551,The Turnaround Of The Rooms Seems To Be A Long Time  If Check Out Is 11 And Checkin Is Three That Seems A Long Time To Clean A Room However When We Arrived The Room Was Not Quite Ready We Arrived Around 1545 I Think. We Were Not Kept Waiting And Kept Occupied With A Show Round By The Receptionist.,,,,,
,1552,If It Had Not Been On Secret Escapes We Would Never Have Stayed At The Hotel As We Had Never Heard Of It Before  So  Thank You.,,,,,
,1553,We Will Definitely Book Again  Perhaps For A Little Longer Though.,,,,,
,1554,Look Forward To Returning Soon. I Am An Advocate Of Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,1555,Overall  We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay And Would Definitely Come Back To Bovey,,,,,
,1557,I Loved Every Second Of Our Short Stay...There Was A Wedding Going On At The Same Time But We Were Made To Feel As Equally Welcome And Looked After By All The Staff.  I Felt Very Comfortable And Relaxed Throughout The Whole Of Our Our Stay  And I Hope We Shall Be Lucky Enough To Return One Day,,,,,
,1558,Excellent All Round Experience,,,,,
,1559,Regarding The Billing We Thought That There Could Have Been Clearer Breakdown Of Cost/Expenses. Almost Like An Itemised Bill So You Could Straight Away See What Had Been Spent And Where  Against The Cost Of The Package. Eg For Dinner There Was A Â£45 Per Head Allowance But From The Billing It Was Hard To See Where The Extra Cost Came From Against The Receipt Signed After The Meal.,,,,,
,1560,Needs A Complete Modernisation And Also Bistro Is To Informal And Whilst Beautiful Scenery The Experience Did Not Live Up To The Recommendations And Other Friends Opinions. I Would Definitely Return Once The Place Is Updated And We Are Given A Better Room With Superb Views,,,,,
,1562,A Truly Wonderful Experience,,,,,
,1563,No Thank You,,,,,
,1565,Thank You For A Lovely Stay. I Hope To Sample The Spa Facilities On My Next Stay!,,,,,
,1567,Overall Perfectly Lovely Stay  Kind Staff And Would Be A Delight To Bring My Family And Friends Back. Thank You.,,,,,
,1569,I Found The Discretionary Service Charge To Be A Little Confusing! With All Your Clear And Evident Brand Values  Laying This On At The End Can Leave A Sour Taste In The Mouth Of The Experience (I Run A Marketing/Branding Business So Have Some Knowledge In This) - You Need To Leave All Your Customers Wanting More  Not Leave Them Thinking; What Was That Charge For!? Either Put Your Prices Up To Include The Charge Or Remove It Altogether. Also  And With My Business Head On  Your Website Isn't Up To The Job In Hand. It Represents Half Of The Proposition But Doesn't Convey The Beauty & Luxury I Saw And Experienced At Bovey Castle Plus  And This Is A Much Bigger Problem  Is Not Compatible With Today's Devices (Ipads  Iphones Etc Etc) - I Wasn't Able To Complete My Booking On The Ipad So Ended Up Calling. If It's Of Interest  I Would Love To Get My Art Director To Draw Up A Visual Of What Your Site Could Look Like And Illustrate How Well It Can Work Across All Platforms.. ,,,,,
,1570,We Had Read Some Very Aggressive Reviews On Tripadvizor Before Our Stay So Had Some Apprehensions. We Agreed Unanimously That As Far As We Could Tell Those Reviews Did Not Reflect Our Experience In Any Way And We Ended Up Wondering About The Authors. That Said There Were Some Smidgeons Of Truth In Some Of Them That Related To The Cleanliness As I Have Already Mentioned. We Loved The Place And The Whole Relaxed Friendly Experience Was Better Than We Had Expected. We Expect To Visit Again And Look Forward To That With Anticipation.,,,,,
,1574,No...Wish You All The Best Of Luck,,,,,
,1575,Fredrico  We Would Like To Thank You And Your Staff For Making Our Stay A Memorable One. Particularily The Attention To Detail And Nicities Such As Chilled Champagne On Arrival  And Your Personal Hands On Style With Your Guests.    I Hope One Day We Will Be Able To Return Again  And Bring Our Family With Us.  Regards  Jackie & George Hunt  (Room 6),,,,,
,1579,Slightly Concerned By Teenage Boys Driving Golf Buggies Around Footpaths Un-Supervised  Given That You Are A Family Hotel This Could Be Dangerous.,,,,,
,1580,I Would Like To Stay In One Of The Lodges At Some Point.,,,,,
,1581,Thank You For An Unforgettable Blissful Stay!,,,,,
,1582,Overall It Was A Lovely Stay And We May Very Well Return  The Only Reason I Didn't Rate It Higher Is Because We Had A Direct Contrast With A Superior Venue The Night Before,,,,,
,1585,We Really Hope If The Hotel Is Sold That No Changes Are Made  It Really Is Perfect.,,,,,
,1589,We Will Return Again And Again.,,,,,
,1590,We Were Advised That We Were Not Allowed In Castle On Monday Or Use Facilities Inside Castle Was Not Told This Continued Into Tuesday As Well,,,,,
,1592,The Set-Up For Christmas Was Perfect And In The Truest Traditions Of A British Festive Holiday.  Nothing Tacky  Just Traditional Quality Features Which Combined To Provide A Stunning And Relaxing Atmosphere  Totally Condusive To Putting A Smile Ion Your Face And Feeling Welcome And Relaxed. You Can Only Get This Level Of Service From A Strong Team Of United Staff And That  Above All Else Is What Makes Bovey Work.,,,,,
,1594,Loved It... Hope To Bring My Parents To Experience Bovey Castle Soon!,,,,,
,1596,The Staff Were Excellent And The Way The Discretionary Service Charge Was Added To The Bill At The End Made It So Very Easy  Rather Than Individual Tipping.,,,,,
,1598,Excellent. Would Not Hesitate To Recommend Or To Stay Again.,,,,,
,1601,I Had A Toasted Teacake When We Arrived But The Butter Was Very Cold And Hard To Spread.  Just A Little Thing But So Easy To Get Right.  The Butter At Dinner And For Breakfast Was Soft And Very Spreadable.   The Drinks / Cocktail Menu In The Bar Is Very Badly Punctuated.  This Gives A Very Bad Impression And Is Extremely Irritating.  It Did Not Spoil Our Enjoyment Of The Lovely Cocktails Though!,,,,,
,1602,The Weekend Was Spoilt By The Service On The Sunday Morning At Breakfast  Causing What Should Have Been An Enjoyable Sunday Massage To Be An Uncomfortable Experience. This Was Not Down To The Spa Staff I Hasten To Add   But The Service Received In The Breakfast Room. The Weekend Was Organised By My Partners Boss As A Thank You For All Her And Her Teams Hard Work Throughout The Year. We Were Really Looking Forward To It  As It Is Not Something We'd Be Financially Able To Do. But We Left Disappointed.,,,,,
,1603,None.  A Lovely Experience.,,,,,
,1604,We Very Much Enjoyed Our Stay And Ate In For Every Meal. As We Came For Two Days Golf The Condition Of The Course Was Important And It Was Very Good. We Then Ate In The Bistro And Later Had A Swim Then A Drink And Dinner.Everything Was Excellent Especially The Staff And Of Course The Weather Was Lovely. We Would Have No Hesitation In Recommending Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,1605,When A Member Of Staff Gets Something Wrong  However Senior They May Be They Should Be Prepared To Apologise Rather Than Becoming Offensive And Petty. I Originally Enquired About The New Year Package Back In April 2011 And Was Promised To Be Kept Up To Date As The Package Became Available  Which I Was And Duly Booked And Paid For Same. However Staff Did Not Seem To Be Aware Of The Type Of Booking I Had Made And Then Made Incorrect Assumptions Without Clarifying The Booking. This Caused Needless Hostility Between My Party And A Senior Member Of Bovey Staff. I Find This Inexcusable.,,,,,
,1606,Simply Magical Stay...,,,,,
,1609,The Way You Present Service Charges On The Final Bill Was A Bit Confusing.,,,,,
,1610,Breakfast Was Fantastic,,,,,
,1611,I Asked For A Room With A Bath  When I Ran The Bath The Water Was A Yellow/Brown Colour...Even After Letting The Tap Run For 10 Minutes So I Didn't Want The Bath After That. Shame I Was Really Looking Forward To That After A Long Drive.,,,,,
,1613,We Absolutely Love Bovey And This Is Our 4Th Visit. Twice In The Hotel And Twice In The Lodges. I Must Say This Time We Both Felt That It Seemed A Little Tired And That The Extra Special Feeling You Get When Going To Bovey Just Wasn't There. The Room Wasn't As Good As Expected For The Upgrade  It Was Very Noisy Due To The Cars All Being Moved Early One Morning  The Dinner Was Very Disappointing  The Spa Treatment Booked Incorrectly And Again Noisy. Lastly The Vegetarian Breakfast - There Weren't Any Veggie Sausages And I Was Offered Hash Browns Instead When It Already Came With Potatoes? I Also Think We May Have Been Overcharged For A Bottle Of Wine By Quite A Lot. I Was Going To Write To You About All Of The Above As We Were Disappointed. We Love Bovey And We Were Hoping To Always Visit Each Year For Our Birthdays In October. I Would Hate If It Went Downhill. Hopefully We Were Just Unlucky With All The Things That Happened This Trip. I Hope To Put These Comments In A Letter As Well.,,,,,
,1615,Can't Wait To Return!,,,,,
,1618,Thank You To All Of You For A Wonderful Weekend. It Was Great To Find Somewhere In This Country Where You Can Experience The Service Our Foreign Counter Parts Have Mastered So Well And Where We In The Uk Seem To Often Struggle To Provide. Thankyou Again Cannot Wait For A Return Stay From Tony And Fiona,,,,,
,1620,Housekeeping Seems Better Than Catering,,,,,
,1621,Too Much Service Charge!,,,,,
,1622,As We Married At Bovey Castle 4Yrs Ago It Is Obviously Very Special To Us And We Returned For Our 1St Wedding Anniversary But Have Been Uncle To Visit Again Until Now 3Yrs Later And It Was Fantastic To Return And For It To Feel As Welcoming And Special As It Did When We Were Married. We Also Really Appreciated The Relaxed Atmosphere As We Bought Our 3Yr Old Son Who Loved His Stay  Especially The Animals And Has Already Asked When We Are Going Again! We Can't Praise Federico And The Whole Team Enough And Look Forward To Our Next Visit.,,,,,
,1624,Would Have Enjoyed The Stay Had I Been Able To Relax In The Room/Get A Good Nights Sleep If The Room Had Been At A Sensible Temperature. Room 3 If You Are Going To Take What We Are Saying For Future Use,,,,,
,1625,Did The Falcon Come Back?,,,,,
,1626,I Thought The Dog Bed  Dog Bowl And Treats In Our Room For Our Dog And The Home Made Fudge And Biscuits Were A Lovely Surprise - An Exceptional Touch!  I Was Also Pleasantly Surprised At The Wonderful Array Of Activities Available At Bovey Even Though We Didn't Take Part.   My Sister Is Getting Married At Bovey Castle So We Very Much Look Forward To Returning To Bovey For That.  Thank You Again For A Lovely Stay!,,,,,
,1627,The Whole Weekend Was Perfect  And The Special Attention We Received After Getting Engaged Made The Weekend That More Special. Will Be Coming Back Every Year (Although Next Time I Will Bring My Golf Clubs!),,,,,
,1628,Overall A Very Enjoyable Stay With Excellent Service.,,,,,
,1629,See You Soon.,,,,,
,1630,Thank You. We Had A Fantastic Weekend. Bovey Castle & The Staff Are Great-We Have Already Recommended To Friends & Family.,,,,,
,1638,Consider Changing The Survey Around So That 'Strongly Agree' Is Listed As 5 Even If It Remains In The Same Place.  This May Avoid People Marking You As 'Strongly Disagree' By Accident Thinking That 5 Is A Higher Score Than 1.,,,,,
,1639,We Had A Very Interesting Conversation About Your Dove Meets Fish Logo.  Nobody Could Explain It.  It Would Be Interesting To Know Why And Also Tell The Staff.,,,,,
,1641,Great Experience And Would Certainly Be Happy To Receive Details Regarding Special Offers For The Hotel Or Lodges.,,,,,
,1643,Just Keep Up The Excellent Work - I Will And Already Have Thoroughly Recommended To Others,,,,,
,1645,We Would Question Whether To Come Back And Thankfully We Paid Via Travelzoo On A Discounted Price. We Would Have Been Horrified To Have Paid The Full Price With All The Errors. We Both Said We Would Like To Experience A Truly Exceptional Stay At Bovey Because It Should Be Possible.,,,,,
,1648,I Was Very Impressed And Touched To Have A Greeting Card  Hand Written By The General Manager Wishing Us A Pleasant Stay And Myself A Happy Birthday.,,,,,
,1649,It Would Be Nice To Come Again As Long As All Facilities Are Working,,,,,
,1651,Our Son Really Enjoyed The Bovey Rangers Activities Although Quite Expensive For 1.5 Hours,,,,,
,1653,I Can Only Repeat Something Needs To Be Done About The Running Of The Bistro And A More Varied Selection Of Food Provided In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,1655,Bovey Castle Is Enchanting.  We Did Enjoy Our Stay.  It Seems To Me A Few Things Need Some Tweaking.  The Food Was A Great Surprise And Something To Write Home About.  Hope You Can Keep Your Chef!,,,,,
,1656,The Shooting Experience Needs To Be More Clearly Defined As Being For Novices. This Was Not Made Clear When It Was Booked And Attended By My Husband.,,,,,
,1663,Just To Say Thank You Very Much For Making Our Stay So Perfect! This Was A Last Little Trip For My Husband And I Before Our Baby Arrives And It Was Absolutely Wonderful And Just What We Were Looking For. Thank You To All The Staff,,,,,
,1664,Really Enjoyed Our Stay  Thanks For Looking After Us Again And Especially Being So Nice With Lexi. Hope The Spa Improves Though As This Was A Big Part Of Us Returning.Best Regards Gerri,,,,,
,1665,I Am Still Awaiting An E-Mail Of The Final Bill As Your Machines Had Broken Down At The Time Of Checkout,,,,,
,1670,Will Be Back !,,,,,
,1671,We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Falconry Demonstration.,,,,,
,1672,We Had A Wonderful Time At Bovey Castle And Will Return Again And Again To Stay Both In Rose Cottage And In The Hotel. Very Impressed With Everything But Particularly The Staff.,,,,,
,1674,We Took Advantage Of An Extremely Competitive Offer By Travelzoo. Were Any Such Offers To Come Up Again We Would Certainly Visit You Again And Hopefully Use The Spa And Golf Facilities. We Live Locally And Would Be Able To Take Advantage Of Any Late Breaks.,,,,,
,1675,We Love The Hotel  And Keep Coming Back. The Service Has Always Been Impeccable - But This Time There Were Too Many Things That Weren't Up To Your Normally High Standards.,,,,,
,1676,Although The Service And Front Of House Was Well Below What Was Expected The Food Was Of A High Standard And It Was A Credit To The Chef,,,,,
,1680,Our Party Was Very Happy With All That Was Offered  Especially As We Were On A Travel Zoo Deal.  We Understood The Rules.  There Was A Customer Settling His Bill In Front Of Us Who Was Very Rude And Obnoxious To Your Pleasant Reception Staff - He Obviously Had Not Read The Small Print.  Presumably This Happens From Time To Time And I Wonder If It Would Help If Your Staff Briefly Pointed Out At The Beginning Of A Coupon Stay That There Are Things That Have To Be Paid For Over And Above The Deal Price.,,,,,
,1681,Cant Wait To Come Back,,,,,
,1683,The Activities We Participated In Were Fabulous  The Fly-Fishing Instructor- Mike Was Really Great And We Enjoyed Playing Golf At The Castle.  The Falconry Experience Was Good  But The Price Was High For The Value Received.,,,,,
,1685,Thank You For A Wonderful Stay Richard Had A Fantastic Birthday. Excellent! Ps It Seems I Cant Make A Comment On Trip Advisor As I Have Been In January! Will Get One The Family To Comment  Thank You To All The Team And To Jeremy Rata - The Boss Is Running A Tight Ship Well Done!,,,,,
,1688,Stunning Location. Would Like To Come Again Someday.,,,,,
,1693,None,,,,,
,1696,All The Members Of Staff That We Encountered Were Professional  Attentive And Friendly. Staff Can Sometimes Be Over Stuffy In Good Quality Hotels And That Is Off Putting. For Me  Bovey Castle Staff Achieved The Right Balance.,,,,,
,1697,We Enjoyed A Really Exceptional Stay In Which Every Detail Was Fulfilled To A Very High Standard  Thank You.,,,,,
,1698,I Stayed At The Hotel When It Was Known As The Manor House. I Was Very Pleasantly Surprised At The Improvement You Have Made And Will Certainly Be Back.,,,,,
,1700,We Look Forward To Coming Back ( When You Have Another Groupon Voucher),,,,,
,1701,Superb Hotel And Will Definitely Be Back,,,,,
,1703,At Breakfast There Was No Grapefruit Juice Or Segments,,,,,
,1705,I Thought The Hotel Bar Was Quite Overpriced  You Expect To Pay Over The Odds In A Hotel But Thought The Bistro Prices Were More In Line With What You'd Expect To Pay. Other Than That And The Breakfast I Couldn't Be More Happy With Our Stay,,,,,
,1706,A Wonderful Stay  With Some Of The Most Courteous And Friendly Staff I Have Come Across  Which Made For A Perfect Venue For My Brother's Wedding.  We Had A Fantastic Time  And I Am Grateful For Everyone At Bovey's Hard Work  Which Enabled My Brother And His (Now) Wife  And All Their Guests  To Have A Truly Special And Memorable Day.,,,,,
,1708,An Area That Is Covered & Protected From The Wind And Heated For The Purposes Of Comfortably Smoking A Cigar Would Be A Great Addition!,,,,,
,1709,A Perfect Vacation.,,,,,
,1710,Wonderful Hotel And Location  Facilities First Class  Just Felt That We Only Had 2 Restaurant Experiences And Both Did Not Go As Smoothly As They Should Have  Particularly Our Grill Experience. We Still Had A Great Family Break Though  But Did Tarnish It A Little.,,,,,
,1711,Some Of The Lighting Outside Around Walkways To The Lodges Around The Grounds Was Poor.,,,,,
,1712,We All Had Such S Lovely Time  The Hotel Staff Were All Polite And Made Us Feel Welcome  Children Were Well Looked After And It Was A Very Child Friendly Hotel As Well As Being Luxurious. We Would All Love To Come Back Again .,,,,,
,1713,We Will Definitely Visit Again For The Golf And Also The Deer Stalking And Clay Shooting.,,,,,
,1714,Bovey Castle Is A Fabulous Venue And The Service Offered To Clients Is Exactly What We Look For In A Hotel. It Makes You Feel Relaxed The Moment You Step Inside The Front Door. We Will Be Back.,,,,,
,1719,Enjoyable Experience But On The Side Of Expensive,,,,,
,1721,If Service Charge For Room  Dinner  Bed And Breakfast Is Charged It Is A Bit Much To Then Charge Service Again For A Bottle Of Wine!!!,,,,,
,1722,I Had A Good Stay Overall (Only With You For 1 Night) And I Felt Some Of The Public Areas Were Tired In Particular The Stair Carpet Is Worn Out!! In My Opinion This Is Not Something One Expects To See In A Hotel Such As Yours.,,,,,
,1724,Fountain Could Do With A Clean First Impressions And All That. Sorry Fed That The Bed And Sound Proofing Were The Only Negatives.,,,,,
,1725,Can't Wait Until Our Next Visit,,,,,
,1726,Thank You Again And Let's Hope Will Visit Bovey Castle Next Year Again When I Plan To Invite A Number Of My Friends To My Big Birthday.,,,,,
,1727,We Enjoyed The Falconry Display And Liked Your Owl On Reception!,,,,,
,1729,I Think The Addition Of Service Charge Per Room Is Unnecessary And Could Be Simply Built Into The Room Rate. Given That The Room Was Not Fully Serviced Each Time  It Was Also A Little Frustrating To Be Charged For It. Without A Charge A Blind Eye Would Have Been Turned.,,,,,
,1730,Staff Were Very Kind And Helpful In General But Bistro Staff Need More Training.,,,,,
,1732,Bovey Castle Is The Perfect Place To Get Away To. Everything You Need Is There And The Rest Of The World Feels A Million Miles Away!,,,,,
,1734,You Should Look After The Kind Of Guest You Except. There Have Been Some Guest Around Not Really Fitting Into Your House.,,,,,
,1737,I Know We Were Travel Zoo Visitors But Why Oh Why Were We Treated Like Second Class Citizens. Do You Feel This Is Up To Your Standards?,,,,,
,1738,Entire Front Desk And Bar Staff Were Warm And Friendly,,,,,
,1739,It Was An Expensive Treat For My Daughter's 30Th Birthday  But Was Well Worth The Money (Especially On A Travelzoo Deal),,,,,
,1743,One Of Our Best Stays In The Uk For Several Years.,,,,,
,1744,We However Did Have A Relaxing And Enjoyable Stay With You The Setting Was Outstanding And Beautiful We Enjoyed The Falconry Display It Was Very Entertaining And Would Encourage Our Friends And Family To Stay At Bovey Castle And We Would Come Again To Stay In The Future ,,,,,
,1747,Mobile Phone Reception Appauling,,,,,
,1750,The Golf Shop Staff Were Helpful And The Bird Display Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1751,Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay At Bovey Castle And Would Love To Come Back But Could Not Face Eating In The Edwardian Restaurant Again.  Prices Are High Which We Are Happy To Pay As The Food And Wine Was Lovely But The Surroundings Must Be Enjoyed As Well.  Take A Tip From All Your Beautiful Lounges And Bar .. There Must Be Something That Can Be Done.  The Staff Are Excellent And The Hotel Manager Federico Couldn't Have Done More  What A Lovely Man.,,,,,
,1753,We Will Be Back .,,,,,
,1758,It Was The Most Fantastic Venue I've Ever Stayed In And Thoroughly Enjoyed Myself.,,,,,
,1762,Very Disappointed That The Draught Bitter Was Unavailable For Our Entire Stay Despite Me Asking For It Repeatedly From The First Night And It Being Relatively Easy For You To Arrange,,,,,
,1765,Only That In A Hotel As Big As Bovey Castle The Snooker Table Seems To Have Been Put Into A Room That Isnt Big Enough - Even For A 3/4 Size Table.,,,,,
,1766,I Was So Looking Forward To Our Stay With You As It Was One Hotel I Have Always Wanted To Come And Stay. Sadly It Didn't Come Up To My Expectations.,,,,,
,1767,I Hope To Be Back Soon.,,,,,
,1768,Repeat Customers Should Feel That They Are Recognised And Distinguised From First Time/One Time Visitors. Your Hotel Is Very Special And Therefor The Appeal To Come Back Is Great - That Should Be Reflected In Your Customer Care Processes....,,,,,
,1771,The Grounds And Activities For The Children Were First Class,,,,,
,1772,Perfect Time-Thank-You,,,,,
,1773,The Shower In The Bathroom Wasn't Very Good. I Used The Shower In The Pool Changing Rooms,,,,,
,1778,Just A Thank You To All For A Wonderfull Stay.,,,,,
,1779,Enjoyed The Stay And Will Proably Become Repeat Guests At Some Time,,,,,
,1780,No,,,,,
,1781,As An Animal Lover And Against Any Sport Which I Feel Demeans Or Inflicts Unnecessary Suffering  I Found The Use Of What Should Have Been A Wild Bird For Falconry Purposes (I Had The Unpleasant Experience Of Hearing Its Cries As We Checked Out) Rather Sickening.  Also  That Poor Parrot Stuck In Quite A Small Cage In One Of Your Lounges Was Not Very Pleasing To Look At Either.  Whilst I Appreciate Most Of Your Guests Find That Sort Of Stuff Pleasant  It Might Put Me Off Coming Again.,,,,,
,1782,We Found The Bistro A Little Dull And Could Be Perked Up To Make More Appealing.  Disappointing One Couldn't Get A Mid Afternoon Slice Of Homemade Cake After Golf.  No Fruit/Herb Teas.,,,,,
,1783,The Information Booklet On Local Walks Was Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,1786,Bit Surprised To See Black Mould In The Bathroom!,,,,,
,1787,We Had A Wonderful Stay - Thank You All So Much.  I Have Written Personally To Federico To Thank Him.  I Have Also Been On Trip Advisor With My Comments  So I Hope This Has Helped.  I Have Also Mentioned It To Other Friends  Who Will Be Making Contact With You Soon.,,,,,
,1788,Our Private Falconry Experience Was Superbly Entertaining. A Definite Highlight. Overall A Very Successful Stay In A Lovely Location - And In Lovely Weather! We All Felt We Could Have Done With A Few More Days With You. We Wish You Well.,,,,,
,1789,I Have Already Touted Your Facilities And Hope These Recommendations Will Result In Some Bookings,,,,,
,1793,If I Were The Marketing Manager Of A Resort Of This Calibre I Would Have Immediately Given Our Tour Leader A Free 4 Ball To Come Back. They Had Our Address Which Would Indicate We Would Have To Book Further Accommodation And Meals And Thus Increase The Income - An Opportunity Lost. Also - Adding A 'Service Charge' To Each Item Is Not Necessary  Other Than To Annoy. It Would Be More Acceptable To Increase Your Prices To Include These Irritating Charges. Overall We Had A Wonderful Time And The Hotel Superb And Staff Were Attentive And Helpful At All Times. I Would Definitely Return ,,,,,
,1796,Such A Shame That The Wonderful Dining Experience We Had On The Sat Evening Was Not Anything Like The Same On The Sunday Evening  Partly Due To Quality Of Food And Poorly Trained Staff!,,,,,
,1799,We Look Forward To Coming Back!,,,,,
,1800,I Was Proud To Return To A Hotel Which I Had Known As A Manager In The Company Who Had Owned And Operated It From The Beginning Under The Aegis Of British Transport Hotels. It Was Good To See It In Good Health And In Good Hands-Still.,,,,,
,1801,As I Said Earlier  We Knew And Loved The Hotel When It Was A British Rail Hotel  And Were Very Pleased To See Is Restored To Its Former Glory.,,,,,
,1802,Our Stay Was Relaxing And Tranquil Thanks To All Concerned,,,,,
,1804,The Important Features That Appealed To Us Were The Natural Beauty Of The Location  The Golf Course  The Indoor Swimming Pool. Our Children Gave Us One Night At Your Hotel And We Enquired About Staying Another However The Room Rate Offered Was Very High Even Though You Were Enjoying Only A Low Occupancy Rate. We Therefore Stayed The Second Night In Alternative Accomodation Nearby.,,,,,
,1805,No,,,,,
,1807,None,,,,,
,1809,Will Return.,,,,,
,1810,No,,,,,
,1814,I Would Like To Add That My Time At The Castle Was Truely Relaxing And Enjoyable And This Was Made Easier By Your Exceptional Staff Who All Made Us Feel Welcome And Attended To Our Every Need.,,,,,
,1816,We Loved The Staff Uniforms And The Homely Well Furnished Rooms - The Experience Was Very Much Like Visiting A Country Estate As Friends - Fantastic! We'll Definitely Come Again And Are Recommending It To All Our Friends... :-),,,,,
,1818,I Would Love To Return And Enjoy Your Facilities To The Full Soon  And Am Keen To Walk The Grounds In Fine Weather. I Hope To Visit In The Next 6 Months. Thank You,,,,,
,1819,I Was Impressed When The Receptionist Offered To Remove The Service Charge At Checkout When I Was Going Through Our Account Which Was Good -Although We Did'nt,,,,,
,1820,I Was Privileged To Come On A Wine Jolly At A Good Rate However I Hope To Return Next Month With The Family-I Loved Everything About It.,,,,,
,1821,The Cost Of Staying At The Hotel (Which By Any Means Is Not Inexpensive) Should Include Free Wi-Fi. It Looks Cheap Asking For Â£5 (Per Day Was It?) When Other Less Expensive Hotels Do Not Charge.,,,,,
,1823,Cant Wait To Come Back!,,,,,
,1826,We Were Very Lucky To Find A Fire To Sit And Read By But We Realised That Most Of The Rooms Had The Sofas And Fires Etc Taken Up With Afternoon Teas. It Occured To Us That This Must Be Hard For Guests Who Were Staying Not To Be Able To Find Anywhere To Sit During That Afternoon Time. Having Said That The Bedroom Suite Was Lovely So There Was The Choice To Go There. As I Said  We Did Not Experience An Issue And Were Lucky.,,,,,
,1827,This Is Our Third Stay At Bovey And We Intend To Stay Again In The Autumn This Year. As Always We Had A Great Experience And The Staff Made Us So Welcome And Made Our Stay Very Memorable. We Cannot Wait To Stay Again.,,,,,
,1828,Too Short A Stay,,,,,
,1831,It Is A Lovely Hotel And We Will Return.  Only Small Niggles Really!  I Would Say The Only Thing That Marred The Visit Was The Bathroom As It Wasn't Up To Your Usual Standards.,,,,,
,1832,We Loved Our Stay - We Loved The Spa Facilities And Particularly The Falconry Display Which Was        Informative And Enjoyable And Fun!,,,,,
,1834,Good Idea To Put People Who Respond Into Prize Draw  Or Something To Encourage More Feedback.,,,,,
,1835,The Venue Is Superb But What Makes The Experience Of Staying Here Truly Exceptional Is The Quality Of The Staff.  I Got The Impression That The Hotel Was Operating With A Restricted Maintenance Budget And Hope That This Will Be Increased.,,,,,
,1836,Enjoyed Falconry Display.Very Good Having Breakfast Up Till 11Am Excellent Cold Selection.,,,,,
,1837,We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Falcon Display. We Enjoyed A Wonderful Family Celebratory Weekend. I Have Mentioned Just A Few Details Which If Addressed Would Move Bovey Castle From An Excellent Hotel To An Outstanding One. We Would Not Hesitate To Return And Would Recommend The Hotel To Friends And Family. The Staff Are The Hotel's Greatest Asset And They Deserved Their Service Charge.,,,,,
,1838,Oh  I Just Remembered We Were Sat At The Back Of The Service In The Garden And Couldnt Hear Anything  I Believe The Microphone Didnt Work  Such A Shame As She Is My God Daughter And I Would Have Loved To Have Heard Her Vows She Spoke To Him And The Readings,,,,,
,1842,Fabulous - Look Fwd To Staying Again,,,,,
,1844,I Had An Amazing Stay At Bovey Castle And Could Not Fault It. However As You Probably Are Aware Of The Fight That Happened Outside The Entrance On Saturday 1St October At About 10Pm  I Was Absolutly Disgusted By. I Know The Matter Was Out Of Your Hand But I Did Not Expect Things Like This To Be Happening Outside My Bedroom Room When Paying Â£250 A Night To Stay With You. I Was Going To Complain On Depeature But The Wedding Guest Were Also Checking Out And I Doubt They Wanted To Be Reminded Of What Had Happened The Night Before.,,,,,
,1847,I Found Bovey Castle Really Frustrating - It Is A Beautiful Building In A Beautiful Setting  And I Felt That The Staff Really Did Want To Provide Guests With A Wonderful Experience  But I Just Do Not Feel The Hotel Is Reaching Its Potential. In Its Current State I Felt That What It Offers Is Good But Overpriced - It Is Certainly Not World Class Luxury Currently. Having Stayed At Gidleigh Park On Several Occasions And Having Recently Returned From A Week At Sandy Lane In Barbados  I Felt That Bovey Castle Lagged Significantly Behind In Terms Of Service And Professionalism  But I Feel It Could Get There With Proper Investment In Training And In The Facilities.,,,,,
,1848,It Maybe Worth Considering Providing Some Indoor Activities For People To Do When Weather Is Bad. The Spa Is Fantastic (It's One Of The Reasons Why We Chose To Stay At Yours Instead Of Gidleigh This Time) Maybe It's Worth Putting In A Pool/Ping Pong Table Or Something Somewhere? The Leisure Activities Advertised On The Website Is Not Really Clearly Noticeable At The Hotel To Give People Inspiration/Ideas To Just Randomly Go And Do Something New  Yes There Were Two Boards Used Near The Entrance But I Believe They Were Both Advertising Stuff For The Kids?,,,,,
,1851,Overall We Found Our Stay A Pleasant And Comfortable One. However We Found The Cleanliness Of The Bistro A Bit Disappointing. The Base Of The Glass Lamp Stands Need A Good Polish And After Ordering A Coffee And Cake On The Sunday Found That The Waiter Cleaned The Crumbs Off Of The Table After He Had Put Our Order On The Table!,,,,,
,1852,We Look Forward To Visiting Again Archimedes Should Be A More Regular Feature At Reception The Golf Buggies Is An Excellent Idea,,,,,
,1856,Perfect Xmas  Such A Change From The Normal Routine  Can't Thank You Enough,,,,,
,1859,My Car Was Left Unlocked In The Car Park  But Dealt With When I Had Pointed This Out,,,,,
,1861,Fantastic Stay Which The Whole Family Enjoyed Thank You.,,,,,
,1864,We Were Very Impressed  And Thoroughly Enjoyed The Stay. Have Stayed In Lots Of 5 Star Hotels All Over The World With My Previous Job  And I Think Bovey Castle Was Definately Amongst The Best. I Think Apart From The Obvious Grandeur Of The Building And Gardens  Most Of The Credit Should Be Taken By The Hotel Manager Who Works Really Hard  Motivates His Staff  And In My Oppinion Gets It Just Right. Thank You!,,,,,
,1866,I Guess Just To Say That Its Clear You Actively Target Families With Children And Dogs. I Would Just Like To Reinforce The Need To Continue Whatever Advice You Give To Parents And Dog Owners About Keeping Them Under Control. In The Bedroom Opposite Us  The Couple Had 2 Large Dogs In Their Room. We Were Not Aware Of This Until We Heard Them Barking. We Were Not Too Happy About This And Mentioned It To A Member Of Your Team Who Took It Seriously And Asked Your Client Relations Manager To Have A Quiet Word Which Obviously Worked As We Didn't Hear Them Again. We Also Noticed The Next Day Another Lady With Her Lap Dog. The Dog Was Sitting On The Couch In The Lounge. We Were Not Too Happy About This.  Overall  A Wonderful Experience. We Wished We Could Have Stayed Longer. Congratulations The Team Who All Made Us Feel Special And Were Most Attentive. Thank You.,,,,,
,1867,More Detail On The Final Reciept  I Hated Asking About Individual Items.,,,,,
,1868,Looking Forward To More Deals So That We Can Come Back Again And Again.,,,,,
,1869,The Swimming Pool And Changing Facilities Were Exceptional As They Always Are  Very Clean And Welcoming.,,,,,
,1870,I Would Defently Reccommend This Hotel To All My Friends And Family And To Tripadvisor Also,,,,,
,1872,Activities - Lovely To Have The Falconery Display - Very Good Booked For Archery & Rifle Shooting And Archery Was Excellent But Perhaps Fireing Two Pellets Does Not Constitute Rifle Shooting.  We Were Expecting A Few Scoring Targets.,,,,,
,1874,Please Let Me Know About Any Special Spa Packages You Put On In The Future,,,,,
,1875,Like Having Our Own Country House In Devon.,,,,,
,1879,N/A,,,,,
,1880,We Highlighted The Issue Of Noise In Our Room And Ashley Dealt With It Efficiently And Effectively We Were Very Impressed,,,,,
,1881,I Want To Return. We Had Perfect Weather Which Made Our Stay Even More Delightful  I Felt Spoiled And Loved The Location.,,,,,
,1885,Overall We Had A Very Luxurious Stay And Have Left Feeling Extremely Revitalised And Pampered,,,,,
,1887,We Were Abit Surprised At The Cost Of The Car Serviec As We Chose To Use It On The Friday We Arrived To Be Driven To The Local Pub - Ring Of Bells. We Were Not Told It Was Â£10 Each Way For This  Which Was Not Very Fair As We Could Have Walked Or Driven Ourselves And Led To Believe This Was A Courtesy Service.,,,,,
,1889,The Cider And Gin Making Trip Was Excellent !!  It Has Inspired Us To Make Cider And We Are Already Brewing Some 'Mango Gin'.  Cheers !!,,,,,
,1890,Breakfast Service In Comparison To The Evening Meal Lacked Attentiveness.  We Had To Wait Before We Were Noticed Or To Get A Waiters Attention  And Had To Request Several Items Such As The Menu  Butter  Toast And Tea/Cofffee.,,,,,
,1891,Very Impressive Location And Service,,,,,
,1899,Thank You For True Escapism!,,,,,
,1900,Enjoyed Beaky's Company. What A Legend! The Owl On Reception  Who Also Starred At The Falconry Display (Sorry  Can't Remember His Name)  And His Owner/Trainer Were Also Very Good And Entertaining!   A Few Small Communication Issues At Breakfast With One Waiter Who Didn't Know The Difference Between Honey And Marmalade! After Asking For Some Of The Latter  We Ended Up With More Pots Of The Former So Decided To Give Up Asking! Although We Found It Quite Funny  Other Guests May Not.,,,,,
,1901,We Thought The Bird Display Was Very Good.,,,,,
,1903,Hotel Manager Was Amazing  Very Dedicated As We Saw Him Helping With The Runnings Of The Hotel  We Were Also Lucky Enough To Chat With Him.,,,,,
,1905,Thank You For A Wonderfull Experience  See You Soon.,,,,,
,1906,Great To See You All Again - Hope To Be Back Soon!,,,,,
,1907,10 Out Of 10.,,,,,
,1911,It Was Too Hot In Our Room And We Had A Poor Nights Sleep.,,,,,
,1912,Feel That Regular Maintenance Needs To Be Carried Out On The Rooms  To Ensure That They Reflect The Reputation That Bovey Castle Holds.,,,,,
,1913,Polly Who Helped Us Arrange Everything Was Brilliant From Start To Finnish. We Also Plan To Right A Detailed Trip Advisor Review Explaining How Happy We Were With Our Stay/Wedding. Thankyou For Everything.,,,,,
,1916,The Lodges Were Absolutely Amazing Although The Outside Light Didn't Work In One!,,,,,
,1920,Not A Criticism  But Something My Husband Mentioned .... Your Website Is Not Pda Compatible So If You Are Trying To Look Up Your Address / Postcode For Example On An I-Phone It Is Not Possible To Find It. This Is Probably Not Something You Ever Try To Do So Take A Look And See. We Wanted To Double Check Directions Whilst We Were En Route And It Just Would Not Work With An I-Phone.,,,,,
,1922,Do You Have Room For Two People And Their Dog To Move In Permanently?! We Will Be Back In The Summer...,,,,,
,1924,We Had A Fabulous Time At Bovey Castle  And Will Definitely Be Visiting You Again!,,,,,
,1926,What An Amazing Place- Thank-You.,,,,,
,1927,Definitely Come Back If Offer From Groupon Again,,,,,
,1928,Such A Superb Hotel/Spa  Amazing Food And Great Staff. So Refreshing To Have Such A High Level Of Excellence In All Areas And Without That 'Stuffy' Feel That Other 5 Star Hotels Can Have. Amazing  Will Be Recommending And Will Definitely Return. Thank You To All Who Work At Bovey Castle!,,,,,
,1931,Did Not Realise Service Charge Was Discretionary,,,,,
,1932,Over All The Venue Was Lovely The Setting Perfect For Proposing To My Fiancee  Who I Am Delighted To Say She Said Yes!,,,,,
,1933,When Checking Out Of The Hotel  You Had Doubled Up On Charges For Grocery Delivery And Service Charge On This. I Fail To Understand How You Could Work Out That Â£28 Of Groceries And Â£4.50 Of Telephone Calls  Could Warrant A Service Charge Of Â£36. It Took Me To Point This Out And I Have No Doubt That Many People Just Pay This And Look At The Bill Later. I Am Afriad I Left With A Very Bad Taste In My Mouth And Will Find It Difficult To Recommend This Hotel To Friends And Clients.,,,,,
,1934,Overall We Did Enjoy Our Stay At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,1936,The Hotel Grounds Are Spectacular And We Enjoyed The Croquet  And Putting. I Would Definitely Stay Again But Probably In A Lodge.,,,,,
,1937,Great Stay We Will Be Back Soon Thank You Very Much !!!!!,,,,,
,1941,I Would Reccomnend Bovey Castle To Anyone Who Wants A 5* Experience,,,,,
,1947,Wish We Had A Longer Stay,,,,,
,1948,My Husband And Myself Would Not Have Been Able To Afford The Wonderful Time Without Using The Offer.   Maybe To Fill The Hotel  As There Wasn't Many People Dining Maybe The Prices Could Be More Affordable For The Middle Class Person,,,,,
,1949,The Hotel The Grounds And Gardens And The Staff Made It All It To An Excellent Experience,,,,,
,1950,Breakfast Room Service Could Be Better - We Were Woke At 8 (After Specifying A 9-9.30 Breakfast) Then They Did Come Back At 9.15Am But There Were Breakfast Items Missing From The Tray- At Â£19.95 For Breakfast  It Should Be Pretty Good.,,,,,
,1958,Thought The Hawk Demo Was Brilliant. We Couldn't Have Had A Better Stay.,,,,,
,1960,Fabulous Stay As Always,,,,,
,1964,Great To See That So Much Attention Was Given For Child Entertainment,,,,,
,1966,Great Venue  Falconry Was Great  Some Of The Waiting/Bar Staff Were Less Attentive Than Expected.,,,,,
,1969,The Hotel Was Extremely Hot For The Three Day That I Was There.  It's Nice To Be Warm  But It Was Bordering On Uncomfortably Hot!  I Would Suggest Turning The Heating Down.,,,,,
,1971,A Very Relaxing Stay In Lovely Surroundings. The Staff Were Very Friendly And Provided Excellent Service.,,,,,
,1972,Can't Wait To Go Back And Enjoy The Whole Experience Again!,,,,,
,1974,We Stayed As A Break From Our Children  But I Was Impressed To See The Friendliness Of Staff Towards Other Families And We May Return With The Sprogs Next Time.,,,,,
,1976,We Love Bovey Castle And All It Has To Offer.  We Tried Croquet  Archery  Played Snooker  Had A Go In A Golf Cart For A Day  Played Tennis  Swam  Used The Spa And Tried To Take Advantage Of The Wonderful Location As Much As We Could.  The Weather Was Great For Our Week And We Spent A Lot Of Time With You.  We Will Come Back  But I'm Unsure If We Would Pay Almost Â£2000 For The Lodge Again.  I Would Hope That The Carpets Have Some Urgent Attention And Are Regularly Cleaned.  They Are Just Scruffy And Its Disappointing.  High Level Cleaning Was Also Missed - We Found Remains Of A Balloon On One Side Of The Balustrade And Other Debris And Many Cobwebs Which Could Have Been Reached But Were Left.  All Negatives Aside  We Did Enjoy Our Week But It Just Went Too Fast!,,,,,
,1977,Loved Merlin The Owl He Was Very Sweet  The Chicken And Ferrets.    Bikes Were Good Too.,,,,,
,1978,I Would Rather Have Decided Tips Myself Rather Than Having A Service Charge Added To Everything. When We Did Remove It It Was Added Back In To The Final Bill,,,,,
,1980,Not Having Breakfast Included In The Room Rate Was A Disappointment,,,,,
,1981,I Would Like To Say A Huge Thank You To Everyone For A Wonderful Stay  We Had 5 Families  3 Of Which Had Not Been To Bovey Before And They Have All Said That They Thought It Was Wonderful. Frederico And The Team Did A Fantastic Job.,,,,,
,1983,On A Negative Note An Expensive Item Of Makeup Went Missing From A Bedroom Which We Are 100% Certain Was Not Down To Our Error.,,,,,
,1984,Yes.  As Previously Mentioned Some Members Of The Team Who Were Excellent  Including The Receptionists.  The Staff Responsible For Activities - Clay Pigeon  Cider And Gin And Spa Staff Were All Excellent.  The Dining Experience And The Service Of Some Members Was Very Disappointing.  The Suggested Service Charge Is Unneccessary And Rather Insulting.  I Would Have Only Expected To See This On The Restuarant Bills.  No Other Hotel I Have Stayed At Has Suggest Service Charge On Any Other Service.  You Do Have The Potential To Be Outstanding But Youre Not There Yet.,,,,,
,1988,The Recommended Walks  Falconry Display And Gardens Made This Visit Really Special. Bovey Castle Is Beautiful  Christmas Must Be Magical There. Thank You,,,,,
,1990,Discretionary Service Charge  I Feel We Should Feel Obliged To Pay  I Appreciate You Give Some Of This To Charity But To Pay For The Staff Christmas Party And Staff Bonus Every Month. I Would Of Tipped The Staff Or Left A Contributions I Felt Reflected The Service I Had And Not For The Hotel To Expect This No Matter What The Service. I Have Read On Trip Advisor Some People If They Complained Did Not Have To Pay This  We Are Not One To Make A Fuss Ie Over The Radiator Not Working Maybe We Should Of.,,,,,
,1996,We Had The Most Wonderful Time At Bovey Castle  And Would Have No Hesitation In Recommending The Place To Friends  Or Indeed In Returning Ourselves.  The Above Comments Are Made Purely For Constructive Reasons  And I Would Honestly Say That The Biggest Deal Is The Service Charge Which Is Added Automatically.  We Were Made (Whether Intentionally Or Not) To Feel Obliged To Pay This  And As Though We Were Not Appreciative By Not Wishing To Pay It.  This Was Such A Shame  As Up Until This Point  We Had Had The Most Perfect Experience!  I'm Sure Others Must Feel The Same.  All That Said  Thank You So Much For A Fantastic Time; We Really Did Fall In Love With The Place.,,,,,
,1998,The Falconry Display Is A Definite Draw  We Have Watched It 3 Times Now And Each Have Thoroughly Enjoyed It  A Definite Plus For The Hotel!,,,,,
,2001,All Included. I Would Potentially Come Back If I Thought The Service Would Be Better As It Is A Lovely Setting,,,,,
,2004,Our Daughter Loved The Feeding Of The Chicken Experience And The Tour Person Was Very Kind. Great Idea For The Kids.,,,,,
,2009,Looking Forward To Our Next Stay. We Will Be Back In Sept 2014 Latest With Our Group Of Swiss People So We Will Get In Touch For The Bookings. But Hope To Be There Earlier Next Year For Some Research,,,,,
,2010,Stunned That You Have A Policy To Add A Service Charge To All Costs! We Removed Ours From The Bill As We Couldn't Justify Having Spent Â£850 For 2 Nights (Excluding Substantial Discounts Received). With The Exception Of The Manager There Was No Member Of Staff That Stood Out To Us Who Warranted A Tip - Maybe The Lady In The Grill Who Seemed To Manage Breakfast.,,,,,
,2011,The Archery Experience Was Extremely Enjoyable And Matt Was Very Pleasant And Helpful,,,,,
,2012,Nice Enough  Though Wouldn't Return Unless It Was At A Very Special Rate  Would Rather Pay More And Go To Gidleigh Or Gleneagles - Though Dartmoor Is Beautiful.,,,,,
,2013,Our Stay Was Wonderful And The Reception Staff  Main Restaurant Manager And Hotel Manager Were Excellent.,,,,,
,2014,On Departure  We Were Informed Of A Charge For 2 Phonecalls From The Room Which We Had No Knowledge Of At All.  However  The Receptionist Informed Us Sometimes There Are Errors On The System And We Would Not Be Charged.,,,,,
,2017,Everything Was Absolutely Great!,,,,,
,2018,It Was A Lovely Experience. Many Thanks To The Team At Bovey Castle And I Hope You All Have A Great Christmas.,,,,,
,2019,The Lounge / Bar / Library Were Very Homely And Comfortable.  The Open Fires Were Very Inviting And Each Room Had Its Own Qualities Which Again We Took Advantage Of And Enjoyed - Thank You.  We Would Obviously Love To Come Back  When You Feel Confident That Our Points Have Been Noted And Hopefully Rectified  As Your Guests  Should You Wish To Invite Us To Check Out The Improvements That You Have Hopefully Been Able To Implement At The Hotel From The Comments We Have Made.  We Should Be Pleased To Hear To Your Comments Regarding Our Comments    ,,,,,
,2020,Above All  We Liked The Atmosphere And Ambience Of The Hotel  Its Various Areas  (Lounges And Bar) And The Way We Felt So Relaxed And At Home. I Had Worried That It Might Be Pretentious And That We Would Feel Out Of Place But This Was Not So. It Was A Fantastic Treat And I Will Certainly Be Recommending It To Friends.,,,,,
,2022,Although Our Room Did Not Have The Wonderful Views Offered At The Front Of The Hotel This Was Reflected In The Price  And We Were Happy.,,,,,
,2023,Thanks We Had A Great Time  The Place Is Gorgeous  Staff Brilliant  But Even Allowing For That The Prices Are Too High And Will Be A Serious Inhibitor To Further Visits.,,,,,
,2024,The Experience At Bovey Castle Was Fantastic  The Staff Were Excellent.  Particular Thanks To Adam And John For Making The Crolf So Enjoyable For Our Team.  The Falconry Display Was Fabulous And Martin Was Very Amusing. The Only Sad Part Was The Rain  But That's Out Of Your Control! Whilst My Visit Was For A Team Building Event With My Employers  I Would Love To Visit Again For Leisure.,,,,,
,2025,Overall Excellent  Much Better Than The Average Venue And A Truly Memorable Stay Thank You,,,,,
,2026,I Was Not Aware A Service Charge Would Be Added To Our Bill And Was Not Made Aware It Was Discretionary.  I Don't Remember It Being Pointed Out On A Drinks Or Food Menu.  I Do Not Agree With This Charge  As It Seems Ridiculous To Pay A Service Charge For Ordering A Drink At The Bar.  I Think The Hotel Is A Lovely Building Overall  But That It Needs A Little Tlc.,,,,,
,2027,Only About The Service Charge Policy. When We Came To Pay  We Found That Â£188 Had Been Added To The Bill For Service Charge. Given That We Spent Â£2 500 Plus For A 3 Day Break  That Was Disappointing. Whilst It Is Stated To Be Optional  It Is Embarrassing For Guests To Have To Remove It (Or Scale It Back As We Did). Given Your Rates  We Would Expect Service To Be Included Or To Be Added At The Instigation Of Guests For Truly Exceptional Service. One Expects Great Service Given The Cost Of The Stay  The Drinks Etc. At Chewton Glen  They Have Signs Up Advising Guests Not To Tip The Staff With The Motto 'Service Is Our Pleasure'. That Puts Guests At Ease. The Hotel Should Pay Its Staff - Not The Guests. Tips Are For Service Over And Above The Norm.,,,,,
,2028,We Were With You To Celebrate A Birthday; And The Upgrade To Room 50 Was Unexpected And A Very Lovely Surprise For Us - Thank You. On The Final Night Of Our Stay  Our In Room Breakfast Card Was Not Collected And Was Still Hanging Outside Our Door The Next Morning  Which We Only Found Out When We Looked Out At 7.45 Am; Which Meant We Had A Rather Hurried Breakfast Downstairs Instead Of The Gentle Quiet One We Had Hoped For Between 7 And 7.30.  The Only 'Negative' In Our Stay With You.   Otherwise We Had A Lovely Time  Thanks To All For Making Our Stay So Special.,,,,,
,2030,We Had Such A Fabulous Time  All The Staff We Met Were Lovely  I'm Just Sorry We Cant Remember All Their Names. Our Dog Loved It Too She'll Definatley Be Back For The Chews And We Hope To Accompany Her! Thank You!,,,,,
,2034,No One Wanted To Leave!,,,,,
,2035,Cannot Wait To Return But Would Probably Do This On A B And B Basis,,,,,
,2037,Excellent - We Will Be Back.  Thank You!,,,,,
,2038,Thank You For A Great Stay,,,,,
,2041,The Only Dissappointment Was The Wall Outside Our Room  With The Noise From The Fan. It Maybe A Good Idea To Warn Guests Before They Arrive. The Room Number Was 33.,,,,,
,2043,At Breakfast The Level Of Service Was Definitely Not 5 Star - Staff Seemed More Interested In Talking Than Providing Service  The Breakfast Itself Was Very Good Quality,,,,,
,2046,I Was Very Anxious About The Trip But Everything Was So Perfect - Thank You,,,,,
,2048,Overall Experience Was Very Favourable. It's A Shame The Hotel Isn't Nearer!,,,,,
,2049,I Feel That Noisy Rooms Should Be Let At A Lower Rate. Ours Was A Castle Room Which Is Not One Of Your Basic Rooms. Because We Booked With Secret Escapes I Did Not Have The Opportunity To Book A Better Room Although I Assumed For The Amount We Paid The Room Would Have Been Adequate. By The Time I Realised How Noisy It Was It Was Too Late To Do Anything About It.,,,,,
,2052,We Would Stay Again But Would Hope The Breakfast Will Have Improved,,,,,
,2054,We Found At Times Reception Deck Very Busy And Booked Afternoon Tea  But The Name Was Never Added  So Poor Waiting Staff Had To Fit Us In Felt Guilty But They Were Wonderful,,,,,
,2055,You Have A Lovely Hotel Which We Would Very Much Like To Visit Again. A Few Tweaks Will Make It Perfect.,,,,,
,2056,Excellent!!!!!,,,,,
,2059,The Public Rooms Are Outstanding. Nevertheless  Apart From The Hotel Manager And The Housekeeper  You Are Left With The Impression That The Hotel Is Staffed By Well Meaning Young People Who Perhaps Do Not Have The Same Standards Of Excellence As The Hotel Guests.,,,,,
,2061,As This Was The Second Time We Have Stayed We Enjoyed Our Experience As Much As Before And Will Certainly Look To Stay Again,,,,,
,2063,My Overall Comments Will Tell You That I Have Very Little To Add Of A Negative Nature. However I Do Think It Is Expensive Which Is A Pity As I Would Visit More Often If I Felt It Represented Better Value For Money.,,,,,
,2067,We Very Much Enjoyed The Walks Around The Castle And Were Very Happy That The Hotel Had Some Walks Set Out For Us. Falconry Is Lovely Touch.,,,,,
,2068,Up The Standards Of The Staff  More Communication Between Booking In And Kitchen Staff  Bring Back The Gluton Free Bread Rolls As No One Wants Slices Of Bread When They Are Waiting For Their Meals...Fed The Manager Was Quick To Put Our Complain Right On The 2Nd Night.,,,,,
,2069,It Would Only Be Cost That Would Prevent Us Coming Again  Otherwise We Loved The Place.,,,,,
,2070,Carry On Doing What You Do Because You Do It Very Well.,,,,,
,2072,A Broader Room Service Menu Would Be Good. We Didn't Enjoy What We Had  Though We Are Aware If We Could Have Waited Then Something From The Restaurant Could Have Been Requested.,,,,,
,2074,I Was So Looking Forward To Staying At Bovey Castle  My Sister Was Married On The 15Th Sept And Held Her Reception There. The Whole Experience Was Rather Dampened With The Loss Of My Aunties Luggage. We Found Her Sat In Reception For Alot Of The Evening And So Myself And My Partner Stayed With Her To Keep Her Company As She Was Obviously Upset. As A Result We Sadly Missed Alot Of The Evening Entertainment  Live Band  Hog Roast  Casino Whilst Awaiting News Of The Luggage Which Never Turned Up Until The Next Morning. I Know This Was Sorted Out With My Auntie The Next Day But It Did Have An Effect On Us As It Spoilt Mine & My Partners Evening Too Worrying About My Auntie.,,,,,
,2075,A Huge Thank You  To You And Your Team.  We Would Love To Come Back  But Sadly Think It Will Be A One Off Massive Special Treat  But Never Say Never!  If We Can We Will...,,,,,
,2079,The Discretionary Service Charge Is Annoying As It Is Applied Automatically To Every Transaction  Which Is Unfair. So Any Single Drink Ordered Has The Charge Added On And This Only Becomes Apparent When Settling The Bill. Its A Bit Underhand And Not Worthy Of The Rest Of The Experience Of Bovey Castle Which Is Great.,,,,,
,2080,The Prices In The Bistro Are Too High For The Quality Of Food That Is Delivered.  I Would Not Choose To Eat There Again.  Increase The Quality  Or Decrease The Prices.,,,,,
,2081,Yes  I Have Just Bought A Half Day Spa Deal On Groupon. I Imagine Groupon Take A Sizeable Chunk Of The Fee  Would It Not Make Sense To Offer Cut Price Deals To Your Regular Guests Via Email  So That The Hotel Profits?,,,,,
,2082,We Were Disappointed As We Would Of Visited Regularly With Friends But Not Sure We Will Return Now,,,,,
,2085,Unfortunately Our Payment Card Was Rejected. We Paid On Another Card And Contacted Our Card Issuer. We Were Informed That No Effort Was Made To Charge The Card. We Found This A Little Worrying As We Wondered If The Card Had Been Used Without Our Knowledge Resulting In It Being Blocked. Also A Little Embarrassing To Have Our Payment Rejected.,,,,,
,2086,It Is Very Expensive.,,,,,
,2089,Was Not Aware Play Room Was Chargeable.,,,,,
,2090,Hovering In The Corridor Before 7 Was A Bit Much,,,,,
,2092,The Hotel Is In Stunning Suroundings And Looks Amazing From The Outside.  The Inside Looks Like It Needs A Little Tlc.  It Has Water Stains On The Wallpaper In The Edwardian Restaurant And Several Other Areas.  There Are Threadbare Carpets Around The Hotel And It Just Gives The Impression That It Has Started To Be A Little Neglected.  The Staff Were Superb And They Made The Stay Worthwhile.  If The Staff Had Not Been As Good As They Were We Would Never Consider Coming Back.  As It Is We Probably Will Return In The Future Hoping That Some Investment Has Been Made To Update And Renew The Interior And Give The Food Another Go.  In Summary  Great Staff  Excellent Spa  Mediocre To Disappointing Food  Worn And Dated Interior In Many Places.,,,,,
,2095,Pool Was Fantastic And Good To Have Child-Free Times,,,,,
,2096,We Enjoyed All The Little Touches Like The Homemade Biscuits In The Lovely Tea Boxes  The Fudge And The Presentation Of The Shower Products. This Was A Special Treat For My Sons Graduation  I Had Never Stayed In A U.K 5Star Hotel Before And It Did Not Disappoint  So Thank You.,,,,,
,2101,Thank You So Much For Having Us.  Sally  Thank You For Making It Extra Special (And Affordable) To Us During Our Challenging Months! (Please If I Can Provide A Testimonial/Piece For Your Marketing - Just Ask),,,,,
,2102,This Is Not My Typical 5-Star Experience As I Know It From Asian Or Swiss Resorts (Extreme Attention To Detail  Extreme Guest Orientation) But I Was Actually Happy Not To Encounter This Perfection And Rather Have A More Casual  'Home' Feeling. After Some Hours In The Hotel  With All Its Squeaks  Rattles And Little Faults  Itr Felt Like Home. And This Relaxed Feeling Would Not Have Been Possible If The Hotel Had Decided To Become Perfectionist.  To Sum It Up: True Beauty Is Never Perfect. Stay That Way.,,,,,
,2103,I Love Bovey!,,,,,
,2104,Our Overall Experience Was Very Good And We Are Planning On A Return Visit (With Golf Clubs) In The Spring  For A Four Night Stay. The Only Bad Comments I Could Make  Is The General Condition Of The Upstairs Area. Carpets Stretched And Frayed. Our Room Number 8 Had Stains On The Carpet And The Bathroom Looked A Bit Shabby.,,,,,
,2107,Check Out Worked Extremely Well And The Team Did A Fantastic Job,,,,,
,2108,Just To Thank You And Your Staff For Making It A Wonderful Time.,,,,,
,2109,The Whole Ambience Was Delightful And The Staff Super Helpful And Friendly. If I Were To Make One Comment It Is That To Add A Blanket 12.5% To Everything On The Grounds That You Are Giving To Charities I Already Support On Guests' Behalf Is Naughty. Other Guests Commented On This As Well.,,,,,
,2113,Overall  An Excellent Experience. It Is Refreshing To Be Assisted By Staff Who Seem To Be Trained To Genuinely Start From The Perspective Of 'How Can I Assist The Guest' Rather Than 'We Don't Normally Do That' - A Bit Of Onsite Shooting To Note. You Have Definitely Gained A Repeat Customer As A Result - Many Thanks.,,,,,
,2114,Please Send Me Details Of Events And Menu Etc,,,,,
,2120,Superb Hotel We Will Stay Again,,,,,
,2122,My Thoughts Are That Of The Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger When He Said  'I'll Be Back'  ,,,,,
,2125,The Bedrooms Are Badly In Need Of Refurbishment.,,,,,
,2126,Special Offes Adn Events Are Not Well Publicized - Eg Wine Tastings  Purple Experience - Why Aren't The Details Emailed Out To The Mailing List?,,,,,
,2129,As The Weather Was Poor During Our Stay We Will Back To View The Estate Walks And Have Afternoon Tea On The Terrace.,,,,,
,2130,We Were On A Meal And Wine Package For Our Stay But It Was Not Explained On The First Night Dining That The Wine Choice Was Limited To Four Selections From The Wine List  We Opted For Wine Which Incurred An Unexpected Additional Charge On Checkout. Overall A Very Enjoyable Experience. Highlights Were The Falconry Display  The Building And Grounds And Staff Friendliness.,,,,,
,2131,An Old Style 'Grand' Hotel - There Are Few Left. Avoidance Of Treating You As Someone Who Would Not Know How To Stay In A Luxury Hotel Which Is An Annoying Habit Of Some Places Who Spend Most Of The Time 'Teaching' You Their Systems With Which You Are Meant To Be Very Impressed. Here (As My Guest Commented) It Felt Like An Hotel From Another Era. The Key Quality You Have Is Professionalism.,,,,,
,2133,It Was Difficult To Find The Hotel Without Satnav. There Are No So Many Indications,,,,,
,2135,Thank You For A Lovely Stay.,,,,,
,2136,Federico Made A Very Special Effort To Resolve Our Bistro Problems. He Even Drove Us Down To North Bovey The Next Night. More Federicos Please! There Was A Very Nice Elder Blond Lady Who Was Attentive To Us - Helping With Bags  Valuables Etc..- When She Could See We (My Wife!) Was Frustrated At Not Being Able To Check In.  Other Comment: We Were Aware Of Major Breakfast Queue Issues On The Sat Am  But We Got Down Ion The Nick Of Time And It Didnt Affect Us.,,,,,
,2137,We Loved The Fact There Were So Many Little Corners  Sofas And Areas To Sit And Hang Out/Chill. This Was Exactly What We Were Looking For  And We Were Very Comfortable. Our Little Baby Was Able To Move Around Too - The Setting Of The Room Made This Very Possible. It Was Just Lovely.   Overall We Had A Lovely Time And Would Certainly Recommend It To Others.,,,,,
,2138,Thank You Once Again For A Wonderful Stay And We Will Be Back,,,,,
,2139,An Extremely Relaxing And Enjoyable Stay,,,,,
,2140,Overall We Had A Lovely Stay And My Little Sister Who Stayed With Me Absolutely Loved It So Thank You. The Suggested Improvements Are Merely Honest Feedback That I Think Would Make The Hotel Absolutely Perfect. Please Thank The Staff And Wish Them A Happy New Year.,,,,,
,2141,We Were Awoken By A Fire Alarm At 9.30Pm Which Lasted For At Least A Minute. When We Rang Reception To See If We Were To Evacuate  3 Times Without Receiving An Answer  We Gave Up. No One On Reception Rang Our Room Or Personally Knocked On The Door To Assure Us That There Was Nothing Wrong... This Was Unusual,,,,,
,2144,The Only Downside Was On Checking Our Bill On The Way Home We Found We Had Service Charge Added To 'Everything'  Even Down To Buying An Ice Cream Or A Coffee. I Never Mind Tipping Anyone For What They Do But Not For Putting Ice Cream Into A Cone. We Were Told About It When We Had Treatments  Which Was Fine But Also Added On To The Childrens Activites Too. !!!!!!,,,,,
,2145,We Had A Very Enjoyable Stay And I Took The Opportunity To Propose To My Girl Friend Who Said Yes  Hopefully We Would Like To Get Married In 2013 And Would Consider Bovey Castle As A Venue. We Were Thoroughly Well Looked After And Fedrico Did A Splendid Job In Looking After Our Week End. The Visist Was Probably The Best Visit So Far. We Are Actually Coming Back On Thursday To Discuss Wedding Details  Yikes !,,,,,
,2146,Rose Cottage Is Very Well Equipped But We Could Not Find Any Salad Servers!,,,,,
,2147,Some Minor Defects In Bathroom Which Need Some Attention. Mould Around Window  Loose Shower Control And Marked Wall Paper By Mirror. Of No Concern To Myself But Might Be Noticed By Somebody More Fussy,,,,,
,2148,We Will Not Leave It So Long To Return Again  As Our Stay Was Very Relaxing And Just What We Both Needed. Thank You Very Much.,,,,,
,2150,The Falconry Display And Archinedes At The Front Desk Were Absolutely Unique Touches And Made The Hotel Very Special Indeed. Thank-You For Having Us!,,,,,
,2151,We Have Stayed In The Hotel Once And Rose Cottage Two Years Running. Some Of The Furnishings In Rose Cottage Could Benefit From A Good Spring Clean And The Down Stairs Carpets Are Looking Tired And Grubby. On The Plus Side The Cottage Is Extremly Well Equipped And Moving The Washing Machine Into The Property Resolved The Issue Of Frozen Pipes Experienced Last Year. Minor Faults Were Reported Re The Shower Room And The Front Outside Light Needed A New Bulb. We Experienced Problems On Two Occasions With The Boiler Tripping Out But On Each Occasion Your Maintence Man Was Very Pleasant To Deal With.,,,,,
,2153,We Loved Our Time At Bovey Castle Thank You!,,,,,
,2157,Apart From That The Hotel Was Excellent!,,,,,
,2158,Ps-A Small Younger Woman At Front Desk Was Very Chatty And Kind.  Wish We Could Go Back And Give The Weekend A Rewind Or Have Gone At A Slower Time.,,,,,
,2160,Excellent Stay Thank You And We Will Be Back!,,,,,
,2161,Wonderful Ground  Amazing Staff.,,,,,
,2162,I Recommended My Brother John Aspinwall To You.  He Lives In The Us And Is Staying Soon.,,,,,
,2163,Would Like To Stay Longer Next Time,,,,,
,2165,We Absolutely Loved The Falconry Display  As Did Everyone Else.  It Was Fascinating  Entertaining  Well Presented - And Well Organised.,,,,,
,2166,We Cannot Answer Questions 25 & 26 Properly  As We Were Treated.,,,,,
,2167,On The Sunday We Ordered A Â£40 Picnic For Four Together With Drinks.  We All Considered That The Price Of Â£40 Per Person For The Food Was Very High For What We Actually Had.  The Total Food Bill Was Â£160  Whereas The Value Of The Food Provided We Estimated At No More Than Â£40.  The 'Mark Up' Therefore  We Considered To Be High.    Despite This We Did Enjoy The Picnic.,,,,,
,2168,We Enjoyed Very Much The Walks That Were Described In The Booklet Given To Us By The Young Lady On Reception. She Was Also Very Helpful In Making Suggestions As To Places To Visit. We Also Enjoyed Very Much The Falcon Display.,,,,,
,2169,Unfortunately The Falconry Display Was Cancelled After Being Advertised On A Leaflet In The Bedroom For The Following Day (And Also Online).  We Rushed Breakfast In Time To Catch The Display At 10.00Am And Were Only Told That It Had Been Cancelled When We Approached Reception At 10.15Am.  All 6 Of Us Were Very Disappointed.,,,,,
,2171,My Expectations Were Not Exceeded  Only Because We Had High Expectations Of Bovey! :-),,,,,
,2172,The Service At Bovey Castle Is Exceptional.  We Will Definitely Be Returning.,,,,,
,2173,We All Can't Wait To Come Back Soon To See Those Magnificent Views Again And Would Love To Stay In One Of The Family Lodges With Our Parents. We Also Loved The Falconry Display That Was Put On Each Morning  What A Nice Additional Surprise  My Children  Especially My Son  Loved Watching It And Still Keeps Talking About The Birds He Saw At The Hotel.  Thank You For Making Our Stay So Special.,,,,,
,2175,The Food Is Disappointing. Sack The Chef! I Thought After 3 Visits It Would Have Got Better. I'd Rather Eat At The Ring Of Bells Next Time!,,,,,
,2176,We Loved The Hunting Bird Presentation. Great Fun!,,,,,
,2177,Loved All The Birds!! If You Ever Want To Expand Your Collection I Keep Peach Faced Lovebirds Who Liove Up To Their Name Soii Am Frequently Looking For New Homes For The Young Ones. Do Contact Me If You Would Like Some. (No Charge-Just Assurance Of A Good Home).,,,,,
,2179,Looking Forward To Spending More Time At Bovey And Working Closely With A Great Team .,,,,,
,2181,Only One Critisism In An Overall Lovely Overnight Stay. My Mother's Muffin Served With Her Eggs Benedict Was Practically Cremated And Shouldn't Have Been Allowed To Go Out On The Plate. We Didn't Complain Because Everything Else Was So Good.,,,,,
,2182,We Will Come Back Soon Thank You And Well Done,,,,,
,2183,It Would Be Nice To Have The House Details In The Room  Reception Did Provide This When We Enquired About The History.,,,,,
,2189,You Should Take The Shades Off The Beautiful Chandeliers In The Dining Room. I Know You Are Known For Your Afternoon Teas But When You Are Not Fully Booked Why Do You Have All The Tables Reserved For Afternoon Teas? When You Have Checked In And Maybe Would Like To Sit In One Of The Rooms You Feel That You Can Not As They All Have Reserved On Them And Are Laid Up For Tea. Having Said That On Our Departure There Were A Couple Of Tables Not Laid Up Which Made You Feel You Could Use The Lounges To Relax Chat And Read. We Have Stayed 3 Times Between August And October And Each Time It Has Been The Same.,,,,,
,2192,Thank You!,,,,,
,2195,The Location And Good Weather Certainly Enhanced Our Experience.  The Uniform Of The Staff Was Very Much In Keeping With How One Images Styles Of Former Times But Not Too Ostentatious To Spoil It All.  Just The Right Balance To Make 'Everyone' Feel Welcome.,,,,,
,2197,Would Like To Repeat!,,,,,
,2198,Thank You So Much For All That You Did.,,,,,
,2200,Big Thanks To All The Bar Staff For Keeping Me Topped Up All Night And Morning!!!,,,,,
,2202,Just That It Was A Special Time For Us And Even The Weather Was Wonderful We Shall Remember It Always Thankyou.,,,,,
,2208,Do Not Frederico Send Me These Silly Surveys When You Already Know The Answers,,,,,
,2211,No,,,,,
,2214,We Love Beaky! Good Funny! The Pianist Was Amazing Too!,,,,,
,2219,Your Staff Are Fantastic  Everyone Was So Happy And Helpful.,,,,,
,2228,For A Moment It Was Like Stepping Back To The 1900'S And Being Treated With The Politeness And Courtesy Of That Time (As I Would Imagine It To Be). It Was Wonderful. We Loved The Staff Uniform And The Extra Touches Such As Having Your Car Parked  Bags Taken To And From Your Room And Real Tea At The Breakfast Table.,,,,,
,2232,Overall A Very Relaxing Stay,,,,,
,2233,The Piano Playing Enhanced The Relaxed Atmosphere. .....Very Good.,,,,,
,2234,Thank You To The Reception Staff Who Made It Possible For My Husband To Purchase The Earrings I Admired In Your Cabinet  After Our Departure. I Am Delighted With Them.,,,,,
,2236,Nibbles With Pre Dinner Drinks Would Have Been Nice.  We Have Experienced This Numerous Times And Does Make The Pre Dinner Drink A Little Bit Special When On Occasions We Have Had Some Varied Nibbles.,,,,,
,2239,The Service Provided By Your Team Was Fantastic  We Are Fortunate To Have Stayed And Eaten In Some Of The Best Hotels In The Uk And Around The World  The Overall Experience At Bovey Was A Match For Many Of These Establishments,,,,,
,2241,No,,,,,
,2242,No,,,,,
,2243,Pity You Con't Do Anything About The Mobile Telephone Reception,,,,,
,2249,No. There Are No Improvements I Could Suggest. We Were Delighted With Our Stay.,,,,,
,2251,Personal Falconery Experience Excellent. Expã©Rience Enhanced By The Excellent And Detailed Knowledge Of The Falconer And His Most Personable Approach.  Staff Attended Excellently To Specific Requests  Which Made My Wife's Birthday Surprise A Memorable Experience.,,,,,
,2252,Would Like To Have Known Who Owned The Hotel. Peter De Savary Was The Last Owner We Knew Of!! Loved The Log Fires.  (Can Use Any Of This On Line But Without A Name),,,,,
,2255,I Know It Sounds Fussy  But Some Of The Common Parts Are Starting To Show Wear And Tear,,,,,
,2257,Please Let Me Know If You Change Your Policy Over Loud Children And Improove Your Menu As We Would Like To Return But Feel This Trip Was A Let Down To Previous Stay As Such We Shall Not Return For At Least A Year Do To Our Disatisfaction,,,,,
,2258,The Receptionist Staff Were Very Polite & And Very Helpful With Regards To A Walk Out On The Saturday Morning. The Falconry Display Was Very Entertaining.,,,,,
,2259,A Few Outside Wicker Sofas Would Be Nice   Maybe Under Some Trees With Some Rugs . We Don't All Want To Sit On Concrete When You Hacpve Such Lovely Scenery,,,,,
,2260,I'll Come Again Probably For Morning Coffee Or Afternoon Tea And We'll Bring Friends. It's Also Somewhere A Bit Special Where You Can Be Pampered But In A Surroundings Large Enough To Find Your Own Space. (Something You Can't Do At Gidley Park.) If I Can Put Business Your Way I Will. Well Done Guys!,,,,,
,2262,Fantastic Stay  Really Enjoyed The Falcon Display As Well. Hope To Come Again Soon!,,,,,
,2263,Everything Was Excellent We Really Couldn't Fault Anything At All. Our Friends' Wedding Was Perfect  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For The Staff And Federico And Leah Were Just Brilliant.,,,,,
,2264,We Loved Staying At Bovey Castle. It Was The Best Holiday Ever And We Really Enjoyed Our Honeymoon!!,,,,,
,2268,Disappointed No Falconry Display Due To Low Numbers In The Hotel,,,,,
,2270,We Had An Amazing Time Whilst At Bovey Castle And We Have Strongly Recommended It To Many Of Our Friends. We Would Love To Come Back Again Soon.,,,,,
,2271,Daily Falconry Display A Highlight. Staff Excellent Overall Despite Some Hiccups. Our Bathroom Needed To Be Brought Up To Date.,,,,,
,2273,Dog Bed/Basket Provided Was Filthy Which Can Easily Be Washed,,,,,
,2274,We Enjoyed Our Stay Immensely And Will Absolutely Be Back. Thank You To Federico And All The Staff For Their Freindliness And Professionalism.,,,,,
,2283,Great Manager  Staff And Altogether A Lovely Place To Be  Thankyou For A Great Week.,,,,,
,2284,A Wonderful Experience. I Have Stayed In Some Great Hotels Over The Last Few Years But I Have To Say That Bovey Castle Is As Good As Any And Better Than Most.  It Is A Fantastic Hotel With Great Staff And A Wonderful Relaxed Feel Abut It. It Doesn't Get Better Than That In My Opinion.,,,,,
,2285,We Tried Clay Pigeon Shooting For The First Time  And We Thoroughly Enjoyed It. The Instructor Was Professional But Friendly And Good Fun. The Daily Falconry Display Was A Great Perk. Amazing Birds Introduced By A Great Character. We Look Forward To Our Next Stay.,,,,,
,2287,The Hotel Grounds And Property Were Well Kept And Very Beautiful.,,,,,
,2288,Thank You,,,,,
,2291,We Had Such A Lovely Stay At This Hotel. It Was Relaxed And Chilled Out With A Lovely Atmosphere. I Don't Usually Feel Sad To Leave A Place After A Holiday  But In This Case I Did. I Really Hope We Get To Come Back One Day. Thank You For A Really Lovely Few Days.,,,,,
,2292,Fedrico Was Brilliant And Very Attentative.,,,,,
,2301,Good Hotel But Better Service Would Make It Better.,,,,,
,2306,A Very Pleasant And Enjoyable Stay And I Will Be Returning With My Husband At Some Time In The Not Too Distant Future.,,,,,
,2308,Great Night,,,,,
,2309,We Loved The Fudge And Homemade Biscuits Delivered To Our Room In The Evening.,,,,,
,2310,We Were Very Surprised To See A 5% Service Charge On The Final Bill  Don't Quite Understand Why This Was On There??,,,,,
,2312,We Had A Very Relaxed Stay. The Room Was Much Better Than The Previous One. My Main Comment Is That I Am Not Sure I Would Have Been Prepared To Pay Â£600 Per Night For The Room. Overall The Prices Are Over The Top And You Charge Too Many Extras On Top Such As Internet Access And Room Services Delivery Charge Of Â£5.,,,,,
,2313,My Only Complaint Was How Hideously Expensive The Activities Were...We Have 3 Children And It Would Have Cost Us Almost Â£100 For Them To All Do One Activity Which Is Ridiculous (We Have Stayed In Plenty Of Similar Hotels And Never Paid Anything Like That For Activities)  Had They Been More Reasonably Priced They Would Have Done A Lot More,,,,,
,2314,I Will Return With Family And Dog.  Perfect For Us.,,,,,
,2317,Would Love To Visit At Some Stage In The Future For Pleasure!,,,,,
,2318,I Look Forward To Returning With My Wife For An Even More Relaxing Visit  Without Any Work This Time!,,,,,
,2320,We Loved Our Stay Due To The View And Gardens  Very Dissapointed With Our Room Due To The Poor Bathroom  As We Had Chosen A Package With An Upgrade From Classic And Then Lucy Had Very Kindly And Professionally Offered An Additional Upgrade As We Had A Bad Experience And Were Coming Away To Forget That.,,,,,
,2321,We Booked Through Travelzoo And If A Similar Offer Became Available We Would Definitely Book To Come Again.,,,,,
,2326,Please Keep Us Informed Of Special Family Offers So We Can Come More Often.,,,,,
,2327,See Comments On Noise Insulation On 3Rd Floor.  Would Expect Knowledge From Reception/Reservations To Advise Accordingly  Although We Have Stayed In A Classic Room On A Previous Occasion On The First Floor And Had No Problems At All.  Sound Proofing Was So Bad  We Probably Had 2-3 Hours Sleep Maximum On Saturday Evening,,,,,
,2329,Overall  We Had A Very Relaxing Stay And Our Dog Was Very Well Received. An Improvement In The Spa Area And An Improved Ambience In The Bistro Would Increase Our Review From 9/10 To 10/10.,,,,,
,2330,No,,,,,
,2332,I Have Two Comments Regarding The Check Out.  First  There Was An Error On The Bill (Ironically  I Was Charged For The Pick-Up From The Train Station Which Had Not Been Arranged).  Second  The Person Who Was Assisting In The Check-Out Did Not Know How To Manage The Dial-Up Confirmation Process When The Machine Noted That A Confirmation From The Bank Was Required.  All That Said  We Very Much Enjoyed Our Stay At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,2336,I Have Been Very Candid In These Criticisms  But I Do Not Wish To Leave The Impression That We Were Disappointed With Our Stay. The Hotel Is Magnificent  The Location Absolutely Beautiful  And The Staff Were Generally Very Friendly And Helpful. We Enjoyed Our Few Days Very Much.,,,,,
,2337,I Have Stayed At Bovey Castle Many Times As Part Of A Golf Party. This Was My First Experience With My Wife As A Treat. I Really Do Appreciate That The Standards Are Superb But On Getting My Final Account I Was Surprised That Surcahrges Are Applied To Everything  Drinks At The Bar  Accomodation   Meals. I Dont Think This Was Explained To Me Prior To My Stay Or I May Have Missed Something When Booking.,,,,,
,2338,Very Disappointing And A Real Waist Of Â£1100 For Two Days. We Had Lunch At A Hotel Nearby Called The Mill End And We Wished We Stayed There. Won't Be Recommending Or Returning.,,,,,
,2340,None,,,,,
,2342,We Have Stayed In Many Hotels - Relais And Chateau - And This Was Equally As Good  We Were Really Made To Feel Special And The Hotel Has A Real Atmosphere And Warmth And You Don't Get That Everywhere.,,,,,
,2344,Amy In The Grill Was Very Good,,,,,
,2345,It Was A Truly Wonderful  Relaxing And Fun Holiday.  We Look Forward To Returning.,,,,,
,2346,We Do Think That Adding Discretionary Service Charges To All Things Such As Bovey Rangers  Baby Sitting Etc Is Excessive Given Your Charges Are Very High.  We Do Think Your Charges For The Creche  Bovey Rangers And Baby Sitting Are Excessive. We Are Convinced The Uptakefor These Things Would Be Greater At A More Reasonable Charge.  We Would Have Used Both These Services More If The Cost Could Be More Realistic. Â£32 For 1.5 Hours With A Child In A Group Activity Seems Excessive And Is A Shame.  However  The Staff Going Through The Bill Was Very Happy To Take Off Those Discretionary Charges We Did Not Want To Pay,,,,,
,2347,The Bird Display Was Fantastic. The Hotel Public Rooms Were Stunning & Amazing With Beautiful Furniture  Lovely To See.,,,,,
,2348,This Is A Lovely Place To Bring A Dog  We Felt We Were Welcomed As Dog Owners  Rather Than Just Tolerated. But The Dog Rules Need To Be More Consistent And Enforced. I Was Amazed To Come Upon A Dog Wandering In The Grounds Totally Unsupervised  When I Thought That They Were Required To Be On Leads. The Grounds Continue To Be Spectacular  And The Pre Arrival Assistance Was Outstanding,,,,,
,2351,Really Only To Say About Our Disappointment With The Bistro .. Due To A Large Golf Event It Was Very Busy And Noisy.  It Was Quite A Slow Service In The Oak Room & My Husband Wanted A Pint Of Beer So It Was Quicker To Get The Drinks Ourselves In The Bistro  So On Top Of Having To Queue The Prices Where Quite A Surprise  Then With Added Service Charge Felt A Bit Cheeky! However We Did Pay The Discretionary Service Charge Purely Because The Service We Had On The Edwardian Bistro Deserved It.,,,,,
,2354,Everything Was Perfect Thank You Very Much For This Wunderful Holiday,,,,,
,2356,I Work In The Bed Trade And Although The Bed Was Comfortable I Did See It Was A Sprung Slumber Bed And That Indicates It Is Quite Old As They Went Out Of Business Several Years Ago ( A Colleague Of Mine Worked For Them) . I Am A Freelance Sales Agent Working For Two Bed Manufacturers   Gainsborough  And Sleepshaper/Mammoth And Would Be Happy To Help You With The Supply And Installation Of New Products When You Are Reviewing Your Beds Next . Please Ont Hesitate To Contact Me If I Can Help In Any Way . Thak You For An Excellent Stay !  Knd Regards Neil Kirpatrick,,,,,
,2357,A Wonderful Hotel That I Would Love To Bring My Wife To But I Am Afraid It Would Be Too Expensive.,,,,,
,2358,Fabulous Stay,,,,,
,2359,No Thank You,,,,,
,2360,Upgrade Decorations At Some Rooms  I Understand That We Might Have A Not Upgrade One And Train Your Staff Professionally. Willing To Help But Not Trained Enough For Their Job. I Am An Architect Working With Hotels In Uk And Greece For 15 Years Now.,,,,,
,2361,You Have A Wonderful Hotel And I Hope You Will Retain The Excellent Standards For When We Will Return. Please Will You Thank All Your Staff For Making Our Stay So Special.,,,,,
,2362,Very Impressed With Dog Welcome And Facilities And Particurlarly Enjoyed The Falconry Display.  Would Be Interested To Find Out Prices For Holiday Cottages In Grounds.,,,,,
,2364,We Were Overcharged By Â£50 (Someone Else's Bar Bill!). However  We Were Not Questioned When We Challenged This And The Money Was Taken Straight Off The Bill Without Hesitation. Finally  It Would Have Been Nice To Ask If We Wanted To Upgrade Our Room - Even If It Was Just For One Night?,,,,,
,2365,I Was Really Impressed With The Hotel  As Was My Husband. I Was So Impressed That The Company Looked After Its Staff As Well As It Did. I Thought The Idea Of A Service Charge To Reward All Staff Was An Excellent Idea. We Never Normally Return To Places We Have Stayed And Have Enjoyed So Much  The Second Time Can Sometimes Be An Anti-Climax  But We May Make An Exception Now.,,,,,
,2366,Our Two Boys  Harrison And Oliver Really Enjoyed The Bovey Rangers Acitivities That Were Organised.  It Mum And Dad Some Time To Chill And Our Own Space. Thank You!,,,,,
,2368,Overall A Good Break But The Food Let It Down,,,,,
,2369,We Discussed The Concept Of The 12.5% Tip On Everything And We Just Feel This Is The Wrong Approach For A Hotel Like Bovey Castle To Take. We Believe This Should Be Shown As An Option On The Final Bill  And It Will Be Added On Agreement At The End Of Your Stay  Rather Than Taken Away If You Request It To Be Taken Away. It Is Extremely Uncomfortable To Ask For It To Be Removed When In Our Situation Other Guests Are At Reception And You Feel Extremely Awkward  And I Am Sure This Is Not What You Want To Do.,,,,,
,2372,We Thought Breakfast Was Excellent And Great Value - Very Surprised That It Was Not Incorporated Into Room Price  (As Were Other Guests That We Overheard At Breakfast And At Reception). Surely An Extra Â£10-15 Pounds On Room Price Would Not Really Be An Issue To Your Average Guest And Would Overcome This Problem??,,,,,
,2374,Really Enjoyed Our Stay But For A Five Star Hotel And The Prices Charged It Needs To Be Better.,,,,,
,2377,I Thoroughly Enjoyed My Staff And Will Be Making Recommendations To Friends And Family And Look Forward To Visiting Again In The Very Near Future.,,,,,
,2380,Loved Every Minute Of Our Stay Will Be Back For Sure,,,,,
,2381,I Am Looking Forward To Returning With A Few Couples And  Again  Will Use One Of The Lodges.,,,,,
,2382,I Think A Seperate Charge -- And Consequent Procedure -- For Wifi Access Is Anachronistic These Days And Charging By The Hour Etc Feels Penny-Pinching In The Context Of A Weekend Stay Costing Well Over A Thousand Pounds And Thus Detracted Disproportionately From The Overall Experience.,,,,,
,2383,We Have Now Stayed Four Times In A Lodge And Have Loved It Every Time. We Love To Be Independent But Also To Be Able To Enjoy The Bars  Restaurants And Pool At The Hotel. Thank You For Another Lovely Stay.,,,,,
,2385,We Stayed In Ingle Tor Lodge.  There Were Only Two Saucepans And No Oven Gloves  But Otherwise It Was Well Equiped.  The Clean Tea Towels Were Left In The Cupboard Under The Kitchen Sink Resting On A Dustpan And Brush - Did Not Use Them For This Reason.,,,,,
,2387,The Castle Is Stunning And We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,
,2389,It Was A Fantastic Holiday And We Cannot Wait To Return.,,,,,
,2390,The Morning Falconry Was A Beautiful Touch,,,,,
,2391,I Felt It Was Unfair To Have The 5% Discretionary Service Charge Added To The Final Invoice Before Asking The Client. The Meals Which Were Included In The Price Of The Accomodation Also Had The Service Charge Added. It Should Be The Customer's Choice To Leave A Tip If Appropiate.,,,,,
,2396,As We Said Earlier Perhaps Some New Thoughts On The Bistro...,,,,,
,2400,A Safe In The Lodge Would Have Been Good Activities Very Expensive But Used Them Some Vouchers For Archery And Other Activities Would I Believe Encourage More Guests To Try And Rebook Again E,,,,,
,2401,Despite The Internet Issue  My Wife And I Had A Lovely Weekend. Thank You Team Bovey Castle!,,,,,
,2402,Bovey Castle Is Definitely One Of The Best Hotels We Have Ever Stayed In And We Were Extremely Impressed With Our Lodge. We Felt Instantly At Home And Were Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,2403,It Is So Nice To Stay At A Hotel Where The Manager Is Always So Visible And Effective.,,,,,
,2404,It Was A Real Pleasure To Meet Such Friendly Staff And Be Made To Feel So Welcome In That Magnificent Classical Building. We Will Be Back Sometime In April/ May Next Year!! We Have Already Been Looking At The Web Site ? For Spring Offers!,,,,,
,2407,The First Person To Enquire About Our Stay Was The Manager As He Carried Our Bags To The Car  One Being Told Of Our Issues Offered His Card And Asked Us To Email Him If/When We Came Back And He Would Ensure That We Were Looked After.  So We At Least Left On A Positive Note.,,,,,
,2408,Once Again We Had A Wonderful Time At Bovey Castle And Will Be Returning  Thank You To Frederico And His Staff A Most Professional Team,,,,,
,2409,Overall A Very Pleasant Stay At Bovey Which We Enjoyed.  The Falconer Was A Nice Touch And Very Amusing.,,,,,
,2410,Lovely Grounds  Beautiful Hotel And High Quality Lodge  Enjoyed The Pool  Falconry And Tennis  Some Of The Group Also Used The Gym,,,,,
,2412,From Discussion In The Sauna Among 4 People - We Had All Arrived At The Pool Area Knowing The Access Code But Without Glasses. 2 Of Us Were Let In By Someone Else Arriving Around The Same Time And 2 Of Us Had To Go Back To Our Rooms And Fetch Glasses. We Thought - Given The Likely Client Profile - That We Would Not Be The Only Ones Who Experienced This And That A Small Magnifying Glass Attached To The Door Handle To See The Keys For The Code Would Be Very Helpful.  Particularly Liked The Fair & Transparent Gratuity Policy.,,,,,
,2415,On The Sunday Night We Went To The Pub And My Guest Preferred That To The Oak Room Which Disappointed Me As The Ladies Like To Dress Up For Dinner.....But Next Time Its Not On The Agenda. Sorry But Better To Be Honest,,,,,
,2416,All Staff Were Consistent In Delivering Excellent Customer Service,,,,,
,2417,Whist I Understand That On The Odd Occasion Any Establishment Can Be Caught Out  I Do Feel That For A 5* Establishment The Previously Metioned Items Should Not Have Happened Hence My Overall Disappointment In What We Hoped Would Be A Luxurious Break.   ,,,,,
,2418,Offer Guests Who Have The Abilty To Give You Helpful Feedback A Substantial Discount To Return!!!,,,,,
,2419,We Will Be Back  Perhaps For A Mid Week Break In Feb  The Week After Valentines,,,,,
,2421,No,,,,,
,2422,A Most Enjoyable Weekend.  Thank You To All The Staff At The Bovey Hotel.,,,,,
,2426,Bovey Castle Was Just Beautiful  From The Wonderful Interiors To The Stunning Landscape.  There Was Plenty Of Choice For Breakfast And Dinner In The Edwardian Restaurant Was Very Grand And Of A High Quality.  The Service In The Bistro Restaurant Needs To Be More Attentive.  This Was A Very Special Stay For Our 30Th Wedding Anniversary And We Would Love To Return Again.  The Falconry Display Was Very Informative And Great Fun.,,,,,
,2427,The Location Is Great But The Service Seems To Need Better Organisation / Direction.,,,,,
,2429,Staff At Breakfast Were Not As Efficient As Others.,,,,,
,2431,I Was Dissapointed That You Chose To Add Service Charges To Each Visit To Every Eating/Drinking Venue. Just Another Way Of Taking More Money From Guests. Charging For Internet Access  Most Hotels Are Free These Days!! Superb Location And Fabulous Staff  Just Upset With The Hidden Charges,,,,,
,2432,I Expect Our Experience With The Food And Heating Were An Unfortunate Blip Which Happen In Most Organisations But Were Very Disappointing For Us. We Think That The Hotel  Facilities  Courses And Grounds Were Amazing And Certainly Lived Up To Our Expectations. We Thought About Mentioning These Points To Reception On Checkout But As There Were Others Also Waiting To Leave  We Decided To Grin And Bear It On This Occasion. So This Accounts For A Mixed  Review On The Previous Tick Boxes!,,,,,
,2434,We Had A Lovely  Relaxing Time And Would Love To Visit Again. Next Time We May Try Out The Edwardian Restaurant.,,,,,
,2437,Our Friends Made The Reservation With Travelzoo And It Is Shame That We Can't Book Direct With Yourselves At Similar Rates  Because We Would Have Liked To Stay Another Night But It Wasn't Possible At The Same Rate.   Please Convey Our Appreciation To Your Staff.,,,,,
,2438,Very Good Other Than Comment Re Heating In The Bedroom & The Dinner. Hotel & Staff V Good,,,,,
,2439,I Think A Little More Attention To Small Detail Would Be Good In The Restaurant. The Staff Were All Very Nice But Did Not Seem Well Organised Even At Breakfast. Things Like No Salt & Pepper On Table And Asking For Butter Should Not Arise. Saw Meals Delivered To The Wrong Table Also. Not A Complaint As It Did Not Spoil Our Experience But Just An Observation From A Business Perspective,,,,,
,2441,We Thought The Bar Was Very Nice  Very Friendly Efficient Staff. We Have Since Heard Your Afternoon Tea Is Extremely Good  We Will Be Back !,,,,,
,2443,It Really Was Excelent  And We Would Love To Come Back At Some Stage  There Is Still So Much To Do And As Walkers So Much More To See. If The Price Was Right I Am Sure We Will Be Back,,,,,
,2444,We Had Guests Joining Us For Dinner  And Requested Menus Without Prices For Them From Which To Make Their Choices. This Was Done Without Fuss. We Were Very Pleased With Your Response.,,,,,
,2445,We Loved It And Are Playing The Euro Lottery This Weekend To Try And Buy The Castle If We Win. We Dont Normally Play So You Can See How Much We Loved The Utter Peace We Found At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,2446,Yes - We Came And Stayed With You Earlier This Year And Were Not Impressed With The Staff Or The Accommodation.  Not Because It Was Bad  Merely Uncomfortable.  The Staff Were Unhappy And It Came Across In Their Manner. Not Relaxing.  The Difference This Time Was Quite Incredible.  It Was Professional  Invisible  Charming And Efficient.  The New Manager Has A Quite Fantastic Attention To Detail And His Level Of Expectation On The Performance Of His Staff Appears To Us To Be Infectious.  Congratulations.    One Comment - The Water Could Be Hotter In The Bathrooms - Other Than That - Perfect.,,,,,
,2447,Just Brilliant Could Not Find Any Fault. Our 3Rd Christmas With You And Everything Was Perfect This Is The Best Place To Spend Christmas And Hope To Spend Many More!!!! A Special Mention To Fedrico As He Is The Most Amazing Manager And The Staff Are All Lovely.,,,,,
,2448,In The Nicest Possible Way  Something Was Missing! We Think  Some Parts Of  The Hotel Are Looking  Very Tired  And  Need Some Tlc,,,,,
,2449,Better Lighting In Bedrooms And More Socket Outlets Would Help (I Didn't Much Like Having A Boiling Kettle Bang Next To My Laptop  For Example). We Very Much Liked The Dark  Moody Interiors Of The Cathedral Room And Hallways.,,,,,
,2450,Without Doubt A Wonderfull Place For Children.The Use Of A Buggy Was A Masterstroke..I Got Lost On The Walk To North Bovey My Boy Scout Training Was Of No Use.Maybe A Couple Of Discreet Signs Would Help. Loved The Bar.,,,,,
,2454,Bovey Castle Was A Comfortable And Enjoyable Experience For Us. The Service People Were Very Attentive. We Think That Bovey Will Be In Our Future Travel Plans.,,,,,
,2455,Overall Presentation And Location Of The Hotel Is Very Good. Building Is In Need Of A Little Tlc In Some Areas But This Is Understandable With A Building In Excess Of 100 Years Old.,,,,,
,2457,Suggest Waste Bin In Bedroom For Tea Bags!,,,,,
,2460,The Only Criticism Is The Charge For Breakfast On Top Of Your Tariff When I Know This Can Be Waived !,,,,,
,2462,Had A Thoroughly Enjoyable Time At Bovey Castle.  The Grounds Were Wonderful And So Well Maintained  Just A Shame The Weather Didn't Allow For Us To Enjoy Them To The Full.  But Maybe Next Time  ......!,,,,,
,2468,Congratulations Bovey Castle!  You Succeeded In Giving Us A Wonderful Break. Thank You.,,,,,
,2471,We Were Not Shown Around And Found It Difficult To Find Anything,,,,,
,2475,An Absolutely Perfect 21St Weekend At Bovey Castle - All The Guests Were Stunned By The Setting And The Quality Of The Service And The Evening. All Of Us Staying With You Over The Weekend Had An Incredible Time And The Staff Could Not Have Been Any More Helpful. The Cleaning Team Who Helped Us Out In The Lodge Were Outstanding. We Could Not Have Asked For Much More! Thank You All!,,,,,
,2476,I Would Like To Thank You All For A Memorable Stay. Really Enjoyed It. The Hotel Is Stunning And It Was Only The Tiny Small Things That Turned It From And Excellent To A Very Good. Thank You For A Goregous 2 Nights At The Property.,,,,,
,2483,I Think Bovey Castle Is A Lovely Destination. I Like The Idea Of The Service Charge. However I Just Don't Think Bovey Castle Is Value For Money.,,,,,
,2484,The Castle Needs More Information As To Where Things Are  I Found Myself Wandering Around To Much Trying To Locate Places.,,,,,
,2485,Send The Staff To Stay In A 5* Hotel And Open Their Eyes To The Level Of Expected Service - I Don't Think They Even Realise What They're Doing Wrong At The Moment.,,,,,
,2487,My Children Loved The Falconry Display On The Sunday Morning At Breakfast. What A Wonderful Addition And Something That They Still Talk About. The Atmosphere Of The Hotel Was Welcoming And Friendly And This Is Not Easy To Achieve. A Fantastic Hotel That I Very Hope To Visit Again In The Future.,,,,,
,2488,It Is A Shame That The Children's Play Area Has Been Reduced To Just A Trampoline  And That The Playbarn Was Being Used To Store Furniture. The Lego Service Was A Tremendous Hit  But The Number Of Missing Pieces And/ Or Instructions Caused Some Disappointment.  Also  There Were Several Instances Of The Information In The Lodge Being Incorrect Eg Bbq Hire Price  Lodge Service Menu. These Are Trivial Things: We Had A Lovely Time And Will Be Back Again Soon.,,,,,
,2489,The Gym Facilities Could Be Improved,,,,,
,2490,Beautiful Venue In A Beautiful Part Of The World. I Think An Onsite Shop Would Benefit Guests Who Aren't Able To Drive To The Local Village And I Think The Dining Experience In The Hotel Needs Improving To Match The Other Elements Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,2491,Fed And Ashlie Are Great People - Went To All Levels To Make Our Day Truly Unbelievable!,,,,,
,2502,Will Be Writing A Letter Of Complaint,,,,,
,2505,Arrival Staff/Reception Staff Were Very Welcoming And Efficient. Standared Of Food Was High When It Arrived But Service Was Unprofessional At Times. Lovely Surroundings But Lack Of Staff/Training Hampered Our Enjoyment.,,,,,
,2506,My Partner And I Were Very Impressed With Our Stay At Bovey Castle. The Castle Was Beautifully Maintained And Had A Very Homely Feel. We Were Not As Impressed With The Decoration In The Edwardian Grill Or The New Castle Bistro  But Can Appreciate That Styles Change Over Time. The Staff And The Comfortable Surroundings Of The Hotel Were The Highlights  And I Am Certain That We Will Return In Future. The Archery  Swimming Pool  Spa And Birds Of Prey Display Ensured That We Did Not Need To Leave The Grounds Of The Hotel For The Whole Weekend. Keep Up The Good Work And Thanks For A Great Holiday.,,,,,
,2508,Despite The Issues With Our Stay  We Did Very Much Enjoy The Location  Atmosphere  Decor And Overall Experience Bovey Was Able To Offer And The Spa Was Exceptional. We Cannot Sadly Recommend To Friends Due To The Problems We Faced And Our Uncertainty That These Would Be Resolved On A Future Stay.,,,,,
,2510,I Would Like A Refund On The Service Charge And An Investigation Into The Missing Bag. It Is Clear That One Of Your Cleaning Team Has Stolen The Bag.,,,,,
,2512,The Swimming Pool Area Could Do With Someone Regularly Tidying Up. Towels Were Left Everywhere On The Sunbeds And The Female Changing Room Was A Mess. It Would Be Nice To Have Some Toiletries In The Changing Rooms Like Cotton Etc And Some Slippers.,,,,,
,2513,We Have Stayed At The Castle On Two Previous Occasions. We Love The Hotel And The Staff Are Always Helpful And Courteous. As Stated In The Previous Comments Box The Second Night Was Such A Disappointment And Obviously The Following Morning We Were All Very Tired And My Daughter Was Shattered. As A Family Booking We Should Of Not Been Placed Where We Were.,,,,,
,2514,It Was Lovely To Stay Somewhere With The Dogs And Feel So Relaxed Having Them In The Various Lounges And Even Behind Reception When We Had Lunch!  The Falconry Experience Was Excellent.,,,,,
,2518,The Hotel Is Beautiful - The Setting Awesome - But The Details Were Lacking  And I Say That As Someone Who Spends Over 200 Nights A Year In Luxury Hotels  As Well As Budget Hotels And Everything In Between.,,,,,
,2519,There Was One Inaccuracy On The Bill But It Was Rectified.,,,,,
,2521,The Location Is Lovely And We Did Have A Nice Stay But The Food In Particular Was Well Below My Expectations For A 5 Star And We Have Stayed In Many 4 Stars That Were Better Quality.,,,,,
,2523,Regarding The Final Accounts  There Were A Couple Of Issues: 1. Two Mistakes On Our Bills - We Were Charged With Things We Did Not Order 2. Difficult To Understand 3. We Paid For All Service Charges Shown On The Account - Were They Discretionary? It Is Not Stated Clearly,,,,,
,2524,Bovey & The Experience That You Get From This Hotel Is Like None Other.  It's Luxurious  Yet Very Relaxing And Laid Back.  You Really Do Feel Like You Are At Home.  This Is Thanks To All Who Work At Bovey Which Helps To Give It The Atmosphere To Be This Way.  Thank You To The Team.  A Great Job And We'll Look Forward To Staying Again In The Future  Both On Business And Pleasure.,,,,,
,2526,It Is A Lovely Venue And Could Get To An Exceptional Level  But Not Quite There For The Price Charged.  Went To Gidleigh Park For Lunch During Our Stay In Bovey And The Level Of Service And Comfort Was Exceptional - It Is Not That Much More Expensive.,,,,,
,2528,As We Said At The Time Of Departure You Must Ensure That The Bill Is Correct As We Were Almost Overcharged Â£120 Which I Am Not Happy About.  You Also Need To Ensure That If You Charge A Discretionary Service Charge On A Package Night Break You Do Not Charge It Again On The Total Meal Value As That Means You Tried To Charge Us Â£30 Instead Of Â£15 Which Again Is Completely Unacceptable.  I Do Wonder How Many People You Rip Off Because They Don't Notice These Things.,,,,,
,2532,Please Please Maintain Family Friendly Service And Atmosphere If New Ownership Comes In. A Crã¨Che Would Be Even Better!,,,,,
,2534,My Husband's Job Requires Him To Work Abroad And As Such He Lives Out Of Hotels For Much Of The Time.  We Both Agree That Bovey Castle Is The Best Hotel We Have Ever Stayed At And Is Always Our Preferred Choice For A Special Occasion.  I Treated My Parents To A Nights Stay Last Year As An Anniversary Gift And They Both Thought It Was Wonderful As Well.  Love The Golf  Spa  Food  Surroundings And Ambience. Staff Are Always Very Friendly And Helpful And Customer Service Is Excellent.,,,,,
,2535,Yes  I Have Recommended The Castle To My Parents And They Will Be Traveling To The Castle Within The Year,,,,,
,2538,The Owl On Reception Is Gorgeous  A Real Surprise.,,,,,
,2540,Generally The Decor In The Hotel Felt Tired And This Let Down The Experience. Carpets On Stairs Were Worn  Wall Paper In Bathroom Was Water Stained Etc. Staff Were Friendly And Professional Throughout The Hotel Which Lifted The Stay.,,,,,
,2543,Perhaps Have Some Music Playing In The Bar At Night While People Are Having Drinks (After Dinner) But Other Than A Few Comments Already Mentioned  We Have Nothing But Thanks To The Team At Bovey Castle For Making A 24 Hour Break Feel Like A 3 Day Holiday!,,,,,
,2547,Awesome Christmas Pudding Outfit!  See You Next Year,,,,,
,2550,Beautiful Facility And Unique! Would Love To Return!,,,,,
,2552,Beaky Didn't Seem Too Chipper - He Usually Chats With Me.,,,,,
,2554,Noisy Fan---Kitchen? Noisy Sat Night Antics In Yard - Sorted By Staff,,,,,
,2556,You Should Warn Guests That There Is Virtually No Mobile Phone Coverage. The Single Pay Phone Was Out Of Service During Our Visit,,,,,
,2557,Sad To Leave  Thank You For The Upgrade  It Was Most Appreciated.,,,,,
,2558,We Enjoyed The Falconry Displays They Were Interesting  Funny And Informative.  We Have Covered Our Other Comments In The Relevant Sections  We Feel Parts Of The Hotel Need Investment And Refurbishment To Bring The Whole Experience Up To A Five Star Experience.,,,,,
,2560,We Visit Different Hotels At Least Twice A Month And Do Not Feel That You Are Offering Five Star Service  Or Value. We Recently Stayed At A Hotel That Offered A Free Upgrade When We Checked In As They Were Quiet  Consequently We Have Booked To Stay Again.,,,,,
,2562,Probably The Best Uk Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In,,,,,
,2564,Disappointing No Falconry Demo Though It Was On The Daily Bulletin. No Table Tennis Available When We Asked.,,,,,
,2566,We Did Not Pick Up Our Car Key On Departure & It Took A Couple Of Phone Calls To Get Them Sent Back. However They Were Eventually Sent By Next Day Delivery.,,,,,
,2570,No,,,,,
,2572,No,,,,,
,2573,It Was Not Apparent That The Service Charge Was Discretionary  But We Would Have Paid It Anyway.,,,,,
,2575,No,,,,,
,2579,No,,,,,
,2581,None,,,,,
,2582,Two Items Of Room Maintenance/Bath Plug And Wardrobe Door Handle.Also There Was No Grab Handle For The Bath/Shower,,,,,
,2583,Lounge Smoky At Times,,,,,
,2584,Yes - One Blip On The Whole Weekend. On Returning To My Room After Berakfast I Found Your Staff In There Cleaning It Before I Had Checked Out!! I Wanted To Use The Bathroom And Asked The Girl To Leave But Found After That The Soap Had Been Taken So Nothing To Wash With!!!!!!!!! I Went Down To The Toilet On Ground Floor And Then Returrned To My Room To Find Her There Again!!!!!! I Was So Annoyed That I Didn't/Couldn't Use Teh Phone To Phoe Home As No Mobile Connection And I Left My Newspapers There As She Was In My Room Again!!!!!  I Found This Totally Unacceptable,,,,,
,2585,Even Though We Were In The Smallest And Cheapest Cottage Booked Thru' And Outside Agency  We Were Unexpectedly Delighted To Be Treated As An Esteemed Guest And We Would Definitely Think About Returning .,,,,,
,2591,Golf Shop Personnel Were Very Helpful Getting Me Fitted With Rental Clubs And Shoes.,,,,,
,2592,Fantastic!,,,,,
,2593,Only To Say Thank You Once Again,,,,,
,2594,A Great Shame That The Reception Staff Were Unable To Give Accurate Information On The Falconry Display. We Enquired Of Reception If The Display Was Taking Place And Its Location. We Arranged Our Breakfast Timing To Enable Me To Be ' In Place' For My Birthday Treat ( Raptors Are A Particular Passion Of Mine) And Were Then Informed By The Delightful 'Outdoor' Young Lady That It Was Not One Of The Falconer's Days. Disappointing  But Not Earth Shattering   But Our Hopes Would Not Have Been Raised If The Receptionist Had Given Us The Correct Information In The First Place. We Are Fortunate That Devon And Cornwall Have A Significant Number Of Exceptionally Good Hotels And Restaurants. We Are Familiar With Most Of Them And Revisit Some On A Number Of Occasions. We Are Proud To Take Guests From Other Parts Of The Country To Them. On This Occasion  We Wish That We Had Not Chosen Bovey Castle As The Venue For Meeting Friends From Lancashire To Celebrate My Birthday + 50 Years Of Friendship. It Was Simply Not Special Enough  And We Are Astounded By That As We Had High Expectations.  ,,,,,
,2596,Wonderful Place In All Respects.,,,,,
,2597,The Room Charge Was Included In The Bill Even Though I Had Pre-Paid The Booking Agent With This,,,,,
,2598,We Preferred In The Circumstances In Which The Hotel Finds Itself To Leave Individual Staff Gratuities Rather Than Pay The Discretionary Service Charge,,,,,
,2601,We Are Grateful To The Staff Who Helped My Husband Get Around On His Small Scooter And To Load And Unload It From The Car.,,,,,
,2602,The Building And Grounds Are Stunning And The Room Very Comfortable And Clean. The Reception Staff Are Very Friendly But The Restaurant Staff Seemed Not So Well Trained  Which Was Reflected In The Service (E.G. I Asked A Waiter Where The Ladies Room Was And He Didn't Know!),,,,,
,2603,Enjoyed The Sloe Gin Demonstration But Unable To Swim For The Rest Of The Day!,,,,,
,2609,Too Expensive And Not Good Value,,,,,
,2610,Poor Service...,,,,,
,2611,We Recommend The Motor Tour To Any Guest. It Takes You Through Many Different Landscapes And Leaves An Unforgettable Impression  Green Valleys And  Scant  And Scraggy Hill Tops  Rocks And A Lot Of Ponies  Sheep And Different Kinds Of Cattle,,,,,
,2614,It Was A Great Disappointment That Our Overall Experience At Bovey Was Not Good  However  Please Take My Comments Seriously As They Were Not Given To Score Points But As Constructive Criticism.  Again Best Of Luck For The Future.,,,,,
,2618,A Great Weeks Break .Thanks To All The Staff,,,,,
,2619,I Think You Get The Message.,,,,,
,2620,A Very Pleasent And Enjoyable Weekend Stay/,,,,,
,2621,No,,,,,
,2622,We Were Very Happy With Our Stay At Bovey Castle With The Exception Of The Comments Previously Made Regarding The Castle Bistro Menu & Our Room.,,,,,
,2623,We Were Very Disappointed And Certainly Will Not Be Returning - Not Our Sort Of Place,,,,,
,2627,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay.   Bovey Castle Is In A Wonderful Location And We Enjoyed All The Facilities It Had To Offer.   Our Two Boys Who Are Both Very Sporty Took Advantage Of Every Opportunity.   They Both Play Tennis And Did Mention That They Thought The Tennis Courts Needed Re-Surfacing.   It Is Such A Pity That The Bistro Was A Disappointment And There Are Some Training Issues To Address When It Could Become An Equally Good Part Of The Overall Bovey Castle Experience.    I Hope You Have Found The Comments Constructive.,,,,,
,2632,I Liked The Whole Hotel Very Much Though,,,,,
,2635,Manager Helpful,,,,,
,2636,Very Impressive Grounds,,,,,
,2638,A Superb Venue But Not For Us I Am Afraid,,,,,
,2640,When We Renewed Our Membership It Was The 50Th Year Of Continuously Being A Golf Member Under Richards Control Everything Has Got Better And Better. Thank You.,,,,,
,2642,We Came In Anticipation Of A Pleasant Relaxing Weekend In A Very Special Establishment. What We Got Was A Throughily Bad Experience That Will Remain With Us For A Long Time. The Majority Of These Issues Were Raised With Mr Aristi On The Day We Left And I Am Still Waiting For A Response To My Complaints.,,,,,
,2643,Hope To See You In The Autumn!,,,,,
,2647,When We Pay 5 Star Prices  We Expect A 5 Star Experience. A Week Before  We Had Stayed At The Oxford Spires Hotel (A Four Pillars Hotel). We Had A Better Room  Better Service In The Dining Room  And It Cost Us A Lot Less. Our Stay With You Was Not A 5 Star Experience.,,,,,
,2648,We Thought That The Housekeeping Service Was Exemplary.,,,,,
,2649,Look Forward To A Similar Occasion Next Year,,,,,
,2650,You Should Seriously Look At Pr In The Dining Room.It May Affect Your Business Long Term,,,,,
,2651,See Letter In Post,,,,,
,2652,Overall  An Exceptional Location And An Enjoyable Stay.  Would Be Good To Deal With The Few Negative Things That Detracted From What Could Have Been An Outstanding Experience.,,,,,
,2654,The Booking Confirmation Stated That A Discressioary 5% Service Charge Would Be Added To Our Bill But Did Not Mention The 12.5% Added To The Food Bill,,,,,
,2655,In Need Of Refurbishment,,,,,
,2657,Took Too Long To Order Drinks Once A Member Of Staff Could Be Found.,,,,,
,2658,The Service In The Piano Bar Was Exceptionally Slow And Seemed Rather Muddled.  The Waiter Had To Collect Draft Beer From The Bistro Bar And Sometimes The Order Had Been Foregotten.  It Was Not As Though It Was Really Busy Either.  The Carpet On The Landing Outside Our Suite (No.15) Seemed In A Poor State Of Repair.,,,,,
,2660,We Felt The Newer Added On Addition Detracted From The Overall Atmosphere Of The Castle.  It Did Not Seem To Fit The Rest Of The Building And Aura.    We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Falconer.,,,,,
,2662,We Did Not Have The 'Wow' Experience We Had Expected. The Fact That Mr Aresti Gave Us A Second Chance To Enjoy The Hotel Was Greatly Appreciated  But The Standard We Expected Was Not Really Met.,,,,,
,2663,Just A Big Thank You.,,,,,
,2664,There Were False Charges On My Bill That I Needed To Straighten Out. This Occurred Part Way Through My Stay And At The End.,,,,,
,2667,We Did Make These Comments To Your Staff On Sunday Morning And Had Expected A Response But None Received To Date,,,,,
,2668,Even As We Got This Deal  We Still Found It Very Expensive.  It Was Lovely Whilst We Were There  But This Was A One Off For Us. Not A Problem  But We Should Have Been Told About The Tipping On Top Of Payment.    £14 Each For Cream Tea   Two Scones  That Broke Before You Could Put The Hard Cream On Them  And The Meager About Of Jam.  Thought That Was Excessive,,,,,
,2670,Many Thanks To You All For A Great Stay.,,,,,
,2671,Check Out Tried To Charge For Spa Treatment That We Did Not Have (Almost £100)  But It Was Corrected When I Pointed It Out - A Good Job I Checked It In Detail,,,,,
,2672,Wonderful Swimming Pool Beautifully Maintained,,,,,
,2676,The Falconry Display Was A Definite Bonus. We Have Never Seen Such An Excellent Demonstration Before And We Were Very Glad We Changed Our Plans In Order To Stay On Until After 10.00 A.M. For It.,,,,,
,2682,Our Stay Was All We Had Hoped For And Look Forward To Returning Again  Thankyou,,,,,
,2689,Federico  Polly & The Team Gave Bovey The Extra 'Wow' Factor. Thank You.,,,,,
,2695,Overall We Would Certainly Come Agin  But It Was Not A Discounted Break But A Very Expensive Weekend And We Stay In Lots Of 5* Hotels So Are Familiar With Usual Charges,,,,,
,2711,Really Great Staff,,,,,
,2716,The Falcon Flying Was Disappointing We Only Saw The Birds Fly A Short Distance To A Chair.  The Ferret Racing Was Also Disappointing. The Ferrets Went Through Coloured Tubes And Therefore Could Not Be Seen Until They Appeared In An Open Section In The Middle Where They Lost Their Sense Of Direction. It Would Be Better If There Was Three Clear Tubes So That You Could See Them Racing. Also A Canopy For When Is Is Raining.,,,,,
,2718,We Had A Marvellous Weekend To Celebrate Our Golden Wedding Anniversary And Gave Every Member Of The Family An Experience That They Will Always Cherish,,,,,
,2720,Overall  The Experience Was Lovely  Although Slightly Under Par From Previous Visits.,,,,,
,2724,We Were Incorrectly Charged For An Evening Meal In The Bistro On 25/11/12. But When We Mentioned This To A Member Of Reception It Was Quickly Rectified With Apologies In A Professional Manner,,,,,
,2727,We Won't Be Back And Will Share These Concerns With Exclusive Resorts And Portico,,,,,
,2737,Would Like To Receive Future Offers Available With Regard  To Your Lodges As Well As Hotel Accomodation,,,,,
,2744,The Turn Down Staff Walked In To The Room When My Wife Was Changing   He Knocked Was Told To Wait And Then Came In .,,,,,
,2747,With My Previous Job I Have Stayed In 5Star Hotels All Over The World  Have Worked In The Service Industry For Many Years  And Have Very High Expectations! Bovey Castle Lived Up To All Of These Expectations And Is Certainly In My Top Few. Apart From The Obvious Grandeur Of The Building And The Beautiful Grounds Which Speak For Themselves  I Think That Federico The Hotel Manager Must Take Credit For This  As He Leads A Very Dedicated Professional Team Who Are Doing A Great Job. My Husband And I Had A Wonderful Stay And Thoroughly Enjoyed It. Thank You To All The Team!!!,,,,,
,2753,To Thank The Staff For Their Attentiveness,,,,,
,2754,Did Not Appreciate Service Charge Added To £7 Glass Of Wine In One Of The Lounges!,,,,,
,2758,Did Not Appreciate The Constant Service Charges On The Bill. Felt The Room Rates Were High Compared To Other 'Luxurary' Hotels,,,,,
,2761,Great Hotel. If I Hear Of Anyone Staying There I Shall Recommend That They Enjoy The Stay  But Nip Down To The Local Greasy Spoon Cafe For Breakfast  As The Service Will Be Better.,,,,,
,2773,Bar Bill Was Very Expensive,,,,,
,2779,Difficult To Retrieve Items From Car  After Being Whisked Away To Unknown Area. Albeit Reception Did Tell Me Where It Was.,,,,,
,2783,Love It  Couldn't Fault The Bovey Experience At All- Was Too Busy Being Impressed To Look For Niggles!,,,,,
,2790,Breakfast  Bacon Was Not Cooked And Took 10 Minutes To Sort Out Service A Little Slow At Breakfast And Not Attentive But Overall I Enjoyed The Hotel And Would Return.,,,,,
,2795,Please Dont Take The Negative Points To Seriously  As We All In Enjoyed The Trip!  Had A Wonderful Time And Will Most Definitely Come Back.  Will Probably Just Be A Bit Cautious With Eating In The Restaurants And Probably Plan To Eat More Offsite.,,,,,
,2796,No,,,,,
,2805,We Had A Lovely Stay. Thank You.,,,,,
,2806,Dont See My Comments As Negative They Are A Simple Reflection Of An Experienced 5 Star Traveller  Perhaps The Management Should Invest In Visiting The Best And See How To Impliment Some Additional Things That Would Make Bovey Unique....And It Does Not Have To Cost A Lot,,,,,
,2817,Let Residents Know That The Service Charge Goes To The Staff Who Provide It  And Is Not Just A Surcharge.,,,,,
,2818,No,,,,,
,2827,We Very Much Enjoyed Martin The Falconer Every Morning   And The Ambience Of The Hotel Aswell As The Scenery Was Just Perfect . I Actually Like That Fact That A Service Charge Is Added To Avoid Tipping Issues And To Make Sure The Entire Staff Get The Benefit .,,,,,
,2833,Happy New Year!  And Thank You All For A Wonderful Christmas  X,,,,,
,2841,See Above.,,,,,
,2848,Fantastic Setting  Lovely Hotel And House  Beautiful Grounds  Really Liked The Pool  Good Tennis Facilities. Enjoyed The Falconry Displays. Staff Very Pleasant And Helpful.,,,,,
,2863,Just A Bit Disappointed With The Bedroom,,,,,
,2865,I Never Go Back To This Hotel  Complete Mis Sold,,,,,
,2866,Very Impressed,,,,,
,2871,The Falconry Display Each Morning Was Excellent,,,,,
,2873,We Would Like To Return  But Would Need The Financial Incentive Of A Special Offer!!,,,,,
,2874,4 Members Of Staff Walked Past My Empty Plate  Took 5Th Walk Past To Be Removed,,,,,
,2880,Great Place! We Will Definitely Be Back!,,,,,
,2887,The Experience Is Significantly Different  In The Past Your Rooms Were Fabulously Presented  Staff Were Not Just Courteous  They Were Friendly And This Together With Your Facilities (Especially The Children’S Facilities Made The Place Wonderful). There Has Been An Overall Drop In Standards And This Is A Real Shame.,,,,,
,2901,We Didn't Like The Fact That All Drinks Had To Be Ordered Through Staff,,,,,
,2916,The Hotel Delivers A Truly Five Star Experience From The Moment You Arrive To The Moment You Leave. The Food Is Of Michelin Star Quality And Its Current Star Rating Undervalues The Skills Of The Chef And His Team,,,,,
,2932,Please Stop Sending The Survey Over And Over And Over. I Have Recieved It 11 Times And I Have Never Stayed With You. There Is No Option To Say That They Cannot Be Reached.,,,,,
,3057,Serving Meals Was Atrocious  Lots Of People Working But No One Managing Each Table. So Service Delivery Was Slow.,,,,,
,3077,Thank You For Your Accomodation Toward Our Room Request  It Is Always A Pleasure To Return To Bovey.,,,,,
,3078,Im Sorry But Like I Said Before I Have Found Out That 2 Cards Have Been Stolen. I Reported This On Friday And Luckily Nothing Has Been Stolen From Me (Money Wise),,,,,
,3107,We Have Taken A Lodge At Bovey Castle For The Past Three Years And On All Occasions It Has Been A Very Pleasant Holiday  Hence The Reason We Return  We Shall Be Back Next Year.  Thank You To All The Staff Who Make It Such A Good Holiday  Welcoming Us All Including The Children And Dogs!,,,,,
,3114,I Think This Is The 5Th Time We Have Stayed With You And As Ever A Week At Bovey Is Just Such A Wonderful Experience And We Will Stay Again.,,,,,
,3325,Please Contact Exclusive Resorts As To The Complaints We Have About Our Residence And The Outrageous Shooting Activity Charges.,,,,,
,3707,On First Presentation Of Our Bill We Had Not Recieved The 20% Discount That We Are Entitled To As Members And Had To Request For A Re-Print.  Having Checked The Bill On Return It Appears That We Have Been Charged Full Price For The On-Site Activities We Took Part In - Clay Shooting And Sloe Gin Making.  The Understanding I Have From Our Membership Is That 20% Discount Applies To The On-Site Activities.  I Am Waiting To Hear Back If This Is The Case And Would Appreciate If This Could Be Looked Into.,,,,,
,3708,We Both Paid For Archery Which Was Not A Cheap Activity And We Both Felt That The Guy Giving The Lessons Did Not Have The Same Attitude As The Rest Of The Staff When Talking To Us. This Did Have An Impact In Us Enjoying The Activity Which We Were Very Much Looking Forward To. However He Did Improve Towards The End.,,,,,
,3709,There Is Only One Fred..........Hang On To Him As He Is An Exceptional Chap Who Is Always Central To Our Stay At The Hotel.,,,,,
,3711,The Breakfast Was A Little Confused And Not Brought Out Together  I Ordered Eggs To Accompany The Kippers As The Buffet Eggs Were Hard And Congealed. The Fresh Eggs Arrived 20 Mins After The Kippers. We Chose Not To Dine There Again Despite Breakfast Being Included In The Room Rate,,,,,
,3713,Kids Club Lacked In Staffing (Didn't Remember Child's Name After 3H Session) And Felt As Too Light On Staff Vs Number Of Children. Didnt Stick To The Schedule And Seemed No Activities. Would Not Use Again.  Great Activities In General Around The Castle. Loved The Falconry Display  Atmosphere  Easter Egg Hunt  But Could Have Been Executed Better And Kept Guests Better Informed What Is Going On.,,,,,
,3714,We Didnt Pay The Discretionary Service Charge For The Dinner In The Bistro. The Room Service Team Should Also Be Included In The Discretionary Service Charge  Or At Least There Should Be A Envelope For Them In The Room Book With A Comment.,,,,,
,3715,Lovely  Thank You. Mum Had A Great 60Th Birthday  Which Is All I Could Have Asked For.,,,,,
,3716,I Come Away From Our Stay Thinking What A Shame: This Was Nearly A Great Stay. But It Was Tainted By So Many Mistakes. We Stay Away For Weekends A Lot And Have Lots Of Friends Who Would Have Loved To Find A Dog And Child Friendly Luxury Hotel. But We Could Not Recommend Bovey; As You Might Invest In A Stay And Then Find The Service As We Did. Its Such A Shame  Because If One Could Just Take The Good Bit - Great Food - Some Lovely Staff - Comfortable Large Rooms - Treat Of Falcons After Breakfast - Wonderful Grounds - Then It Would Really Be Up Amoungst The Best We Have Visited: But Sadly With Our Current Experience We Will Be Telling Others To Look Elsewhere.  ,,,,,
,3717,No Further Comments  Everything Has Been Said. Disappointing  Underwhelming And A Shame.,,,,,
,3724,It Was Just Such A Shame As The Location And Facilities Were Just What We Needed  Long Walks  Pool Facilities And Relaxation. This Was Dampened By Poor Service And An Unmaintained Room.  Not What One Would Expect At This Standard Of Hotel.  I Worked In Customer Service For 7 Years And I Would Ask That The Room Is Checked For Details In Terms Of Service - Stains  Chips And General Non Maintenance To Prevent More Disappointments,,,,,
,3729,Still Awaiting Contact From Management Team About The Poor Nights Sleep Due To Staff Noise.,,,,,
,3731,No The Stay Was Wonderful,,,,,
,3732,Lovely Stay Thank You,,,,,
,3743,We Were Really Looking Forward To Staying At Bovey Castle But Sadly Were Very Disappointed. We Have Received Better Service And Quality Of Food At Much More Reasonably Priced Hotels. We Didn't Feel It Deserved Its 5* Status - It Is Overpriced And Very Poor Value. We Don't Mind Paying For Quality But This Is Not What We Received. We Won't Be Returning Nor Recommending It To Friends And Family.,,,,,
,3746,There Was Only One Point To Flag Up From My Stay But I Remembered It.  I Could Not Have A Cup Of Tea In My Room Because Despite The Milk Being In The Fridge And In Date It Was Gone Off.  Upon Request I Was Delivered Fresh Milk But I Thought It Should Be Mentioned.  Everything Else Without Question Exceeded My Expectations.,,,,,
,3749,The Grounds Were Beautiful,,,,,
,3752,Falconry Display On The Sunday Morning Was Excellent  The Chap Was Very Entertaining Was A Real Highlight Of The Visit. I Did On A Couple Of Occasions Walk In On Staff Having Quiet Casual Conversations Around The Reception Area,,,,,
,3753,A Fantastic Stay  Thank You.,,,,,
,3758,As We Only Stayed As Part Of A Wedding We Were Not In A Position To Make Full Use Of All The Facilities Available To Us So We Were Unable To Have The Full 'Bovey Castle Experience'- Perhaps Therefore Not In A Position To Comment Fully!,,,,,
,3764,Having Stayed With You Before And Appreciated The Usual High Standards Of Service  It Was A Little Disappointing To Have Encounterd A Room With No Heating And A Staff Member Not Understanding The Problem  Plus Room Service That Provided Incorrect Dishes And A Staff Member Who Doesn't Understand Whats On The Room Service Menu And Finally Encounter A Black Out In The Room And Find That Maintenance Could Not Locate The Fuse-Box And Remedy The Situation.  ,,,,,
,3766,I Was Very Disappointed To Be Charged For A Daily Newspaper  This Has Never Happened To Me Before At Other Hotels I Have Stayed At  If It Is Offered It Is Included In The Room Rate And There Was No Clear Indication Whn Checking In That This Service Would Be Charged For. Also On The Last Day I Went Over My Agreed Breakfast Allowance. I Was Charged £16.95 For Two Poached Eggs On Two Halves On English Muffin  How This Came In At £2 More Than My Allowance Which Included A Full Cooked Breakfast With Bacon  Sausage  Egg  Black Pudding  Toast Etc Is Beyond Me. These Two Little Things Did Mar What Was Otherwise A Perfect Stay.,,,,,
,3769,We Were Not Expecting A 5% Accomodation Charge And Feel This Is Not Needed! The Final Account Would Have Been Easier To Read Had It Not Been Itemised. The Total Bill From Dinner For Example Would Have Been Easier To Check Rather Than Individual Food / Drink Items.,,,,,
,3770,Reduce Prices Of Drinks  Food And Activities Or Upscale The Quality,,,,,
,3775,The Activities Could Of Been Better Illustrated To Us On Arrival.  We Were Not Aware Of The Clay Pigeon Shooting Until We Walked Past. The Service Charge Added To The Final Bill Is Quite Discourteous When Checking Out.  Yes You Do State This Charge On Your Website But It Leaves The Guests Feeling Truely Ripped Off When Checking Out.  We Had The Charge Removed But Don't Feel We Should Be Subject To The Awkwardness Of Having To Request This In Front Of Other Guests. We Spoke To Other Guests That Assured Us They Would Not Return Because Of This Charge!  Yes An Extra 12% Is Very Nice For You But I Imagine This Charge Is Doing Your Business More Harm Than Good.,,,,,
,3776,One Final Remark To Be Made Is That The Staff Throughout The Hotel Were Generally A Little Scruffy Looking. Of Note Was The Bar Tender In The Oak Room Who  Although Mixing Good Drinks  Presented To Our Table In A Uniform Very Visibly Stained.,,,,,
,3777,My Only Slight Annoyance On Checking Out Was That The 'Discretionary Service Charge' Was Not Presented In A Manor That Seemed Acceptable To Pay Or Not Pay This At My Discretion. It Was Presented In A Way That Made It Awkward To Query  I Would Have Preferred Not To Pay All Of The Service Charge (As I Didn't Think It Was Appropriate On The Room Rate Or Self-Service Breakfast) But Wasn't Comfortable With Raising It  At Reception. Perhaps This Should Be Shown On An Additional Piece Of Paper  Separate To The Other Billed Items  Or Incorporated Into Your Overall Rates To Avoid Embarrassment For Other Guests.,,,,,
,3778,The Valet Parking Was Slightly Disappointing. We Have An Aston And There Were Two Others The Night Of Our Arrival. In The Morning We Went To Get Our Key And It Had Been Left In An Envelope With No Name. They Just Gave It To Us Because 'There Were No Other Aston Keys' It Also Turns Out The Car Had Been Left Unlocked All Night.   That Being Said  The Hotel Is Beautiful  The Staff Were Great And When The Food Was Nice  It Was Very Very Nice But It Was Annoying Having To Pay For Every Little Extra And Having All These Costs Added. Also It's Such A Beautiful Setting That It Seems Silly To Have The Spa Being Less Than Adequate.  Absolutely Lovely Hotel But I Just Couldn't Imagine Paying The Full Room Rate As There Are Too Many Things That Make It Not Of That Standard. All This Aside Though  We Did Have A Nice Time And It Was Very Enjoyable.,,,,,
,3784,Had An Amazing Time!  Not From The Uk But Hoping To Make It Back Someday.,,,,,
,3787,As Above,,,,,
,3792,Although Looking Back I Did Pay The Whole Bill And Saw That There Was Service Charges I Didnt Realise They Were Optional (However Mostly Deserved As All Staff Work Very Hard).  It Was A Little Disappointing To Be Charged A £3 Booking Fee On Top Of The £30 Per Person Fee??,,,,,
,3794,Although A Double Room The Bed Was Made Up Of Two Singles Put Together Which Was Highly Unusual And Not Acceptable.,,,,,
,3806,We Very Much Enjoyed Every Aspect Of Our Stay At Bovey Castle And Will Be Returning In The Future,,,,,
,3811,I Feel That There Are A Few Steps Missing In Terms Of Amount Charged To Stay At Bovey Castle  And Managing Expectations Of Those Who Stay. Yes  The Staff Are Brilliant  And The Grounds Lovely  But The Rooms Themselves Are Basic At Best  And Having To Pay Extra For Things Like Wifi And Breakfast Did Leave Us Feeling Like It Was Not Money Well Spent. Also  Unfortunately I Was Ill In The Morning Of Our Stay  So Did Not Get To Enjoy The Spa At All  Which Was Very Disappointing.,,,,,
,3814,The Falcrony Display Was Brilliant  And The Gentleman Doing It Was Really Entertaining - Thanks!,,,,,
,3817,There Were No Non-Smoking Signs In The Room And So I Smoked Literally 2 Cigarettes. Was Left A Note The Following Day By Cleaning Staff That England Has Non-Smoking Policy And We Would Be Charged A Full Nights Stay To Let The Air Room Out. I Found This Outrageous. Would Have Appreciated A Warning Of Some Sort. I Checked Your Hotel Guide And Did See There That It Was A Non-Smoking Room  But It Also Said A €50 Fee Would Be Imposed  Not A Full Night's Stay  These Policies Should Be In-Line With Each Other. We Had Three More Nights Stay So This Charge Would Have Been Un-Necessary  And Only A Warning Would Have Been Necessary As We Stopped Smoking Immediately. We Decided To Leave A Day Early So That You Would Not Have To Charge Us For Another Night  Which Has Put Us Off Of Your Establishment.,,,,,
,3818,The Free Falcon Display Was Excellent,,,,,
,3822,Our Stay Was As Memorable As Our Wedding There A Year Ago. We Love Visiting And Will Definitely Go Back Again!,,,,,
,3823,It Was Our Second Time Staying With You And As With The Previous Visit We Enjoyed The Decor And Views But It Is Really The Service And Dedication Of Your Staff That Makes Bovey Standout. It Was Wonderful To Have Such A Taste Of Luxury For A Small Period Of Time.,,,,,
,3824,Fabulous Team And A Perfect Setting To Feel Spoiled And Relax,,,,,
,3826,I Love Bovey Castle  The Location And The Design Are Wonderful  And Most Staff Too. Please Don't Let Rubbish Staff Pull It Down.,,,,,
,3827,A Lovely Place However Not Good Value For Money  I Expected More From The Room  Ie Size  Decor And Quality  The Entrance Hall Smelt Very Damp And The Bathroom Was Not Great. (Room 10). I Didn't Notice The Service Charge On The Bill Which I Must Have Paid But Have Yet To Check The Bill.  This Is My Fault For Not Checking It Thoroughly.  I Will Be Visiting The Castle Again For Afternoon Tea But Would Not Stay Overnight.,,,,,
,3833,All Staff Very Very Friendly. I Just Wouldnt Come Back Due To Value For Money Or Recomend It For This Reason.,,,,,
,3839,We Must Of Like Bovey Castle Because We Have Booked The Venue For Our Wedding Next Year,,,,,
,3845,Get A Great Chef In.,,,,,
,3852,I Would Welcome Some Recompense For The State Of The Greens On The Golf Course. My Friends And I Came To Bovey Castle Specifically For The Golf.,,,,,
,3853,We Have Read Article That The Hotel Is Looking To Attract Families & To Be Known As A Family Hotel Of Choice......Such A Great Location & Facilities Should Mean That This Is Easy To Achieve.  We Regularly Take Breaks With Our Childrenand One Thing That Would Achieve This Would To Make The Child Based Activities Cheaper. £32 For Our Son To Fire 5 Clay Pidgeons In A 90Min Lesson Was Excessive  When There Were 10 Children Attending. W Stay At The Bedruthan Steps Hotel In Cornwall Every Year & Where As They Once Charged They Now Offer This Foc....Families Are More Likely To Stay Onsite & Spend Money On Food/Drink.,,,,,
,3854,We Really Liked The Hotel (And The Kids Loved It)  But The Biggest Frustration Was The Absense Of Blackberry And Mobile Signal. While I Appreciate That It Is A National Park And That Some Come Away To Escape Such Distractions  The Truth Is That Modern Working Life Doesn't Really Let You To   Even For A Short Break  And The Absence Of The Ability To Read Emails/Take Calls Generated A Deal Of Anxiety/Frustration. Sort That Out And The Hotel Will Be Fabulous. It Won't Stop Us Coming Again  But It Will Mean That I Have Some Reluctance To Recommend To Others  As Most Of Our Friends  Like Me  Are Unable Just To Drop Out Of Communication Professionally For Any Meaningful Period Of Time  And It Creates Concerns That Undo Some Of The Benefits Of A Stay. I Know Perhaps An Odd Comment  And One Reflective Of The Intrusion Of Electronic Devices On Our Modern Lives  But A Sad Reality All The Same.,,,,,
,3856,Just To Say Thank You To Everyone For Making Our Stay So Very Special!,,,,,
,3858,Have Spoken To Manager About My Concerns,,,,,
,3862,Unacceptable Situation With Regard To Taxis Arranged For Our Departure Held In Confusion For Someone Else That Caused Us To Miss Our Train To London And Loose Several Hours Of Our Tour Of London The Only Day We Were There.,,,,,
,3866,I Do Not Like All The Additional Service Charges Being Added To The Bill.  Although You Say It Is Discretionary The Bill Format Does Not Really Imply That,,,,,
,3867,There Is A Real Issue With Consistent Levels Of Good Service At This Hotel. Some Members Of The Team Are Fabulous And Others Are Awful - Which Clouds The Overall Experience Of Staying At This Lovely Hotel  And Makes The Discretionary Service Charge  Added To Everything - Seem A Bit Of An Insult. Removing This Might Be The Easiest Way To Identify The Members Of Staff Giving Poor Service. The Hotel Desperately Needs A Full Time Bartender With An Extensive Knowledge.,,,,,
,3868,This Was Our 5Th Visit And We Will Be Back Next Year  Thank You!,,,,,
,3869,Ongoing Query On Our Bill And We Have Been Extremely Disappointed With The Service In This Matter As We Have Been Continuously Ignored When We Phone Or Email About It. Without This We Would Have Definitely Rated The Experience And Chances Of Returning As Top Score,,,,,
,3870,An Extremely Pleasant Stay With Very Professional Staff Always Willing To Help And Assist With Your Needs,,,,,
,3871,Great To Have The Use Of The Sledges To Take Advantage Of The Snow  If We Hadn't Have Bumped Into The Cocktail Guy We Would Not Have Known You Had Them.,,,,,
,3873,We Got Up Early For The Falconry Display Which Unfortunately Was Not On That Day  It Would Have Been Good If We Were Informed The Day Before So We Could Have Planned The Morning To Exclude That. Obviously If Advance Warning Could Not Have Been Given That Is Understandable. I Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay  Next Time I Will Bring My Husband.,,,,,
,3874,Shame Not More Of A True British Experience Seems All Too Overdone! Could Be So Much Better Presented If Kept More Simple- Like The Beautiful Gardens And The Swim Pool The Spa Was Lovely But Not Unlike Others I Have Used. I Did Feel Some Of The Areas Could Do With A Lick Of Paint!,,,,,
,3876,Service Charge Automatically Added To Bills Became Excessive And Would Have Preferrred To Have Left A Tipo At The End Of The Stay.,,,,,
,3877,Bovey Is A Beautiful Place And I Would Usually Recommend It But At The Moment I Do Not Feel It Lives Up To The Cost  All Due To Most Staff Not Being Very Well Trained.,,,,,
,3878,Overall Experience Was Good But Over-Priced And Several Areas Fell Well Below Expectations  So Didnt Feel Like Value For Money.  If You Charge As Much As You Do Then Guests Expect Everthing To Be Perfect Especially Food And Waiting Service Levels.,,,,,
,3880,My Experience Was So Poor That I Would Never Consider Returning. I Am Obviously Spreading The Word About How Terrible Bovey Castle Is.,,,,,
,3881,Thank You  We Had A Very Restful Time.,,,,,
,3883,Well Done!,,,,,
,3886,Most Hotels Of Similar Standing To Bovey Would Provide Free Wi-Fi For Their Guests. I Was Surprised This Was Not The Case.,,,,,
,3889,The Final Bill Is Over Engineered ! I Understand That You Are Trying To Show A Service Charge For Every Item But This Makes The Bill Run To 3 Or 4 Pages And It Is Too Much To Check Through For A 3 Night Stay. Why Do You Not Just Increase The Price Of The Items To Cover The Service Charge And Make It Simple?,,,,,
,3895,I Have No Problems If Anyone Wants To Contact Me To Talk Through My Experience.  The Setting And Building Were Very Nice  But There Were Some Reaosonable Issues That Didn't Make The Bovey Castle Experience As Positive As It Should Be For What Is Clearly A Hotel Looking To Be Very Prestigous.,,,,,
,3899,Afternoon Tea Fabulous!,,,,,
,3900,Really Loved All The Additional Activities.  Also Seemed Great For Children So We Will Bring Them Next Time.,,,,,
,3903,On Arrival  We Were Informed That We Had Been Upgraded To A Superior Room. This Was Confusing  However  As We Had Booked A Superior Room! Overall  Our Stay At Bovey Castle Was Pleasant And Relaxing  Despite The Few Disappointments.,,,,,
,3906,The Rug In The Adams Room Is Dangerous And I Watched Several People (Young And Old) Trip Between The Sofa And The Chairs That Are By The Fireplace.,,,,,
,3907,The Gestures Of Breakfast And Afternoon Tea On The Hotel  We're Much Appreciated. Federico Is An Asset To The Hotel And Without His Intervention  Our Visit Would Have Been A Disaster,,,,,
,3909,Play Barn Was A Great Activity. Cocktails In The Bar Made To Perfection. Always Plenty Of Concierge/Reception Staff On Hand.,,,,,
,3910,I Will Write Separately,,,,,
,3911,I Ordered Extra Sandwiches With Afternoon Tea  Four Additional Fingers Arrived  Which Were Additionally Charged At £6. The Waitress Had No Idea Of The Pastries  But Was Friendly.  On Our Departure  The Staff On Duty Brought Us To Our Car And Bid Us Farewell Whilst Battling With Folding Up A Tourist Brochure.  The Sommelier In The Edwardian Grill Was Friendly And Competent  But We Felt A Little Too Familiar.,,,,,
,3913,We Really Enjoyed The Golf. Although We Didn't Take Up Any Of The Activities  We Were Impressed With How Much Was On Offer.,,,,,
,3914,Our Stay Was Wonderful Except For The Restaurant Service Which Unfortunately Would Make Me Hesitant To Come Back.,,,,,
,3915,The Manager Was Very Nice And Very Good - Thank You For A Nice Holiday!,,,,,
,3916,Fabulous Experience,,,,,
,3917,Bistro Allowance Included In Room Rate Should Include Drinks! We Spend Approx £50 In The Bistro Including Drinks But Were Charged Separately For The 2 Diet Cokes We Had. Really?  Overall We Were Really Disappointed As We Were So Excited About Visiting Bovey!  Also - Another Friend Who Stayed In The Lodge Also Asked About Getting A Reduced Rate For A Friday Night Stay As They Were Arriving Late. And Were Told That A Reduced Rate Was Not Possible. So They Cancelled The Booking Directly With Bovey And Booked Via Helpful Holidays Website. Got 2 Nights For The Price Of One! Sort It Out!,,,,,
,3920,Only Regarding The Breakfast. Spending £5000 For Two Nights I Would Expect This To Be Included. This Detracted From The Overall Experience  Albeit It Wasn't A Large Cost,,,,,
,3921,Discretionary Charges !!!!! There Was Nothing So Exceptional About The Hotel That Warranted The Discretionary Charge  For The Amount Of Money I Paid I Was Disgusted By This Addition- I Would Rather Have Booked A Spa Break At 409.50 Each Than 390.00 Plus Discretionary !! Its On The Bill Thats Not Discretionary Its Awkward And Its For This Reason That I Would Not Return Or Recommend If 5% Is At My Discretion Then It Shoukld Be My Choice. ,,,,,
,3923,If You Are Going To Place Guests On The Side Of The Castle Above The Entrance Because Of The Noise You Should Be Charging Half The Price. Do Not Suggest In Your Literature That Bovey Castle Is A Place For Rest And Relaxation When Guests Are Bothered By That Level Of Noise In The Middle Of The Night And Have Paid A Fortune For The Pleasure.,,,,,
,3924,Although You Are Dog Friendly  You Lack Dog Knowledge.  Your Staff Left Chocolates/Sweets On Our Bed Whilst We Were At Dinner Whilst Our Dogs Were Alone In The Bedroom.  One Of Our Greedy Dogs Ate The Chocolates/Sweets.  Chocolate Is Poisonous For Dogs!  The Greedy Dog Then Vomited.,,,,,
,3926,It Was Unfortunate That The Shower In My Room Didn't Work  However It Was Eventually Resolved By Moving Rooms; However This Was A Struggle. The Receptionist  In My Opinion Should Not Have Asked Me 'If I Was Able To Cope'  She Should Have Immediately Offered Another Room.  This Is Not The Service That You Would Expect From A High Quality Establishment.,,,,,
,3927,Our Stay At Bovey Was A Wonderful Week Away  We Managed Very Quickly To Totally Relax Into The Beautiful Surrounds Suppported By The Very Helpful And Able Staff.,,,,,
,3930,I Am Waiting To Hear Back With Regards To The Medicine Bottles That We Left In The Fridge.  One You Have And So Should Hopefully Receive In The Post However The Small Bottle Was Thrown Away By The Cleaning Lady!  I Hope To Hear From The Manager As To How This Will Be Resolved As It Was My Husband's Medication For His Chest Infection Which He Is Now Without!,,,,,
,3931,For This Question (No. 27 - How Did Your Experience With Us Meet With Your Expectations?) I Just Put Met. That's Because I Knew From The Start That I Would Have An Enjoyable And Relaxing Visit Not Because It Fell Short Of Anything.,,,,,
,3932,The Use Of The Golf Buggy Was Fantastic And Easy To Use. The Service At Breakfast On The Monday Morning Was Great And Huge Improvement To The Previous Morning. It Felt All Weekend We Were Either Not Wanted Or Forgotten By The Staff. From The Bikes  The Breakfast  The Booking Problems  The Fireplace Issue And The Mistakes In The Bill It Just Seemed Like A Constant Battle. Having Said That  The Spa Treatments  Cider Making Session And Archery Sessions Were All Conducted Professionally And With Friendly Approach And Hence Thoroughly Enjoyed. Should There Be Another Wedding  The Front Reception Should Still Have Been Accessible By Other Guests And Alternative Arrangements For Breakfast Be More Thoroughly Thought Through. If Not You Should Not Allow Other Guests At The Hotel If You Can Not Cope.,,,,,
,3933,By Far The Staff  The Grounds And The Food Were The Factors That Will Stand Out In My Mind For Years To Come.,,,,,
,3934,Falconry Display Was Excellent. The Next Day The Manager Was Very Pleasant And He Did Take Some Money Off Our Bill  But His Reaction At The Time Was Very Unprofessional. I Work In Events And Know How Important It Is To Deal With Problems In The Moment And When Clients Are Paying A Lot Of Money This Is What They Expect.,,,,,
,3937,Improve Mobile Phone Reception,,,,,
,3938,Sort Out The Kitchen/Dining/Service And Redecorate The Rooms If You Expect Me To Pay What I Paid.,,,,,
,3940,Please Improve The Restaurant And We Will Be Back!!!,,,,,
,3951,Awesome!! Cant Wait To See You Again. (Follow Me On Twitter @Palmrick),,,,,
,3952,Thank You Again Federico - Your Team And You Make Bovey Castle Such A Special Place - Looking Forward To Returning!,,,,,
,3953,All In Previous Comment Box,,,,,
,3955,Saturday Morning I Always Watch The Morning Line But Our Tv Was Not Working On That Chanel So I Missed It Sadly  I Made Reception Aware As I Wanted To Return Later In The Day To Watch The Racing In The Afternoon  And The Tv Had Been Mended  Which Was Fab,,,,,
,3956,On Sat Morning I Always Like To Watch A Programme On Chanel 4  Our Chanel 4 Was Not Working So I Sadly Missed It  I Notified Reception And The Problem Was Rectified By The Afternoon,,,,,
,3958,We Booked A Break Over Easter On A Special 3 For 2 Deal And I Called Up To Make The Reservation. We Wanted A Family Room With A Separate Room For The 2 Chiildren (Aged 1 And 3) And Gave Their Names And Ages With The Booking But Arrived To Find Ourselves In A Single Smallish Room (Room 25) With A Cot And Sofa In The Room. (Clearly It Looked As Though We Had Been Bumped Into Another Room And Was The 3 Year Old Expected To Sleep On The Sofa?) I Asked For A Bigger Room And Was Given A Choice Of Moving To Room 60 Which We Accepted (At Least It Was A Big Bigger) When Leaving A Charge Of An Extra £200 Per Night Was Added To The Bill Which I Was Not Happy About. I Agreed To Pay £400 (2 Of The 3 Nights As We Had Already Booked Under A 3 For 2 Deal) I Would Have Been Happier Getting A Separate Room For The Children (Which Is All We Wanted) And Disappointed To Pay The Extra Money. We Always Enjoy Staying At Bovey Castle But This Experience Was Not The Best.,,,,,
,3962,None,,,,,
,3963,We Had A Fabulous Stay And Left Feeling Relaxed And Recharged. An Exceptional Hotel With Staff To Match. Thank You.,,,,,
,3964,To Have A 5 Star Hotel And The Room Then Have Stains And Broken Windows Is Not What We Call 5 Star  It Should All Be Perfect.  The Fine Dining Also Needs To Be Looked At And Staff Trained And More Added When Busy So Diners Feel Like Its A 5 Star Hotel And Not Used Another Hotel Dining Experience.,,,,,
,3965,Grounds And Surrounding Countryside Were Beautiful.  Walks Detailed In Your Book Were Lovely.  Really Enjoyed This Activity In The Wonderful Weather.,,,,,
,3968,Reduce Your Prices For Repeat Guests And Ensure Children Are Out Of The Pool During Adult Times,,,,,
,3970,I Think The Hotel Is Lovely. It Has A Really Friendly  Warm Atmosphere. I Loved All The Christmas Trees Everywhere; It Made It Seem A Bit Magical. My 3 Boys Loved It. The Activities Were Super.,,,,,
,3971,Thanks For The Splendid Stay!,,,,,
,3972,As Mentioned  I Believe If You Automatically Add A Service Charge To All Services  No Matter How Discretionary It Is  Then The Service Should Be Of A High Enough Standard To Warrant This. If Not It Leaves The Guest In The Uncomfortable Position Of Having To Ask For It To Be Removed Rather Than Being Free To Tip As They Feel Is Appropriate.,,,,,
,3974,The Staff Mentioned Were Very Helpful And Thoughtful.,,,,,
,3975,Just A Wonderful Experience  Would Recommend To Friends And We Will Certainly Visit Again!,,,,,
,3976,As You Will See From This Survey  We Have Many Causes For Compliant This Time Round. We Were In The Middle Of Drafting A Letter Of Compliant To Federico When We Saw This Survey To Complete.  We Therefore Look Forward To Your Response. ,,,,,
,3978,Bar Staff Could Have Been More Attentive  On One Occassion We Waited For Service In The Bar For So Long We Left.,,,,,
,3981,Whilst I Had A Few Issues During My Stay With The Quality Of The Food And Technical Problems  The Staff Were Always Willing To Try And Help.,,,,,
,3983,The Refreshments And Toiletries In The Room Were Lovely  Especially The Home-Made Biscuits And Fudge  However We Will Not Be Recommending This Hotel To Friends Unless They Can Find A Good Deal On-Line.  My Wife Emailed The Hotel A Couple Of Days After Our Stay (05/3/13) With Our Comments And We Were Hoping For A Response But Haven't Heard Back From Anyone.  Very Disappointing.,,,,,
,3986,Lovely Ambiance  Great Room  Great Breakfast But Some Things Over Expensive. E.G. To Advertise Horse Riding At About £70 An Hour Is Ridiculous  As We Paid A Riding Stable Direct At Half That Price  And Paying £7.60 For 2 Coffees In The Lounge (Which Wasn't Even That Great - Lukewarm And Over Stewed) Was Plainly Wrong.,,,,,
,3989,An Altogether Lovely Experience.,,,,,
,3990,Breakfast Service Was Very Good.  Friendly  Informed Staff.  Experience Met My Expectations And We Had A Relaxing Stay.  Might Not Rush Back As The Prices Are Overall On The High Side For Somewhat Outdated Accommodation.  Might Try Hotel Endsleigh Next Time.,,,,,
,3994,None  Just Keep Up The Good Work.,,,,,
,3997,Make The Wifi Free. Also The Right Hand Computer In The Business Suite Wasn't Working Properly.  But We Loved Our Stay And Florence Our Dog Enjoyed As Well!,,,,,
,3998,Sadly I Had Very High Expectations  The Beauty Of Your Venue And Its Surroundings And The Quality Of Your Rooms Build An Expectation That In Service  Food And General Attention To Detail You Sadly Are Not Meeting.,,,,,
,4000,An Information Sheet Left On Our Bed At Turn Down Said That We Should Vacate Our Room By 10Am But Our Booking Said By 11Am.  There Was Also Some Useful Activity Information Included But It Would Be Better To Receive This On Check-In So That You Could Decide Whether To Partake The Next Day And Book In Time. The Choice Of Magazines In The Lounges Were Golf  Fishing  Bridal  Spa And Newspapers.  It Would Be Nice To Have Some Glossy Women's Magazines To Read. The Falconry Display In The Morning Was Very Enjoyable. It Would Be Good If There Was One Lounge With A Child Friendly Corner With For Example A Dolls House  Train Set And Books So That You Can Enjoy A Glass Of Wine And / Or Afternoon Tea While Still Entertaining A Young Child / Toddler If You Wish.  Family Time In The Hotel After The Barn Activities Have Finished Means There Is Little Else To Occupy Them Once It Is Dark And Before / After Dinner.,,,,,
,4003,I Bet All Staff Have Real Job Satisfaction. Either All The Staff Are Really Good Actors Or Everyone Loves Working At Bovey Castle. The Smell Of The Open Fire In The Cathedral Room Welcomes You When You Walk In The Hotel And You Can Still Smell It On The 2Nd Floor - Absolutely Lovely Place And Can't Wait To Be Back There Again In June With The Rest Of My Company!,,,,,
,4005,Your Bills Are Hard To Check. You Have Dinner Say And Sign For It. Say 200Gbp. When The Bill Goes On Your Account. It Doesn't Say Dinner 200Gbp It Says Drinks 80 Gbp Service 40 Gbp And Food 80 Gbp. When You Have Lots Of Items On Your Account It Is Hard To Reconcile Them To What You Have Actually Paid For. However I Still Spotted The 200 Gbp Of Over Charges But There Could Of Been More.  It Does Feel A Bit Dishonest Of The Hotel To Have Made So Many Mistakes On My Bill And Took The Shine Of An Otherwise Great Stay.,,,,,
,4017,Thank You And We Look Forward To Visiting Again,,,,,
,4018,Lovely Stay  Treated Our Daughter (3Yrs) Like A Princess!!,,,,,
,4019,A Wonderful Break In Such A Beautiful Location Made Even Better By The Staff. It Was Very Special.,,,,,
,4020,We Are Looking To Bring Our Family Of 9 Or 10 For Xmas Next Year As You Were Fully Booked This Year But We Will Look At Alternatives Forst And We Would Want This Special Treat To Be Very Special,,,,,
,4021,We Always Love Coming To Bovey Castle  We Have Visited Each Year For The Last 3 Years And Have 2 Visits Planned For Next Year.,,,,,
,4024,Loved The Hotel And Hope To Be Able To Visit Again,,,,,
,4027,Big Dissapointment After Looking Forward To It For So Long,,,,,
,4032,Please Could You Spend Some Money On Improving The Outdoor Play Equipment - The Swings Have Been Broken Since We Stayed Last October.  Attractive Wooden Climbing Play Equipment Would Still Be In Keeping With The Style Of Bovey Castle And Would Be A Great Way Of Entertaining The Children Outside.,,,,,
,4033,A Fire Alarm Went Off On The Sunday Evening  There Were 3 Members Of Staff Running Up And Down The Corridor Whilst They Attended To An Over Heated Iron  It Was Very Unclear Whether People Should Evacuate Or Not  Would Have Been More Helpful If These Members Of Staff Told The Guests Including Me In That Corridor That All Was Ok And Not To Evacuate  It Was All Very Confusing And I Ended Up Having To Explain To People Not To Panic.,,,,,
,4037,In General There Was A Feeling Of Scimping On The Food Both In Quantity And When It Was Served. At The Other Extreme The Staff Were Perhaps A Little Too Eager To Attend To Our Bags And Cars Etc. It Was Rather Unnerving To Be Relieved Of My Keys  Car And Bags As Soon As I Turned Up. Sorry  You Did Ask!,,,,,
,4039,We Had Two Lodges  One With Baby Equipment (Cot  Stair Gates Etc).  When Checking In We Were Given The Keys To The Lodge Without The Baby Equipment In Error  And In The Discussion As To Whether We Should Swap Lodges  We Were Told That The Lodges Were Exactly The Same  So We Decided To Have The Baby Equipment Moved Instead.  When The Rest Of The Party Arrived We Found The Other Lodge Was Very Different To Ours  And Much Better Suited To Children  So We Ended Up Having To Swap Lodges And Having The Equipment Moved Again.  A Lot Of Unnecessary Hassle Could Have Been Avoided If We'd Received An Accurate Answer To The Question 'Are The Lodges The Same'!,,,,,
,4044,We Had A Fabulous Time  Thank You Again  We Will Return!,,,,,
,4045,The Level Of Service Was Even Better Than The Best Hotels I've Stayed At In London (Carnation Hotels).  Where Others Promise Service At This Level Your Staff Carried Through.,,,,,
,4046,Customer Service Leaves Much Room For Improvement  Very Disappointing.  We Were Looking At It As A Potential Wedding Venue As Well,,,,,
,4049,A Great Stay Once Again - Next Time I Would Like To See If We Can Ge A Room That Can Be Split Even If It Is One That Faces Front And Back In The Roof As The Suite Was Fine But It Seemed To Spoil The Room And I Cant See That It Would Be Be Any More Than The Suite's Cost.,,,,,
,4051,Overall A Very Pleasent Stay. Lovely Touches Such As Christmas Tree In The Room Etc. Great Bar Staff. Very Disappointing About The Televisions In The Grand Suite Room However.,,,,,
,4052,Overall A Disappointing Experience For The Price Of The Accommodation And Food.  You Have All The Right Ingredients At Bovey For An Outstanding Stay  But The Attention To Detail Is Lacking.,,,,,
,4054,A Great Experience And Pet Friendly Which Is Perfect Situation For Short Breaks,,,,,
,4062,We Were Celebrating Our 10Th Wedding Anniversary And It Was Important To Us That We Had A Perfect Couple Of Days As We Rarely Get The Chance To Go Away On Our Own.  I Have To Say It Really Was Just What We Wanted; All Of The Staff Were Lovely  The Food Was Superb  The Setting Was Gorgeous And We Really Felt Like We Were Being Looked After Without Any Of The Stuffiness That Sometimes Goes Alongside '5 Star'.  Well Done And Thank You.,,,,,
,4067,U Buy The Breakfast And Dinner Package.....U Need To Make Those Experiences Better Because Spend So Much Time Eating........Disappointed In The Look And Food Of Restaurants....Otherwise Experience Is Wonderful....Love Bovey....So Beautiful,,,,,
,4068,Brilliant Experience For My Family And Would Recommend To My Friends. Next Time Hopefully Ill Get A Round Of Olf In!,,,,,
,4069,We Had A Lovely Family Holiday - Please Send Me Details Of Future Offers Etc!!!,,,,,
,4072,Final Account Was Too Detailed,,,,,
,4076,You Should Not Charge For Internet Use (Conde Nest Has Started A Shame List Of Hotel Who Charge For Internet). The Cost Of The Bedrooms Is To High For What They Are. The Rooms Are Outdated And The Stains On Wall  Sheets Are Not Reflective Of A 5* Hotel. 12.5% Service Charge Should Not Be Added To Your Bill Considering The Staff Is Inexperienced And Not Trained To 5* Level,,,,,
,4077,The Lego Room Service Is A Superb Idea!,,,,,
,4078,I Am Sure Some People Enjoy The Peace(!)  But If A Mobile Phone Signal Booster Could Be Installed It Would Be Hugely Beneficial To Those Of Us Who Have Their Own Businesses And Need To Be Contactable.,,,,,
,4079,As With Our Trip In 2012  A Thoroughly Enjoyable Time Was Had. We Shall Certainly Be Back,,,,,
,4080,I Read In The Information How You Distrubute The Service Charges And Would Like To Comend You On The Way This Is Done. Many Customer Service Based Companies Will Forget About The Back Of House Staff When It Comes To Tips And They Loose Out  Even Though They Are Just As Important (If Not More So) Than The Front Of House Staff.,,,,,
,4081,Reception Staff Were Great And We Did Voice Our Complaint At That Time.,,,,,
,4085,I Dont Want To Sound Like I Hated The Experience  But We Did Not Leave Feeling Great Which Is What We Had Done After The First Hotel. We Also Did Not Get To Stay And Use The Facilities At Either Hotel As Much As We Would Have Wanted As Our Dog Had A Stroke On The Monday And We Did Not Feel We Could Leave Her For Too Long. But We Managed A Game Of Tennis Which Was Great And We Loved The Grass Court And We Had A Swim And Sauna Which Was Nice And Again The Meal Was Lovely   So We Did Have A Nice Time And The Hotel Is Beautiful With Some Lovely Art Etc. We Saw The Falconry Display In The Morning Which Was Also Very Good Fun. Just Left With A Bitter Taste In Our Mouths (Oh Yes And The Guy Who Took Our Luggage Down Didnt Put Our Tennis Racquets In Our Car As He Though They Were The Hotels And It Is A Good Job We Checked Otherwise We Would Have Had To Come Back For Them!!! ),,,,,
,4086,Children's Activities Were Far Too Expensive  For An Hour And A Half.   I Did Like The Fact Tha The Manager Was Very Visible Throughout Our Stay,,,,,
,4088,The Final Account Was Diffucult To Understand  As There Is No Detail With The Single Amounts  What It Actually Was  But Only Where It Was From (Bar  Restaurant  Room Service  Etc.). It Was Already Difficult For Us To Follow The Final Account After A 2 Day Stay. Had We Stayed For E.G. A Week  It Would Have Been Simply Impossible To Understand The Details In The Final Account.,,,,,
,4090,The Outside Of The Hotel Beautiful   Need To Spend More Money Yearly In Bedrooms,,,,,
,4091,My Children Did Archery And Egg Hunting   They Had A Great Time,,,,,
,4093,Lovely Place.  My Only Complaint Has Nothing To Do With The Hotel; No Cell Service!  (Maybe That's Also A Good Thing  But I Had Some Work Items That Needed Help With).  We Did Have Trouble With The Wifi And Couldn't Make That Go  But I Didn't Worry About It Too Much.  Otherwise Very Nice  If We're In The Area Again  We'll Come Back.  Although It's A Bit Of A Trip From Canada!!,,,,,
,4094,I Very Much Enjoyed My Stay  But The Poor Service Makes Me Worry That Corners Are Being Cut And That The Hotel May Be Going Downhill.,,,,,
,4095,I Think If You Have Older Children Or A Couple Then It May Be A Different Experience. If You Like Us Have Pre School Then There Is Room For Improvement. The Travel Cot Had A Large Hole And Was Old And The High Chair Had Seen Better Days. For A Five Star I Would Have Expected A Higher Quality Product. There Needs To Be More Contact From The Staff If You Are Staying In The Lodges As Apart From Housekeeping You Have Very Little To Do With The Hotel  A Site Map Would Be Handy To Have In The Lodge. The Bistro Really Needs Improving  We Decided To Reserve A Table Even Though Reception Thought It Not Necessary. It Seemed Again A Little Bit Awkward On Arrival. Having Said All That The Lodges Are Very Relaxing And Have Great Feel About Them  But It's The Little Things That Are Important.,,,,,
,4097,We Opted For Breakfast In Our Room. It Was £14.95 Per Person And I Was Very Disappointed. The Fruit Salad Was Very Basic. The Quality Of The Food Was Not Worthy Of Such An Expensive Price. We Then Had To Request Cups For Our Tea And Coffee.,,,,,
,4099,We Wish You And Your Team All The Best!,,,,,
,4101,It's Time To Give The Caged Birds A New Home.  It's Not What I Would Expect To See At A Hotel In This Day And Age.,,,,,
,4102,Put As Much Effort Into The Hotel As The Cheese Board And The Spa - Don't Rely On The Location And The Decor In The Main Rooms.,,,,,
,4104,Room Service Menu Was More Limited Than Previously. Lodges Are Lovely But In Places Are Looking A Bit Tatty - A Coupl Fo The Chest Of Drawers Were Broken  And Telly In The Lounge Was Too Tiny!,,,,,
,4107,An Excellent Stay And We Hope To Be Back!,,,,,
,4108,You Have To Do A Lot To Make A Real 5 Star House Of Bovey Castle  Not Even The Mobile Phone Works There.,,,,,
,4109,Whilst I Was Reimbursed For Our Stay Due To The Issues Outlined  Money Was Never An Issue. It Was Our Honeymoon  That Time Is Now Lost! At No Point When Booking This Visit Was I Offered To Upgrade The Room  Or Offered The Bridal Suite. I Wasn't Even Made Aware That Bovey Castle Had One Until I Was Leaving! I Could Not Have Reiterated Enough To Cathrine When Booking This Visit That It Was For Our Honeymoon. My Wife And I Feel Very Let Down As You Only Get One Honeymoon.,,,,,
,4110,The Extra Charges We Thought It Was A Bit Petty  When You Pay £400 For The Room.We Were  Charged For Newspapers. I Strugled To Get A Phone Line Out Of The Room To Ring Home And When I Eventaully Got Through I Was Charged £5.00 For 2 Short Calls  As There Was No Mobile Phone Coverage.,,,,,
,4112,I Think The Service Charge Should Not Be Automatically Added To Every Bill Which You Pay For Automatically. Staff Should Ask After Every Meal/Activity If You Wish To Pay Not Just Add It On Without Asking.,,,,,
,4114,Although The Castle Is Very Formal In Appearance  The Staff Make You Feel That You Are At Home.  ,,,,,
,4117,The Food At Breakfast Was Excellent. However This Was Let Down By The Delay In Clearing Plates. 4 Staff Walked Past My Plate Without Removing It,,,,,
,4118,Generally I Felt The Customer Service Was Poor. The Hotel Seemed To Rely On The Grandness Of Its Setting Rather Than The Quality Of Its Service. For Example  When I Discussed A Problem With Using The Pool With Reception They Quibbled Rather Than Immediately Helping. It Was This Kind Of Thing That Really Undermined Our Stay.,,,,,
,4119,The Very Best Thing Is The Excellent Hill Running Which Can Be Done From The Hotel- Not A Minstream Interest But Very Good.,,,,,
,4121,Had A Really Nice Stay Despite The Few Little Issues Stated.,,,,,
,4124,When Paying So Much For Accomodation  Having Discretionary Service Charges Added And Having To Be Pro-Active To Opt Out Of Them (If Desired) Left Us With A Sense Of Lose-Lose. This Was The Feeling We Drove Away With.  Our Package Included Dinner And Breakfast In The E/Grill. Our Dinners Plus Service Charge Came To Less Than Our Allowance  Yet On The Final Bill  The Discretionary Charge Was Still Added On Top. This Stuck Us As Greedy (By The Owners).,,,,,
,4126,Price Is Five Star Level  But Quality Is Absolutely Bellow. It's A Pitty  Because It's Such A Beautiful Surrounding. You Don't Get What You Expect! It's Unusual To Add Another 5% In The Bill. We Have Been In Our Trip To Other Relais&Chateau And Slh  And It Was Better And Cheaper! (Gravety Manor  Castle Combe Manor House).,,,,,
,4129,No,,,,,
,4133,Overall This Was A Lovely 5* Experience  Apart From The Accommodation Which I Believe For The Money Charged Is Unacceptable And More Of A 2* Room. The Castle Itself  The Grounds And All Public Rooms Were Wonderful  But We Were Extremely Disappointed With The Quality Of The Bedrooms. If These Were Renovated Then It Would Be A Perfect Stay And I Would Be Back In A Heartbeat.,,,,,
,4136,If Bovey Castle Were My Hotel  I Would Hope That Guests Would Mention In This Survey The Disappointment That Was Breakfast. Juice (Was This Fresh?)  Toast (Thin Sliced Bread)  Bacon (Dry  Overcooked)  Poached Eggs (Poor  Overcooked/ Reheated?) And Coffee (A Tough Call To Get Right  But Hey).,,,,,
,4138,Had The In-Lodge Dining If Curry For Four  And Whilst Extremely Generous  There Was Far Too Much Food. It Could Probably Have Fed Eight! As I Say Generous  But Perhaps A Bit Of A Waste!,,,,,
,4140,Hopefully I Will Be Back!,,,,,
,4142,The Staff Always Go Out Of There Way To Ensure That We Have What Feels Like An Exclusive Weekend.,,,,,
,4143,We Have Stayed 3 Times In The Last 6 Months At Bovey Castle And Had Previously Enjoyed Both Stays With The Exception Of The Departure Process On The Second Stay Where We Were Incorrectly Charged Too Much And When Queried Were Made To Wait And When When We Chased For A Response Were Asked To Wait Another 15 Minutes Until Somone Was Free To Deal With The Issue - The Only Way We Were Able To Depart Was To Pay The Higher Charge And Then Await A Phone Call To Refund The Overchrage Later In The Day - Completely Unacceptable. This Latest Stay Was A Significant Dissapointment As For Us Bovey Castle Has A Perfect Location  Great Ambience And Friendly Staff However The Quality Of Service  The Food And The Room Outweighed These On This Occasion And Left Us Very Dissapointed With The Whole Experience.,,,,,
,4146,I  And I Expect A Lot Of Other People (I Think I Had Read A Similar Comment On Tripadvisor)  Really Resent Paying For Wifi. For The Sake Of £1/ Hr Or £20/ Week I Really Think You Should Include This For Free (Or If Worried About The Loss Of A Few Pounds  Add The Cost Onto The Room Rate). Free Wifi I Think Is Appreciated By Guests (Everybody Likes To Think They Are Getting Something For Nothing) And Conversely Having To Pay For It Leaves A Bad Taste In The Mouth!,,,,,
,4147,I Think That Training Is Needed With A Certain Waiter. I Can Not Believe That A Waiter Does Not Even Know What Is Vegetarian On A Small Menu. What If A Guest Was Allergic To Something And Was Told It Was Not In The Food. There Is More To Being A Good Waiter Than Being Polite And Helpful. They Should Also Know The Menu.,,,,,
,4149,I Missed The Fudge On The Pillow Which Was A Nice Touch Previously. The Wellie Boot Stock Was Very Low But I Gather They Are On Order.,,,,,
,4150,All Other Aspect Of The Service Was Excellent!,,,,,
,4151,You Have Some Great Staff And Some Who Probably Require Further Training. As A Result The Service Is Patchy Depending On Who It Is. It Would Be Good To Have A More Uniform Standard Of Service Throughout The Hotel.,,,,,
,4153,I Like How The Lodge Feel Was Maintained. I Enjoyed How The Private Spaces Were Maintained In The Main Lodge Near The Fireplace. Very Unique,,,,,
,4155,Absolutely Stunning Location - Would Love To Stay In The Future For A Length Of Time With The Family.,,,,,
,4159,Thank You All And It Was Such A Pleasure To See Some Old Faces,,,,,
,4160,The Pool And Sauna Were Wonderful,,,,,
,4172,I Think You Should Reconsider Your 'Discretionary' Service Fees That Are Automatically Included For The Following Reasons: 1) It Does Not Make Them Discretionary  But Rather One Feels Forced.  2) The Service In The Restaurants Should Not Be Rewarded With Gratuity It Is That Bad 3) Undue Rewards Demotivates Staff Customer Service  Not Promote It 4) Nondiscriminate Staff Rewards Will Always Cause Friction Between Staff And Poison The Team And Culture Of The Establishment,,,,,
,4177,Yes  Please Respond To Me Email Listing All The Things That Were Wrong With The Room And Give Me A Refund If You Want Us To Give Bc A Second Chance.,,,,,
,4186,I Hope We Come For Our Chrimbo Bash Next Year,,,,,
,4188,Stay As Usual Excellent  Only Comment Is That When Walking Back From The Hotel To Our Lodge (Jaystone) There Was No Lighting On The Small Stone Staircase To The Side And The Immediate Path Down To The Lodges - In The Evening It Was Very Dark And Difficult With The Kids.,,,,,
,4189,Breakfast.  This Was The Only Area Where We Had Any Complaints. A Catalogue Of Errors For Each Of The Two Morning Breakfasts. Wrong Food Being Served To People And On The Second Morning We Had To Ask Three Times To Three Different People To Bring A Banana To The Table. And Then When They Finally Did It Was A Very Bruised And Over-Ripe Banana. In The End We Went Back To The Room To Get A Banana! For Some Reason Breakfast Was A Problem Area. Everything Else Was Excellent.,,,,,
,4192,I Do Hope If The Hotel Is Not Sold By Next Year  That The Service Levels Will Get Better.,,,,,
,4197,We Have Come To Accept That When We Order From The Lodge Menu That The Meal Is Not Delivered As Promised. On This Occasion It Was On Time But 2 Of The 4 Items Were Not Delivered Initially Or Were Incomplete. However On This Occasion The Staff Made Good The Mistakes Rapidly And With Apologies,,,,,
,4198,Loved Our Falconry Experience !,,,,,
,4201,Final Account Was Incorrect But Easily Rectified.,,,,,
,4203,We Never Had Such A Service Charge For All The........ At A Hotel In The World. Sorry  This Ist Really To High And Absolutely Not Correct. Not In 3 Star/4Star And 5 Or 6/7 Star Hotel  Not In England/Scotland....... A Service Charge Is For The People  That Works Friendly And Good ........,,,,,
,4205,The Whole Experience Did Not Meet The Initial Expectations Which Were Very Well Fulfilled On Arrival.,,,,,
,4209,If The Service Charge Is Discretionary  Make That Apparent And Ask Guests If They Want To Pay It. Don't Add It By Default  It Hardly Makes It Discretionary!,,,,,
,4210,A Big Thanks You To Everyone Involved In My Stay,,,,,
,4211,Brilliant Stay - No Complaints At All,,,,,
,4213,The Hotel Was Far To Hot And The Lunch Time Dinning Experience Was Poor. For Me This Lets The Hotel Down. I Have To Say The Staff Were Some Of The Best I Have Encountered And Are A Real Asset To The Hotel. Well Done!!,,,,,
,4216,Thank You For A Lovely Break.,,,,,
,4222,We Departed In The Middle Of The Night And Had Announced This To Staff. Our Car However Was Blocked By Other Cars  Some Of The Baggage Had Already Been Loaded Without Notifying The Night Porter. This Caused Confusion And A Delay. Front Desk Should Leave Clear Instructions For Night Porter.,,,,,
,4225,No,,,,,
,4228,We Are Returning In A Larger Group In August And Staying In The Lodges. It Would Be Lovely If You Provided A Small Selection Of Soft Drinks/Tea/Coffee Bits Just As You Do In The Rooms To Welcome You Into The Lodge. We Also Hope That We Will Have The Same Lovely Toiletries Provided - It Is Difficult To Tell From The Website And We Forgot To Ask.,,,,,
,4229,I Am Disappointed At The Mistakes I Have Listed Above  Especially As We Spent £1000 On A Two Night Stay. It Should Have Been Perfect.  However  The Location And Facilities Made Up For It  However It Should Not Be Like That. We Have Enjoyed Two Separate Visits To The London Ritz This Year And I Really Think Somebody From Your Hotel Should 'Secret Shop' There To See How 5 Star Should Be Done!!!! Howeve  I Have Recommended My Close Friend Mark La Cock Visit You With His Wedding In Mind Next Year  So If He Does Come  I Hope You Will Totally Look After Him  As He Is Marrying A Spanish Lady And He Is South African So There Will Be Many International Guests If He Does Choose Your Venue.,,,,,
,4232,My Husband And Son Really Enjoyed Both The Falconry And Quad Biking Activities. The Quad Bike Person At The Venue Was Particularly Pleasant.,,,,,
,4234,Some Friends Ordered A Bottle Of Champagne And A Card To Be In Our Room On Arrival - It Wasn't There And Never Materialised During Our Stay Despite Them Having A Long Conversation With The Bar Manager About The Type Of Champagne.  We Were Congratulated On Our Silver Wedding When We Arrived So The Hotel Knew The Occasion - Our Friends Were Very Disappointed That We Did Not Receive Their Gift.,,,,,
,4236,On Our Previous Two Visits To Bovey Castle  My Wife And I Enjoyed The Overall Experience Very Much. This Visit Was A Major Disappointment. I Recieved Far Too Many Apologies From The Staff. I Was In Two Minds On Whether To Pay The Discretionary Service Charge  But Upon Leaving  I Just Wanted No More Hassle  Pay And To Leave As Quick As Possible  Because I Could Feel Myself Getting Stressed. I Shall Be Writing To The Hotel Manager In The Near Future With More Details. In My Opinion  The Hotel Has Lost It's Sparkle And A Star. Hopefully  You Can Turn This Around Before It Gets Worse.,,,,,
,4238,The Hotel Promotes Itself On Quiet Relaxation. We Were Disappointing By The Sound Of Maintenance (Mowers  I Think) Too Early (8.00Am) And Too Close To The House.,,,,,
,4239,The Decor Could Do With Tweaking. In The Morning Room (?) There Was A Great Sideboard And Modern Sofas But Then A Couple Of Rather Naff Mini Chairs That Served No Purpose And Didn't Look Like Particularly Interesting Antiques.  Some Of The Art On Display Was Great And Again Some Looked Like It Had Been Left Over From Before The Hotel Was Refurbished And Just Used To Fill Wall Space.  A Few More Comfy Sofas Would Be Good Rather Than The Leather Ones Which Are Quite Chilly To Sit On. The Fire In The Bar Area - It Had Gone Out And The Girl Said She Wasn't Very Good At Lighting Fires. If You Are Going For The Shooting Lodge Style There Needs To Be Roaring Fires  Comfy Sofas And A Feeling Of Being A Bit Spoilt.,,,,,
,4241,This Was My Second Stay; Not Of My Choice  Although It Is A Nice Venue. The Hotel Is Pleasant  But Nowhere Near As Good As The Price Tag Suggests. By Charging As Much As You Do  Then You Raise The Expectations And This Wasn't Terribly Evident. The Old Adage Is That You Only Enjoy What You Pay For And  By That Standard  The Price Is High  So People Will Be Picky. I Have Had The Same Quality Of Service For Much Less  More Recently And That Disappoints. I Was Hoping To Come Away With The Same Feeling As In 2011. Your Standards Have Dropped  But Your Prices Haven't.,,,,,
,4242,I Had A Delightful Time!  I Injoyed The Guided Walk The Guides Were Fun And Outstanding!  I Appreciated The Eagle Experience Up At The Barn!,,,,,
,4245,It Was A Memorable Stay And We Would Love To Come Again At Some Stage.,,,,,
,4251,The Fishing Tuition Was Excellent And Very Enjoyable- Better Than Others I've Experienced.,,,,,
,4255,We Did Look For Croquet Equipment At One Point And It Seemed To Go Missing.  Also  It Seemed That Bicylces Were Taken And Kept At Several Of The Lodges  Rather Than Being Used And Then Returned.  We Weren't Sure If This Was Common Practice.  It Didn't Really Affect Us Since We Had Other Plans  But We Thought That It Might Be Something To Consider.  Also  The Pool Being Closed To Kids At 5:30 Seemed A Bit Too Early And It Wasn't Mentioned Up Front.  We Actually Took Our Kids At 5:45 (Clearly Dressed For The Pool) And No One Bothered To Advise Us.  But We Learned And Adjusted Accordingly.  Maybe Add Another 1-2 Hours For Kids In The Evening  Or Provide An Adult Swim Lane.,,,,,
,4257,Wasn't Quite As Wheelchair Friendly As It Could Have Been  We Weren't Told Of The Steps (Four) To Reach The Spa Although Staff Aware Of Wheelchair Dependancy At Time Of Booking. But Staff Were More Than Helpful Physically Lifting The Chair And Occupant Up And Down Them.,,,,,
,4263,On A Small Point  When Ordering Wine By The Glass We Felt It Should Have Been Pointed Out To Us That The Recommended Wine Was £15/Glass....The Barman Made No Mention Of The This When Putting It Forward.  We Left Feeling The Recommendation Had Been Made Purely On Profitability Grounds.,,,,,
,4264,We Think The Bathrooms Need A Total Overhaul To Bring Them Up To The Standard Expected. Also  The Axminster Carpet In The Corridoors Has Lots Of Stains.,,,,,
,4266,Bovey Has Always Provided A Guaranteed Experience. I Have To Say  If I Were Trying To Impress Business Clients Then  This Time Bovey Would Have Fallen Short Of The Mark  As There Were Too Many Little Niggles Which Took The Edge Off The Stay,,,,,
,4267,Resurfacing The Drive With Wet Tar Outside The Lodges In Winter - Not A Bright Idea,,,,,
,4269,Have Said It All In The Restaurant Section! Craig  During Our Archery Chats Made A Comment That He Was Shocked How Many People 'Just Come To Bovey Castle To Complain'. I Find This Deeply Depressing But I'm Sure It Is True. I Am Not One Of Those People.  I Like To Visit Fabulous Places  And If They Fall Short I Feel The Only Way To Make Things Better Is To Give Constructive Feedback.,,,,,
,4271,Gorgeous Place!! Very Special. I Would Say The Staff Needs More Training. Not As Professional As A 5 Star Resort.,,,,,
,4272,We Will Return,,,,,
,4274,The Swimming Pool Appears To Have Children In It All Day Meaning Not Quiet Pool Time For Adults Unless They Go During Breakfast Or Right Before Dinner. Why Pander To Children? They Should Be Allowed In The Pool Between 10-3Pm Or 11- 4Pm  After All It Is Adults That Are Paying For A Relaxing Experience - Not To Be Screeched At Or Splashed.,,,,,
,4275,I Was Disappointed With The Cider And Sloe Gin Making  The Member Of Staff Was Attentive And Very Friendly  But There Were No Sloes And No Cider To Taste As It Had All Gone Acidic. The Mature Sloe Gin Has Accidentally Been Poured Away Apparently. For This We Paid £60  (We Were Over Charged By £20) It Was No A Lesson. We Have A Cider Orchard And Knew The Basics  All We Did Was Churn Up Apples!,,,,,
,4276,I Have Since Received An Email Offering Rooms From £85 A Night  I Paid £279-249 For One Adult And Child... After Negotiating With Federico Who Original Quoted In The Region Of £389  This Is Extremely Frustrating As Had The Rate Been More Sensible I Would Have Stayed Much Longer. These Rates Should Not Vary So Much  There Should Be A Reasonable Rate Charged At All Times. This Does Not Induce Regulars To Be Loyal. However I Did As Always Have A Lovely Stay And Would Love To Revisit  I Look Forward To Your Reply. Kind Regards  Sue Challacombe,,,,,
,4277,We Would Very Much Like To Return To Bovey But I Will Base My Decision On Confirmation That Essential Maintenance Has Been Carried Out In Preparation For The Next Holiday Season.,,,,,
,4278,We Love Bovey Castle But The Food Was A Real Disappointment.,,,,,
,4279,As A Prize Winner I Expected Everything To Have Been Taken Care Of And Not To Be Troubled By The Embarrassment Of Having To Sort Out Problems With The Bill.,,,,,
,4280,Toilet Needed Maintenance On Arrival  Had To Wait To Be Seated For Breakfast  Waited An Unacceptable Amount Of Time For A Pot Of Tea And When It Came It Was So Weak I Wished We Had Ordered Coffee But Did Not Have All Day To Wait For It  Acceptable Continental Breakfast Nothing More  Service Painful.,,,,,
,4281,We Were Given A Tour Of The Hotel Which Was Just To Show Us The Facilities. Would Have Liked To Have Heard More About The History Of The Building As Well.,,,,,
,4282,I Know The Hotel Is For Sale.. But It Does Need Investment In Decor In Several Areas,,,,,
,4283,Great Break & Will Certainly Return.,,,,,
,4284,We May Have Had Overly High Expectations But They Certainly Were Not Met. Nothing Could Have Been Described As 'Excellent'. The Manager Was Very Good  He Needs To Train His Staff To Provide The Same High Standards Of Customer Service.,,,,,
,4285,Attention To Detail!  No Falconery Experience On The Monday And Told At Check In That If Weather Bad Would Be Indoors  A Let Down,,,,,
,4289,Extremely Disappointed And Quite Frankly It Ruined Our Anniversary. Not Much More To Say Than I Wish We Had Gone To The St Moritz  Cornwall...And It Would Have Been Much Cheaper!,,,,,
,4290,Beautiful Setting - Lodges Perfect For Families And Dogs Although Decore Looking A Little Tatty  Please Get Service Levels Sorted We Want To Be Able To Return But Have Real Reservations About Doing So,,,,,
,4294,Suggest You Introduce A Service Charge Cap For Parties/Organised Groups To Make Things Easier. My Entire Service Charge Would Have Been Around £175  I Did Not Pay This But Added An Amount I Thought Was Reasonable When Taking Into How Much We Had Spent Over The Five Days.,,,,,
,4295,There Was No Hot Breakfast Left On My 2Nd Morning At 9.00  Was Told I'd Have To Order A La Carte And Pay For It.,,,,,
,4296,Thoroughly Enjoyed The Time With You.  The Negative Comments Above Didnt Really Detract From The Stay But Arent What Would Be Expected With A Five Star Hotel So I Thought It Important To Highlight Them.  Otherwise Thank You To You And Your Team For Looking After Us So Well.,,,,,
,4298,Was A Little Surprised To See A Surcharge Made On My Bill Which Goes To Members Of Staff. This Should Really Be Explained Before Hand. Dare I Say  While The Whole Epxerience Was Fantastic (3Rd Xmas Party With Yourselves) I Would Have Thought This Extra Charge Should Be Negotiated Either With The Company Or Made Clear It Is Optional Before Being Put On The Bill.,,,,,
,4301,I Think The 'Discretionary' 12.5% Service Really Should Be Scrapped. It Leaves No Room For Us To Recognise Exceptional Service As We Experience It And It Certainly Shouldn't Be Applied When A Barman Has Simply Brought You A Couple Of Brandies At The End Of The Evening. A Place Of The Calibre Of Bovey Castle Shouldn't Be Doing This - It Should Trust To Genuinely Excellent Service To Deliver Its Own Volunatary Rewards! I Also Think That Where There Is Little 'Value Added' Drinks Are Overpriced. £14.00 For A G&T Is Just Silly; Whereas £70.00 For A Bottle Of Wine We Wouldn't Have Found Or Tried On Our Own Is Absolutely Fair Enough. Overall  Though  Your People Are Fantastic  The Ambience Is Great And The Food Superb.  I Hope This Helps. Best Regards  Ingrid Heseltine,,,,,
,4303,Final Account Was Not In Accordance With Reservation Confirmation,,,,,
,4304,Overall We Liked Bovey Castle. We Spent Over £700 In 24 Hours And Didn't Get The Feeling It Was Good Value.,,,,,
,4305,Apparently Drinks Were Missed Off Our Bill. I Was Told Initially Three Drinks(Which Was A Mistake In Itself) And Suggested That Our Overcharge In The Bistro Could Be Used Against The Amount Owing. This Must Have Fallen On Deaf Ears As An Amount Has Been Charged To My Amex Account....Admittedly Only For Two Drinks.,,,,,
,4306,My Partners Company Occassionally Has To Entertain Many Foreign Customers From Around The World And We Had Hoped That This Could Be A 'One Stop' Venue We Could Use  As The Spa Facilities Would Help Keep The Wives And Partners Amused During The Day. We Also Thought About Having A Small Weeding At Your Venue So Our Guests Could Enjoy All The Facilities. Unfortunately We Left With Doubts.,,,,,
,4307,We Enjoyed The Stay And The Beautiful Location. The Hotel Has Massive Poitential But Sadly Fell Below Our Expectations. The Lodges Are Relatively New But Already Looked Tired - Peeling Wallpaper  The Towel Rail In Our Room Was Only Held On By One Connection  Tv Picture Was Poor,,,,,
,4308,Overall  I Thought The Hotel Was Lovely. I Have Read A Series Of Negative Reviews On Trip Advisor But It Seems To Me Some People Are Determined To Find Fault. Although I Did See One Dead Pot Plant I Would Have Liked To Get Rid Of!! Other Positives: The Falconry Display Was Lovely (Tho It Is The Owls I Really Fell For) Also Loved The Walled Garden And The Cocktails.,,,,,
,4309,The Service In The Lounge Areas Was Very Poor  We Waited For 15 Minutes Then Had To Approach Staff And Asked To Be Served.,,,,,
,4310,You Have Thought Of Everything Else For Guests Staying Just Needs Some Fine Tuning To Make It Perfect.,,,,,
,4314,Lovely Birthday Surprise.,,,,,
,4319,Keep Up The Great Work And Thank You For Allowing Us To Escape The Chaos Of London In Your Oasis.,,,,,
,4323,Hotel Is Over Rated And Over Priced.  I Got A Deal On The Room (Only 200 A Night!!) And Was Treated Like A Second Class Citizen. Worst Room In The Hotel.  The Pool Is A Joke - Why Do You Allow The Kids To Take Over?  No Lap Lane???  The Noodles And Floats Are Dog Eaten -Really?? They Cost Only One Pound - Can't The Hotel Provide Water Tools - For Adults And Kids Alike?  A Travelodge Is Run Better And Cleaner And Friendlier Than This Place!,,,,,
,4326,We Brought Both Chuildren And Dog With Us Which Was A Great Experience Both Because Of Welcome From The Hotel And The Lovely Walks Nearby.,,,,,
,4327,When You Are In The Luxury Hotel Trade You Need To Meet The Expectations Of Your Customers Otherwise You Are An Average Hotel Charging Luxury Hotel Prices.,,,,,
,4328,Thank You For The Nice Experience,,,,,
,4331,I Stronglysuggest That Bovey And Portico Work On Their Travel And Arrival Coordinations.,,,,,
,4338,Seems Surprising That Breakfast Is Not Included In The Price...,,,,,
,4341,We Look Forward  To Your Comments By E Mail.,,,,,
,4342,Loved The Children's Slippers And Rubber Duck In The Room On Arrival - A Really Nice Touch. Loved All The Bits And Pieces For Children: The Chickens  Birds  Birds Of Prey  Trampoline And Playbarn. Also Enjoyed The Fudge Left In The Room The First Evening  But Thought It A Bit Strange That None Was Left On Subsequent Evenings. Very Grateful That Someone In Reception (Please Thank Her From Me) Kindly Sent Us The Little Teddy Bear That Lily Left In The Playbarn. Overall  We Had A Lovely Stay In Beautiful Surroundings  Despite A Few Minor Disappointments.,,,,,
,4346,We Love Bovey Castle And Have Stayed In February For The Last 3 Years.  The Activities For The Children Are Excellent And We Love The Overall Friendly And Relaxing Atmosphere.  Hope To Be Back Again Next Year!  Thank You.,,,,,
,4347,Hope There Is A Successful Sale Soon That Allows For Some Investment And Some Reduction In Prices.,,,,,
,4348,Very Enjoyable Stay - We'll Be Back Again Next Year!,,,,,
,4351,No Comments As Such Just A Favour If It’S Permitted. We Took Some Lovely Pictures Of The Hotel And Grounds But Missed Our Chance Just To Get A Picture Of The Staff In There Tweed Uniform Which Would Finish The Album Off Perfectly. If You Can Just Email A Picture Back That Would Be Great If Not Then It’S Not A Problem.,,,,,
,4355,The Falconary Display Was Excellent And Very Well Presented With Lots Of Humour!,,,,,
,4358,Lack Of Access To Lounges Due To Private Functions And Preboooked Teas Meant Facilities Not Available.,,,,,
,4359,We Have On Our Final Account Over £23.00 Of Service Charges And The Suggestion Above Is That These Are Discretionary Which Was Not Explained To Us And Not Known So Were Paid Without Even Questioning Them. This Is Completely Wrong. We Rang On Sunday Morning After Our Stay To Report That We Were Suffering Sickness And Diarrhoea. The Manager Was Not Available So We Left A Message Including Our Phone Number And Have Heard Nothing. We Think We Have Had The Norovirus And Given The Incubation Period And Our Movements Feel Sure This Was Caught At The Hotel. With These 2 Situations I Wonder If The Excellent Customer Service I Have Referred To In This Survey Is Just A Facade.,,,,,
,4361,To Summarize  Whilst The General Quality Of The Hotel Is 5 Star  The Dining Room Experience Is Certainly Not. We Base Our Comments On Our Experience Of Staying At Many 5 Star Hotels Throughout Europe Including Many Of Those Others Affiliated To Small Luxury Hotels Of The World. The Overall Experience Was Certainly Not Worth £800 Per Day. Considering The Close Competition You Have In Gidleigh Park And A Michelin Star Chef  You Need To Address This Issue Urgently.,,,,,
,4362,Front Desk Staff On Leaving Where Only Just Doing A Job  Not Very Friendly Or Talkative  I Thought They Wanted Us To Go So They Could Continue Their Own Chat. A Bit Sad,,,,,
,4364,We Also Wanted Afternoon Tea On Our Arrival  But Due To Every Horizontal Surface Bearing A Table Cloth And Reserved Notice (Day B4 Mothers Day) We Had To Forgo This Also.,,,,,
,4370,I Think You Have A Serious Management Problem.  I Was Absolutely Astounded That The Duty Manager That We Spoke To Did Not Where Bedroom 32 (I Think) Was Despite Being At The Hotel 5 Years.  If Your Management Team Stopped Hiding In Their Office And Got Out And Walked The Floors  Talked To The Staff And Inspected The Bedrooms / Public Rooms Then I Expect You Would See A Dramatic Improvement In Quality.  With Proper Management New Staff Members Would Be Properly Supervised (Staff Turnover Might Even Drop) And People Would Not Be Rooms With Leaking Roofs At £350 A Night.  I Look Forward To Receiving A Full And Appropriate Apology From The Hotel.,,,,,
,4376,I Am A Serving Soldier Currently Overseas And Had Come Back To England For Only 3 Days In Which I Was Hoping To Have A Romantic Getaway With My Partner.  I Had Stayed At The Bovey Castle 7 Years Ago And Had Enjoyed Every Second Of It So Was Hoping For The Same This Time.  However  It Could Not Have Been So Different.  We Both Left So Very Dissappointed And Angry At The Whole Weekend.  I Had Saved The Money Especially To Make It A Special Getaway And Feel That It Was Completely Wasted.  We Were Made To Feel Unworthy Of Staying In A Place Like Bovey Whereby Other Guests Were Pampered In Every Way.  Completely Disappointed With The Whole Experience.,,,,,
,4377,Yes Could You Move The Hotel To West Yorkshire Then We Could Visit More Often!!!!,,,,,
,4378,A Wonderful Experience  I Loved It  Thank You,,,,,
,4379,We Feel The Discretionary Service Charge Should Be Pointed Out To Guests At Check-In,,,,,
,4382,One Last Thing.  I Was Pleased To Find A Small Bottle Of Fresh Milk In The Fridge As I Hate Uht.  Unfortunately It Stayed There For 2 Days After Its Sell By Date And Then Was Not Replaced With Anything So I Had To Have Drinks Without Milk For The Last 2 Days.  The Views From Our Room And The Hotel In General Are Lovely And I Did Enjoy My Stay Despite My Comments But This Was Probably Because The Weather Was Beautiful. I Feel The Service Should Be Improved To Justify Charging Such High Prices For Food  Drinks And Service.,,,,,
,4383,I Used To Think Cliveden Was The Best Country House Hotel For Dogs.  I Believe Bovey Surpassed It.  You Should Make Yourselves Better Known To Dog Owners.  We Only Happened To Hear About You Through Ben Fogel.  There Are A Great Deal Of People Who  Want To Take Their Dogs On Holiday With Them.  Its A Market You Should Tap.,,,,,
,4386,When I Asked To See If There Were Any Spaces For A Massage For The Next Day I Was Told It Was Completely Booked - It Would Be Nice If The Guests Were Contacted Or Given A Preferred Status If Indeed Your Spa Is Used By Non-Guests,,,,,
,4387,Love The Daily Falconry Demo,,,,,
,4389,Did Not Get Repeat Wake Up Call And Therefore Was Late To Airport And Missed My Flight,,,,,
,4390,I Though The Hotel Setting Was Beautiful But Internally Apart From The Main Reception Areas There Were Several Areas (Especially In The Stairwells)  Where The Carpets Were Thread Bare And There Were Quite A Few Trip Hazzards Which Surprised Me. The Hotel Porters Were Especiall Welcoming And Helpful.,,,,,
,4396,I Work For A Large Japanese Corporation And Stay At Hotels All Over The World And Arrange For My Management Team And Colleagues To Do The Same. I Have Never  At Any Hotel  Had Need To Complain  Especially When Rated So Highly. I Would Also Always Pay Any Service Charge As I Have Now. I Will Certainly Not Look To Stay With Your Hotel And  If Asked  Will Certainly Not Endorse You. Extremely Poor All Round I Am Afraid.            ,,,,,
,4400,The Manger Is A Credit To This Hotel It His Staff In The Restaurant That Let Him Done,,,,,
,4403,A Top Quality Establishment.  Well Done.,,,,,
,4404,No,,,,,
,4405,Smoke Alarm Needed Maintenance  - At 3Am! Night Porter Attended To This Quickly  But Not Ideal,,,,,
,4408,What A Let Down So Looking Forward To Our Break,,,,,
,4414,The Hotel Is A Wonderful Gem On Dartmoor.,,,,,
,4415,No,,,,,
,4417,Require Vat For Booking.........,,,,,
,4418,I Have Stayed In Many Very Exclusive Hotels Over The Years (Hell  I Was Was Brought Up In One!) But Bovey Castle Is Without Doubt The Best  Most Relaxing And Enjoyable Experience I Have Experienced. It Made Our Wedding Anniversary Very Special And We Will Be Back. Thank You.,,,,,
,4419,The Food In The Edwardian Grill Was Superb - Such A Pity The Restaurant Was Let Down By Poorly Trained Staff. The Bad Service Has Put Us Off Returning.   Also Having To Spoken To Friends And Collegues Living In Devon It Appears That Bad Service Is A Feature At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,4420,Very Disappointed With Our Stay :(,,,,,
,4422,None,,,,,
,4424,Sadly There Is Hardly Any Mobile Reception,,,,,
,4426,Thank You Very Much - A Lovely Situation And A Great Place To Spend Some Time.,,,,,
,4428,We Didn't Realise How Dog Friendly The Castle Was Until We Turned Up. Next Time We Might Bring Our Dog. Advertising That Reception Are Prepared To Look After The Dogs While We Dine Or Are In The Spa Would Have Been Useful.,,,,,
,4429,My Teenage Daughter Was Frustrated By The Lack Of Mobile Signal Inthe Area But As Busy Professionals  My Husband And I Regarded The Lack Of Signal As A Complete Opportunity To Relax And Switch Off Completely From Work Related Matters!,,,,,
,4435,Wine Was Very Expensive. One Bottle I Know I Could Buy For £8 But Was Charged At £32.  We Stayed The Following Night At Thornbury Castle Their Wine List Was Shorter But Still Had Some Really Decent Wines Alongside A Better Choice In The £30 Bracket,,,,,
,4436,Staff Is Always Friendly And Helpful  But Do Not Always Give The Impression To Have A Lot Of Working Experience In Luxury Hotels Or High-End Service Industry  Nor Formation Therein.,,,,,
,4440,Overall  And In Hindsight  The Things We Enjoyed Were The Room; The Pool; The Breakfast; The Falconry Display But We Felt Massively Let Down By The Dining Experience In The Evening.,,,,,
,4444,For The Golf There Were No Course Guides And On The Course Very Little Signs Showing You To The Next Tee Or No Clear Distance Markers To The Green,,,,,
,4445,Bar Service In General Poor.,,,,,
,4446,Internet Charges Had Been Applied Too Many Times,,,,,
,4448,Breakfast Was Very Good. Unfortunately Overall This Particular Stay Fell Below My Reasonable Expectations For A £350+ A Night Room With Only Breakfast It Lacked Although The Building Is Impressive As Are The Grounds And The Falconry Display Was Excellent As Usual. The Playroom And Staff Was Also Excellent. Feeding Chickens And Ferrets Was Fun For Children And Well Staffed.,,,,,
,4450,A Lovely Property  Very Friendly Staff  And With A Few Tweaks  Customer Service Would Be Exemplary.,,,,,
,4451,We Did Not Realise The Service Charge Was Discretionary As It Seemed Excessive When We Only Had A Cup Of Tea Or A Drink Would Not Necessarily Have Paid That But We Were Happy To Pay In Restaurant And High Tea,,,,,
,4453,We Couldn't Understand The Breakfast Menu  To Pay £14.95 For A Fried Egg Seemed A Bit Much.,,,,,
,4454,No,,,,,
,4458,Do Not Like Having Service Charges Added To Bill  It Should Be Customers Choice,,,,,
,4465,Raise Your Game In The Bistro And It Will Make A Big Difference,,,,,
,4467,A Second Very Enjoyable Stay  Marred Somewhat By A Dreadful Meal In The Castle Bistro  But Everything Else Was Superb. Your Staff Do You Credit.,,,,,
,4469,We Have Stayed Twice Now And Been Very Impressed Generally. We Were In One Of The Lodges And I Think Having A Suggestion Book In Each One So That Guests Could Report Niggles Eg Lack Of Teaspoons  Very Noisy Toilet Cisterns ( That Need Replacing - Just Had The Same Thing Done At Home!) I Think Most General Maintenance Issues Are Only Noticed By Those Staying In The Lodges And Are Unlikely To Be Reported To A Busy 5 Star Hotel Reception! A Book Would Mean That At The End Of A Stay These Snagging Issues Could Be Dealt With And Ticked Off So That People Would See That Things Do Get Done. I Am Not Suggesting That Things Are Not Generally In Good Condition Because They Are But Several Things Needed Attention Which We Did Not Report - Others Must Have Done Similar Before Us.,,,,,
,4470,Improve Service. It Seems To Have Gone Downhill Since Our Last Visit.,,,,,
,4471,Yet Again We Throughly Enjoyed Our Stay With You. Only A Couple Of Observations For You To Be Aware Of : In Ingle Tor We Noted That The Toilet In The Main Bedroom En Suite Was Awkward To Flush  A Down Light Just Inside The Entrance Was Missing Its Holding Wire - Not Anything That We Felt Warranted Immediate Attention During Our Stay.,,,,,
,4474,Better Than Our Last Trip 18 Months Ago  When It Felt Too Corporate.,,,,,
,4475,Needs To Be Cleaner.  Seems Like You Are Not Maintaining The Hotel.  Are You Selling It?,,,,,
,4477,Bathrooms Do Not Cost A Vast Amount To Refurbish On The Grand Scale Of Things ......................Hotel Of This Calibre Should Be Top End,,,,,
,4479,I Was Delighted With The Place  The Staff And How We Were Looked After  More Like House-Guests Than Customers. Very Well Done Indeed!,,,,,
,4480,Having Read The Reviews On Trip Adviser Before We Arrived  We Were A Little Apprehensive  Yes We Were Advised There Would Be A 5% Service Charge But We Were Not Told This Was Discretionary And We Paid It.  Overall We Had A Positive Experience And Enjoyed Our Stay At Bovey Castle.,,,,,
,4481,Thouroughly Enjoyed Our Stay,,,,,
,4484,Overall A Very Disappointing And Very Expensive Weekend. We Stayed At Bovey Castle As We Thought It Would Be Very Special And Be Relaxing. It Is A Very Overrated Hotel  We Have Stayed In Many 5* Hotels And Bovey Certainly Did Not Live Up To Our Expectations At All. In Fact We Didnt Even Stay On Our Last Night And Checked Out A Day Early As We Did Not Want To Spend Another £500! A Couple Of Days After We Arrived Home  We Received An Invoice To Say That We Had Been Charged For Our Last Night Withouteven Telling Us. This Has Now Been Resolved After Two Weeks  But We Were Told That The Hotel Didn't Know We Had Checked Out!! Even Though We Had Paid A £1200 Bill And Returned Our Room Key!,,,,,
,4487,We Were Bought The Hotel Stay As A Wedding Gift.  We Thought The Buildings And Grounds Were Fabulous.  The Reception Was Efficient And The Room Was Nice And Clean.  The Staff Were Polite.  The Rest Of It Was Quite Poor.  It Was A Shame As It Ruined It For Us.  When We Were Shown Around  The Guide Was Talking To Us About The Parrott And Said The 'F' Word Twice.  We Thought That Was A Bit Unnecessary.  When We Ordered Drinks  Every Order Was Delivered Incorrectly.  The Cost Of The Drinks Were Ludicrous.  The Cream Tea Was A Disgrace For £15 And Our Friend Order A Large Coffee Which Came Out In A Small Cup And Cold And Then The Waitress Forgot To Bring The Second Cup.  Dinner Was Ok.  Definitely Not Worth The Cost.  Breakfase Was Poor.  The Buffett Was Poor.  The Cooked Breakfast Was Poor.  We Ordered Pancakes Which Came Out (Including The Bacon) Burnt.  You Have A Beautiful House In Beautiful Grounds But I Doubt We Will Return.,,,,,
,4490,Breakfast Was Poor. We Din't Get Served Milk With Our Coffee And Had To Ask. No Toast Was Delivered And Again We Had To Ask. The Hot Buffet Breakfast Was Luke Warm At Best. Plenty Of Staff Around But Missing The Personal Touch.,,,,,
,4493,We Loved The Beauty Around The Castle And Enjoyed The Gardens. It Was Just Disappointing That The Food Was A Disappointment. There Is No Excuse For Cold Coffee Or Burnt Food In A 5 Star Establishment.,,,,,
,4498,Following A Long Wait At Breakfast  We Waited A Further 10 Minutes At The Door For Our Car (When We Checked Out  We Advised Reception That We Were Returning To The Room To Collect Our Bags  And Would Be Ready To Leave).  The Porter Had The Keys In His Hand  So My Husband Took The Keys And Collected The Car Himself.,,,,,
,4499,Please Dont Change Anything-Cant Wait To Come Back,,,,,
,4500,I Understand Your Not A Boutique Hotel And Therefore Have More Foot Fall But Ruffled Threadbare Carpets Do Not Do Your Hotel And Staff Justice. Although I Did Not See Any Other Rooms As I Said Number 35 Was A Little Disappointing But As We Paid A Cheap Price We Out Weighed This Against That Wether That's Right It Wrong ......?,,,,,
,4501,Don't Charge Paying For Things Like Internet Access. It Just Cheapens The Overall Experience. Similarly 'Discretionary' Service Charges Should Not Appear 'Compulsory' On The Final Bill. Up Front It's A Costly 5 Star Experience  Unnecessary Charges Cheapen The Experience And Lessens The Likelihood Of My Making A Return Visit.,,,,,
,4502,The Hotel Is Shabby  Dirty And The Staff Can Not Greet. I Have Never Seen Such A Bad 5 Star Hotel.,,,,,
,4503,It Is (Or Could Be) A Beatiful Hotel And Venue.  It Is Not However A Five Star Hotel  And One Gets The Impression That You Have To Pay For (And Over The Odds) For Many Things That Would Be Complementary/Inclusive At Competitor Hotels.  You Don't Even Provide Complementary Newspapers  For Goodness Sake!!  Perhaps Most Importantly  The Hotel Does Not Have Dedicated Animal-Free Rooms.  As A Result I Suffered Asthma/Itchy Eyes  Even Though We Requested An Animal-Free Room.  The Only Way It Was Allocated To Us Was By Looking Back Through The History Of What Had/Had Not Stayed In There - Incredible.,,,,,
,4504,A Great Experience!,,,,,
,4506,Have Stayed In 4* Hotels With Better Food And Bedroom Furnishing. Also Would Have Prefered To Have Rewarded Those Staff That Gave Good Service  Without Having The 12.5% Service Charge On Food And Beverages  And 5% On All Other Chargable Items.  We Would Return  But Not At The 5* Prices.,,,,,
,4507,No..Enough Said!,,,,,
,4508,The Steak My Wife Ordered And My Beef Wellington Was Truly Excellent And Worth Every Penny. The Rhubard In The Mille Feuille Was Far Too Hard For My Liking And Could Only Be Cut With A Knife; Shame.  I Fully Understand Your Very Clear Liberal Dress Code  Or Lack Of It. But Would It Not Be Nice To Have A More Formal Dress Code For The Edwardian Grill Only? If You Do Not Want To Wear A Jacket Or Tie; Or Perhaps Jeans Is Your First Choice  Then Other Dining Areas Are Available?,,,,,
,4510,This Was An Extremely Expensive Hotel That Fell So Far Short Of The Standard Expected. There Was The Impression That There Were Too Many Guests /Special Parties To Allow The Kitchens To Cope. Having Such A Poor Dinner - I Seriously Considered Room Service But Knew It Would Probably Come From The Same Kitchen.  Service Was Slow And The Food Pretentious And Not Good - Breakfast Wasn't Much Better.,,,,,
,4511,Personally I Believe You Should Sell Draft Beers In Thr Cocktail Bar Because In My Opinion Every One Does Not Want Cocktails Just A Nice Fresh Cold Beer & If You Are Buisy & Short On Staff I Can Only Guess Its A Long Wait For One To Come From The Bistro Bar Plus Toilet Needs To Be Near Main Restraunt Long Way When Dinner Is On Your Table Going Cold,,,,,
,4512,Lovely Place  But Food Well Below Par  Even A Toasted Tea Cake Was Stone Cold !,,,,,
,4518,Thi Was A Birthday Weekend That Cost Overall A £1000 And Didnt Leave Up To The Impression I Was Expecting When I Originally Booked The Stay.,,,,,
,4520,Very Poor Value For Money. I Have Stayed At Much Better Hotels In Central London For This Amount.  Won't Be Staying Again  The Newly Refurbished Pub In A Local Village Offers Much Better Value For Money And Comfort.,,,,,
,4521,We Were Disappointed With Our Stay Overall But Did Enjoy Some Aspects Ie Golf  Level Of Accommodation And Location,,,,,
,4522,Overall A Great Experience  Thank U For The Good Rate And Upgrade. Best Part Of The Stay Was The Staff Which Were Great. Pls Do Take Feed Back As Constructive/Requested By You  And With The Good Intention They Have Been Given,,,,,
,4523,Thank You So Much. We Will Be Back!,,,,,
,4524,Having Stayed At Bovey On At Least 5 Other Occasions Since 2007 (It Was Our Favourite Hotel  We Couldn't Make That Claim Now)  We Found This Experience Significantly Different  In The Past Your Rooms Were Fabulously Presented  Staff Were Not Just Courteous  They Were Friendly And This Together With Your Facilities (Especially The Children’S Facilities Made The Place Wonderful). There Has Been An Overall Drop In Standards And This Is A Real Shame.,,,,,
,4527,Please Read My Trip Advisor Review,,,,,
,4531,Previous Stays Have Been Absolutely Excellent And Possibly My Expectation Levels Were Higher This Time Around.  Most Issues Surrounded Our Room And As Previous Rooms Have Been Faultless  Possibly We Were Just A Little Unlucky But Several Points (Tolilet  Remote Control  Plug Points  Wardrobe And Shower Attachment Must Be Relatively Long Standing).,,,,,
,4532,We Ate Lunch In The Bistro And The Food Took A Long Time After Our To Be Bought Out There As Well. When We Had A Drink In The Bar Before Our Meal In The Evening We Were Not Offered The Wine List.  The Service At Breakfast Was Excellent. Our Order Was Taken Straight Away And Was Brought Out A Few Minutes Later.,,,,,
,4533,My Only Regret Was That I Did Not Stay Longer ... And All Of Us In Our Group Wished That We Could Have Stayed On ... !   Thank You For The Kindness Shown To All Of Us Throughout Our Visit And For The Sweet And Kind 'Send Off' With The Gifts Of Treats  Etc.!  I Miss You All!  Tracy,,,,,
,4534,The Whole Experience Was Legendary  The Staff Fantastic And Fed Needs A Medal.,,,,,
,4537,One Day You Will Run Out Of Clientele,,,,,
,4538,Yes  You Property Is Not Even A Castle  Its A Manor House!. Your Advertising Is Both Misrepresented And Dishonest. I Will Make Certain That All The Necessary Travel Sites  And Their Customers In The Us Know The Full Story.,,,,,
,4539,Not Really  I Wish You Well. Unlikely We Will Return With Children And Hope Other People Provide Detailed Feedback.  A Few Simple Things Have Let Your Excellent Service Down  And You Don't Seem To Realise That If You Are Travelling The Almost 400 Miles Round Trip From London  An Extra Few Quid On The Rack Rate Is Not An Issue  If The Rooms Were More Comfortable. All The Very Best.  Bernard Brown (Surrey),,,,,
,4544,I Paid The Accomodation Discretionary Service Charge But Not The Bistro.  I Strongly Object To This Charge Automatically Included On Bills.  It Places The Customer In A Difficult Position As They Can Feel Too Embarrased To Ask For The Charge To Be Taken Off The Bill.  But Of Course  That Is No Doubt The Reason Why The Policy Was Introduced.  It Should Be Left To The Customer To Decide If They Wish To Pay A Gratuity For Good Service  Rather Than Being Put In The Emarrasing Situation Of Having To Refuse To Pay It.,,,,,
,4549,Please See Earlier Comments,,,,,
,4553,I Did Not Expect Ball Games By Children To Be Played Below My Bedroom Window Followed By A Temp Driving Range For All Of The Wedding Guests.,,,,,
,4554,Wish I Could Afford To Stay More Often!,,,,,
,4558,See You Next Year,,,,,
,4561,And A More Pleasant Treatment From The Employees From Audi  Than Just The Shouting 'You Can't Park Here!' Or 'You Can't Drive Here!' And So On.,,,,,
,4562,Yes Would Not Come Again And Would Not Recommend,,,,,
,4567,We Had A Lovely Time And The Castle And Grounds Are Absolutely Spectacular.  The Bed Was Very Comfortable As Well And The Front Desk Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,4568,Otherwise It Was Fabulous! Falconry Marvellous  But Terrible Jokes... The Birds Inside Too  Were Amazing! The Whole Place Is Utterly Lovely   And We Will Come Back For Christmas Probably,,,,,
,4569,Very Well Looked After  Great Team At Bovey  Excellent Venue.,,,,,
,4573,Regard My Answer To Q22 I'm Afraid That I Did Not Feel That My Experiance Was Quite As Good As Last Time I Visited.,,,,,
,4576,Whilst The Setting Was Lovely And Staff Polite And Welcoming When Tested With Problems... 1. 'Can I Borrow A Dog Bowl?' 2. (Pouring Down Outside) 'There Are No Umberellas In The Lobby Do You Have Any Elsewhere?' 3. 'You Failed To Bring The Drinks Order With Room Service'. The Responses Were Poor  1. I Waited 10 Minutes Then Took The One From Outside As No One Arrived. 2. 'No'. 3. 'What Drinks?' ,,,,,
,4579,The Stay Was  As Ever  Pretty Much Beyond Criticism And Very Enjoyable.,,,,,
,4580,I Am Not Sure The Bill Was Correct As It Seemed To Charge 7 Spa Treatments When There Were 6. Also The Dinner Supplement And Service Charge Is Confusing.,,,,,
,4582,We Had My Wife's Parents Staying And Booked Room 1 Which Was Almost Ideal - Only Comment Was That As A Room For Less Able Bodied People We Were Surprised That All Power Points Were At Floor Level And Despite Asking Several Times For An Extension Lead To Bring Power To A More Manageable Level One Never Materialised. Also The Bar And Outside Noise From Other Guests Was Very Noticeable With People Partying Loudly Until Past 02.30 Am Which Is Quite Unreasonable And Badly Managed. We Are Certainly Not Kill Joys But The Noise Was Going On Right Outside The Windows Of My Inlaws Room And If People Are Allowed To Drink Into The Early Hours Then A More Suitable Area Should Be Designated.,,,,,
,4584,I Think I Have Covered All Our Experiences In The 2 Days We Stayed.  We Were Able To Have A Chat With Federico And He Adjusted The Bill To Reflect A 'Free' Afternoon Tea.  I'm Afraid This Did Not Really Help Us To Feel Better About Our Experience Given The Over 700 Pounds Spent In Total.,,,,,
,4585,None,,,,,
,4587,I Was Very Disappointed With My Stay Due To Some Trouble Two Rooms From Mine  Which Resulted In Me Having To Get Dressed In The Early Hours And Intervene In A Fight To Split It Up  I Then Had To Give A Verbal Statement To The Police In By Which Time Returned To My Room Around 0400  Only For Me To Leave The Hotel At 0730 To Drive Back To London  So As For Value For Money I Think It Was Lacking Due To Only Spending Around Three Hours In My Room.,,,,,
,4590,I Recommend Bovey To Everyone Susceptible To Its Charms,,,,,
,4591,The Only Thing Needed Is An Upgrade On The Food Side Of Things......Otherwise The People And The Location In The Countryside Are Terrific.......Also The Help Given To Me In Setting Up The Conference Call By The Manager Federico Aresti Was Greatly Appreciated.....,,,,,
,4592,I Did Not Pay The Discretionary Service Charge But Added A Sum I Felt Appropriate To The Bill On Leaving. Maintenance Could Be Improved. Missing Screws In The Brass Floor Plates Covering The Door Springs In The Main Ground Floor Corridor Caused A Number Of People To Trip And Nearly Fall Over. Rule About Children Vacating The Pool Area Needs To Be More Rigorously Enforced. A Number Of Guests Were Irritated At Having To Share The Pool With Over Playful Youngsters.,,,,,
,4593,Although It Is A Most Magnificent Building And Grounds  Beautifully Kept And Lovely Staff. Overall We Were A Bit Disappointed In Our Stay. We Have Stayed At Many 5* Hotels Throughout Our Lives And Many 4* And To Be Fair The Quality Of The Dining Was Not Upto The 4*. Very Expensive And You Do Expect Exceptional Quality We Were Considering Bovey For Our Sons Wedding But We Feel Unsure. One Does Like Value For Money And We Came Away Feeling That We Had Not Had That.  ,,,,,
,4594,We Brought Two Dogs With Us.  We Were Very Pleasantly Surprised At How Welcome They Were Made - From Providing Dog Beds And Bowls In The Lodge To Giving Them Access Into The Hotel.  Really Appreciated.,,,,,
,4595,It Is A Beautiful Place/Location And We Might Come Again Because Of This. Spending In The Region Of £1800 I Expect To Be Able To Have A Sandwich Whenever I Want One - Or At Least To Be Treated Politely.,,,,,
,4597,Cooked Breakfast Was Poor. The Chef Did Not Seem To Understand The Concept Of 'Soft' Poached Eggs And I Suspect That The Bacon Was Cooked And Kept Hot For A Considerable Period Of Timee Before Being Served. The Discretionary Service Charge Which Was Added To Every Element Of The Bill Was Irritating And Although I Paid It I Paid It Reluctantly.In My View Guests Should Be Given The Choice As To Whether Or Not They Wish To Add A Sum To The Bill In Recognition Of Exceptional Service.,,,,,
,4599,Good Personal Touches From The Manager Federico (Greetings  Remembering Previous Visits Etc).,,,,,
,4600,I Was Surprised To Be Phoned Approx 4 Days Later By The Golf Pro Shop Because There Had Been A Mix Up With The Payment For Our Golf. Then A Week Later To Be Phoned By The Bistro Staff Because The Snack After Golf (£19) Had Been Mischarged. Sounds As If The Hotel Systems Need Checking! Overall We Had A Great Trip.,,,,,
,4602,I Paid Over £600 For An Overnight Stay  Dinner And Golf  I Was Bitterly Disappointed In Everything But The Golf. I Have Written A Similar Review On Tripadvisor As I Was So Upset,,,,,
,4605,This Was A Gift To Me From My Sisters For A 'Special' Birthday.  I Wouldn't Dream Of Making Comments At All Had You Not Emailed This Questionnaire.  But You Have.  So One Further Comment Is I Did Find It Strange That There Was A,,,,,
,4607,In The Light Of The Comments I Made At 23  We Would Be Very Disinclined To Come And Visit Again  Or Certainly To Consider Booking My Daughter's Wedding At Bovey Castle  As We Would Be Concerned That We Might Be Similarly 'Ripped Off' Again. It Is Most Unfortunate That Such A Beautiful Place   And What Should Have Been Such An Excellent Experience All Round  Should End With Such A Bad Taste. I Feel That The Management Would Do A Lot Better To Set Out The Full Amount Of Each Stay  And Certainly Any Package Deal  At The Outset  So That Intending Clients Can See The Total Cost  And Not Be Ambushed At The End.,,,,,
,4608,The Booklet Of Walks That Started From The Hotel  Were Very Useful. We Enjoyed Doing Several Of Them. We Would Like To Return If The Food Improves.,,,,,
,4609,It Was Good To Meet The Manager And For Him To Be So Visable Throughout Our Stay.,,,,,
,4610,No,,,,,
,4613,I Particularly Did Not Like The Automatic Adding On To Every Invoice Of The 12 And A Half % Service Charge. This Should Be Left To One's Own Discretion. One Feels Compelled To Allow It For Fear Of Appearing Rude. I Did Not Feel For Example  That Charges On Top Of Breakfast Costs Were Necessary  Nor When Having A Single Cup Of Coffee..Whilst I Appreciate Your Comments In The Information Booklet About The Service Charge  I Did Not Feel That This Warranted The Practice Overall.,,,,,
,4615,I Look Forward To Playing Golf Next Time! The Setting Is Superb!,,,,,
,4623,We Stayed In Kitty Jay Lodge Which Was Excellant. The Only Minor Distractions Were The Limited Number Of Red Wine Glasses (3 Of Which 2 Were Chipped)  A Poor Worn Frying Pan  No Ice Cube Maker  The Tv Was Quite Small ( On Which To Watch The Olympic Opening Ceremony) And Seemed To Have Limited Channels (Or Else We Didn't Understand It). However Overall The Rooms And Furnishing Were Of A Very Good Standard  And The Facilities (Ie Pool And Tennis) Were Great.,,,,,
,4624,The Check Out Was A Bit Chaotic. We Left Our Cases In Room As Stated And Checked Out  We Went To Watch Your Magnificent Man With His Birds  Came Back After That To Get Car Keys Thought Our Luggage Would Have Been In Car But Good Job We Looked As It Wasn't  We Had To Go Back To Reception  And Ask Someone To Get It For Us.,,,,,
,4626,I Can't Imagine Why Anyone Would Want To Come Here,,,,,
,4627,I Had Looked Forward To Trying Your Hotel For Many Years  But The Whole Experience Was A Total Let Down.No One In The Hotel Team Knew It Was A Birthday Treat And It Would Have Been A Nice Welcome If A Glass Of Champagne Had Been Offered On Our Arrival ( I Had Thought That Was Why The Girl Who Was To Show Us Around Suggested A Drink To Unwind Before Our Tour) Or Perhaps A Candle In My Chocolate Delice! I Found The Hotel Very Over-Priced And Pretentious.,,,,,
,4630,I Have Never Been So Disappointed In A Hotel Of This Standard Before. I Only Ever Stay In This Standard Of Hotel And I Have To Say Yours Is The Worst Experience I Have Ever Had. Whilst A Stunning Setting And The Downstairs Rooms Glorious That Is Not Enough To Make People Come Back. Also You Need To Get Some Proper Dry Logs For The Fires  The Downstairs Rooms Were So Smokey As To Be Unpleasant. Truly Awful,,,,,
,4632,Sadly This Was A Very Disappointing And Stressful Experience When What We Had Come For Was The Opposite.  I Would No Longer Recommend Bovey Castle As A Place To Stay For Friends And Family  Which Is A Shame Because The Views And The Castle Itself Is Lovely.,,,,,
,4633,We Were Very Happy Indeed With The Provisions Made For My Daughter's Dietary Requirements.,,,,,
,4637,We Were Expecting A Five Star Experience But Would Only Rate It As A Four Star  But At Five Star Prices.  Extremely Expensive For What Was Offered Though The Hotel Is Set In The Most Beautiful Grounds.,,,,,
,4641,Not Sure If My Account Was Accurate  As I Noticed A 20 Pound Refund On My Statement When I Got Home.,,,,,
,4644,The Lounges In Particular Were Delightful And Afternoon Tea Wonderful.  Now I Know How Lovely The Golf Course Is  Next Time I Will Bring My Clubs.  When The Staff Asked  We Informed Them At Breakfast That It Was My Wife's Birthday And A Complimentary Glass Of Champagne Was Produced - A Thoughtful And Very Welcome Gesture.,,,,,
,4646,The Staff Made It Exceptional...I Couldn't Single Out One Person As Thy We're All O Good. The Falconry Was Really Good As Well.,,,,,
,4649,Although The Place Has A Wonderful Atmosphere  I Got The Feeling That It Lacks Either A Bit Of Investment Or Refreshing The Offer.,,,,,
,4651,All Staff Are Very Professional  Friendly And Helpful And Even Though Several People Were Staying We Could Still Find A Quiet Corner To Relax In. We Will Definitely Be Back When We Need To Recharge.,,,,,
,4652,There Needs To Be Clarification And Better Communication Between Secret Escapes And Yourselves As Regards What Is And What Is Not Included For Any Special Offers Advertised. We Did Enjoy The Tennis Court Table Tennis Trampolining Falconry Display And Suggested Walks.... Whilst The Cooked Breakfast Was Well-Presented Also.,,,,,
,4656,Nevertheless A Wonderfull Placevwith Excellent Well Trained And Friendly Staff,,,,,
,4658,When You Next Offer A Travelzoo Deal Also Offer Rooms At A Higher Level Than The Entry Level As We Would Not Go Back To A Classic Room Having Stayed In A Room With A Great View. Equally I Am Not Prepared To Pay The Standard Upgrade Rates,,,,,
,4659,A Return To Bovey Is A Must!,,,,,
,4660,Generally Very Hot. We Slept With Bedroom Windows Wide Open Despite Heavy Rain. Overall (See Above Comments) The Total Cost Of Our Stay (Voucher Plus Extras  Around £360) We Felt Was Not Worth The Cost (And We Have Stayed In Many Hotels Worldwide).,,,,,
,4661,I Feel The Hotel Is Overpriced For What It Offers. It Is Not A Boutique Hotel But Feels More Like A Holiday Resort. We Are Devon Locals And It Was Our First And Will Be Our Last Visit.,,,,,
,4663,The Hotel Being Dog Friendly Is A Great Attraction,,,,,
,4664,Tone Down The Music In The Bar And Restaurant  A Constant Diet Of Frank Sinatra And Dean Martin Became A Little Tiresome After 2 Days,,,,,
,4667,Excellent Location  Beautiful Grounds And Surrounding Walks  But Hotel Lacks Any 'Homely' Feel.,,,,,
,4672,Enjoyed The Falconry Displays. The Walks Guide Is A Really Good Idea.,,,,,
,4674,Maintenance   Sadly The Outdoor Furniture  Is Looking Like In Need Of Urgent Wood Care And Some Of External Doors Near The Falcon Display   We Stayed In May And Thought Then It Wasn't In Keeping With The Standard Expected.  Kettle Is Awkward To Accommodate To The Bedroom Plug Sockets .,,,,,
,4675,This Did Not Stop Me From Loving Bovey   But Would Have Made The Experience Exceptional Rather Than Very Good.,,,,,
,4683,Nothing You Could Have Done Anything About As The Weather Was Generally Very Kind Except For The Heavy Rain From Teatime On The Saturday Which Prevented Or Dissuaded Some Of Our Guests - Particularly The Elderly Or Those Who Didn't Want To Dance - From Crossing Over To The Main Building To Enjoy The Peace And Quiet Of The Various Lounges. You Might Just Think About Some Sort Of Covered Walkway Across From The Function Suite To The Hotel So As To Obviate The Need For Numerous Umbrella Trips On The Part Of Your Ever Helpful Staff. Not Very Much To Complain About Eh?!,,,,,
,4685,No Mobile Reception - Very Bad. There Should Be Free Wifi In All The Hotl General Areas  If Not Throughout The Hotel Including Rooms.,,,,,
,4686,My Only Recommendation Would Be A Better And More Efficient Method At Breakfast Time. Staff Were Walking Around With Food Not Knowing Which Table Required Breakfast. E.G I Was Asked 3 Times If I Had Ordered A Full English Breakfast And In Fact Had Already Eaten.,,,,,
,4687,Front Of House Staff Were Excellent  The Staff In The Oak Bar Were Just Superb.   The Archery And Air Rifle Experience Was Verging On Cheap And Nasty. The Young Man Who Escorted Us Was Superb  Couldnt Do Enough For Us  But The Air Rifle Shooting Was Particularly Poor One Rifle Between 6  The One Rifle Only Had A Front And No Rear Sight  The Pellets Used Were The Cheapest Of The Cheap Making The Experience A Joke. Yes  I Am An Experienced Rifle Shooter And I Know How Little You Would Have To Spend To Make It A Splendid Experience  After All You Do Charge Enough For It.  Would Be Happy To Discuss My Comments With Anyone Who Would Be Interested.,,,,,
,4689,The Lounge With The Big Open Fire Was Far Too Smokey To Use And The Smoke Permeated Throughout The Downstairs Area.  Not A Particularly Healthy Environment For Chest Sufferers To Sit In!,,,,,
,4691,My Stays Are Getting Better - Well Done Team,,,,,
,4692,The Waiting Staff During Meal Times Especially During Our Cream Tea And Breakfast Should Stop Chatting And Give Us A Service.My First Morning At Breakfast I Was Given A Menu And Waited For A Member To Take My Order  Other Friends Came In After Me Got Served With Their With Theirs And I Was Still Waiting For My Order To Be Taken.I Was Not The Only Person Whom Had The Same Problems.Staff Should Have More Training.,,,,,
,4693,12.5% Service Charge For A Bottle Of Wine Brought To Me That I Had To Pour Seemed A Bit Steep And Spoiled An Otherwise Good Experience,,,,,
,4695,Lovely Location.  Excellent Staff.  Enjoyed The Stay.,,,,,
,4696,I Was Surprised To Find A Service Charge When I Purchased Drinks From The Bar Which Were Also Extremely Expensive,,,,,
,4697,We Look Forward To Seeing Frederico And His Staff Again Soon. I Shall Be Bringing My Wife For A Falconry Experience Soon.,,,,,
,4698,No,,,,,
,4699,My 13 Year Old Daughter Loved Bovey Castle And Would Gladly Return.,,,,,
,4700,I Have Sent A Letter Explaining In Detail What I Felt Would Have Made The Experience Better And I Hope The Manager Will Be Replying To The Comments Made.,,,,,
,4702,Although Overall The Building And The Grounds Are Beautiful  We Felt That It Was A Little 'Tired.'  Could Use Some Updating.,,,,,
,4706,While Formal Dining Room Was Below Standard   Bar Staff Was Very Accomodating  Warm And Friendly  They Permitted Us To Eat/Drink To Individual Tase And Demands In Drawing Room,,,,,
,4707,I Strongly Dislike Your Way Of Putting 5% On Package Plus 12% (?) On Restaurant Which Means That You Add On 5+12 On Same Items. As I Didn't Want To Discuss This With Your Staff I Took It. Maybe You Have Difficulties In Getting Staff So Far Out In The Countryside So You Have To Give Them This Extra Tip. The 8Restaurant) Surely Otherwise Wouldn't Have Got It. This Goes Also For Room Attendant. Turn Down Wasn't Done Properly And When Asking For Breakfast Forms We Were Given Breakfast Tea Bags.... English Talking Staff Might Have Been An Idea. The Receptionists Were Most Polite And Professional. The Man  Martin  With His Birds Made Up A Lot For Room/Restaurant Staffs Unprofessionalism And Was Absolutely Worth The Discretionary Service Charge. Having Said This I Like To Say That Some Of The Responsible Restaurant (Manager/Head Waiter?) Staff Were Polite And Nice.,,,,,
,4711,The Noisy Refrigerator & Delinquent Soap Dish In Room 35 Were Disappointing  And Overall We Think That Investment In Some New Carpets Would Not Go Amiss. Otherwise An Excellent Hotel - We Will Certainly Pay A Visit In The Future.,,,,,
,4714,We Had An Excellent Short Break In Relaxing Surroundings  Just What We Wanted. Please Pass On My Thanks To Your Whole Staff.,,,,,
,4715,The Lodges Were Good And We Enjoyed Ourselves.Restaurant Staff Need To Go On A Course Or Have Training.,,,,,
,4716,I Loved Bovey Castle; But I Do Enjoy Good Food/Wine And For Me A Large Part Of The Reason For Staying With Yourselves Was To Enjoy Dining Well As The Day Comes To A Close. That Did Not Happen And For Me That Is A Substantial Black Mark. It Spoiled What Otherwise Would Have Been An Exceptionally Enjoyable Stay.,,,,,
,4717,The Hotel Needs Closer And More Attentive Management.,,,,,
,4718,The Manager Should Take On Board The Comments Made By Guests As This Is A Beautiful Venue And Is Spoiled By Very Poor Standards Especially In Terms Of Custormer Service And Food.,,,,,
,4719,On Departure We Were Not Asked How We Enjoyed Our Stay.  We Did Ask If There Was A Guest Comment Form (Which May Have Been A Hint That We Wanted To Comment On Our Stay) But Were Told That A Survey Would Be Emailed To Us - Hence Our Comments Now.  Breakfast Really Let's The Hotel Down And As It Is The Last Impression Prior To Departure  It Needs Some Attention.,,,,,
,4721,Yes The Whole Place Is Fur Coat And No Knickers.  Get The Basics Right And Then Add The Pretentious Stuff If You Must.,,,,,
,4723,Im Sorry To Have To Say That Our Experience Was Disappointing. In My View Much More Attention To Detail Is Required Especially With Regard To The Room Comfort.,,,,,
,4726,We Did Not Know The Service Charge Was Discretionary. The Hotel Was 5*  The Location Was Wonderful But The Food Was Definitely Not What One Would Expect At Bovey Castle Hotel.,,,,,
,4727,This Was A Wonderfully Relaxing Few Days For My Husband And I After A Very Hectic Summer  And We Will Come Back If The Opportunity Arises.,,,,,
,4728,See You Again!,,,,,
,4729,We Wished We Had Stayed Longer To Be Able To Enjoy The Pool & Spa Area.,,,,,
,4730,Bovey Castle Is A Beautiful Venue And People's Expectations Are Very High. The Staff Looked Smart And Suited The Venue  However  They Come Across A Little False  Probably Trying Too Hard To Be Polite  Too Many Sirs And Madams And Laking Warmth. It's Very Difficult To Get It Right When Dealing With A Wide Variety Of People But This Is 2013 And Most People Enjoy A Little Conversation Rather Than A Cheshire Cat Smile And Eager To Please. There Seemed So Many People Standing To Attention At The Reception Desk  I Guess To Prevent Clients Waiting. At Ease Bovey  You Have A Beautiful Part Of Our English Heritage. Thank You For Our Pleasant And Relaxing Stay.,,,,,
,4732,Sadly We Could Not Have Chosen A Wetter Few Days And Our Intention To Play Your Lovely Golf Course Was Unfortunately Thwarted.,,,,,
,4734,We Were Also Annoyed That The Falconry Display That We Had Been Looking Forward To Watching  And Had Arranged Our Day To Accommodate  Was Cancelled Without Notice  And That We And Other Guests Were Left Standing Around With No Information From Your Staff.,,,,,
,4737,I Travel Extensively For Both Business And Pleasure And Stay In Many Hotels Across The World.  Your Staff Are  In The Main  Very Young And Perhaps Would Benefit From An Older Presence In Both The Bistro And At Breakfast Time In The Dining Room.,,,,,
,4738,We Do Not Feel  The Hotel Represented Good Value For Money.However  We Appreciated The Reduction To Our Bill By The Hotel Manager Due To Our Complaints.,,,,,
,4740,I Would Not Stay With You Again,,,,,
,4743,I Feel That There Are Other Hotels That Offer A Better Experience And Value For Money.  The Stair Carpets In Certain Areas Were Worn Out.,,,,,
,4744,Slight Issue With Final Bill  But Was Quickly Amended  Charged For Bottle Of Champagne We Never Received.,,,,,
,4746,I Spent Five Hours Travelling From Home To The Hotel On The Way We Stopped At A Little Chef Which Was Overall A Better Dining Experience Than In Your Bistro,,,,,
,4747,No,,,,,
,4748,We Have Wanted To Stay At Bovey Castle For A While Now  Having Past It On Many Occasions Visiting My Brother And Family In Princetown  But We Were Extremely Disappointed With The Whole Experience And Will Not Return.,,,,,
,4750,The Stupid Sneaky Penny Add Ons Spoils What Otherwise Would Be Fabulous,,,,,
,4752,No,,,,,
,4755,I Am Beginning To Find The Stays Are Getting Very Expensive - I Very Much Dislike The Added 12.5% Service Charge. The Extras That We Used To Get Are Disappearing. The Magazines Are Very Poor Quality. You Used To Have Car Magazines.,,,,,
,4756,Very Dog Friendly....Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,4757,Thank You For Another Memorable Time.We Will Continue To Recommend.,,,,,
,4759,Overall  A Thoroughly Enjoyable And Relaxing Experience Both When We Come On Our Own Or With The Grandchildren As Provides A Relaxed And Friendly Five Star Experience With Facilities For Everyone.,,,,,
,4762,We Really Appreciated The Falconry Display Despite The Cold Weather.  Although The Hotel Appears Very Formal  The Atmosphere Was Exceptionally Relaxing With A Strong Element Of Fun.,,,,,
,4763,My Thoughts Were That You Are Giving Mixed Messages And Creating A Loss Of Identity For A Manor House/Castle On Arrival To Inside Decor Of New And Old - In Particular The Bistro (Very Modern) And Edwardian Dining  Again New And Old. Again With The Amount Of People There On The Sunday Afternoon. We Would Have Liked To Swim But The Pool Was Full Of Children. Perhaps We Will Get Back During The Week For A Quiet More Relaxing Time. Great Shame As Beautiful Setting And Fabulous Food.,,,,,
,4764,Swimming Pool Was Excellent. Breakfast Selection Was Excellent Enjoyed The Birds Of Prey. Good Choice Of Activities On Offer But Mainly Too Expensive For Us!,,,,,
,4765,We Enjoyed The Falconry Display.,,,,,
,4766,Building And Grounds Were Very Nice And Impressive.  The Wrecked Car At The Entrance Driveway Was An Interesting Touch.  Hotel Staf Seemed Very Capable.,,,,,
,4767,See U All Again,,,,,
,4768,Lovely Hotel  Great Food  Poor Hospitality.,,,,,
,4769,Do You Have A Soap Shortage For The Bathroom?,,,,,
,4771,Had I Realised That The Service Charge Was Discretionary I Would Not Have Paid It For The Falconery Experience Because I Don't See Why The Hotel Needed A Service Charge For This! The Falconrey With Martin Was Excellent And Extremely Interesting.,,,,,
,4774,Sorry To Go On At Q28  As We Really Did Enjoy It  It's Just That Several Small Details Make You Look A Bit Amateur For The Type Of Establishment And The Charge,,,,,
,4775,Wasn't Keen On The Owl Eating A Chick On The Reception Desk,,,,,
,4777,Sign Posting To The Castle Could Have Been Better,,,,,
,4779,Have Had Much Better Experiences Elsewhere. This Was A Celebration For My Husband's Birthday  Not Overall Disappointed As The Venue Is Supberb But Didn't Reach My Expectations,,,,,
,4780,The Fire In One Of The Reception Rooms Was Causing Smoke In The Room Which You Could Smell,,,,,
,4782,We Traveled With Another Couple Who Were Given A Room On The Third Floor.  I Was Unable To View This Room  As I Am Unable To Climb Stairs  But I Understand That Their Room And Bed Was Small And Cramped  And Their 'View'  Over-Looked The Gutters And Roof Of The Next Building.  They Were Charged The Same Price For That Room As We Were For Our Larger  More Open And Accessible Room.  They Were Extremely Disappointed  As Am I  In That I Suggested This Place As A Wonderful Spot To Celebrate My Birthday!  A Mistake Which Will Not Be Repeated!,,,,,
,4783,I Booked This Visit In Spite Of The Very High Room Rates Because I Thought A Stay In A 5 Star Castle Hotel Would Be A Wonderful Experience  And Something That I Couldn't Do In My Home Country  The Usa.  I Think That It Is Misleading To Call This Building A Castle  As It Is In Fact A Country House.  The Rates Charged For Our Rooms Were Not Just Excessive  They Were Exorbitant.,,,,,
,4784,I Did Not Appreciate Being Disturbed In My Room By A Member Of Your Staff Who Wanted To Clean My Room At 8Am Saturday Morning. She Was However Very Polite  Apologising & Said She Would Come Back Later. ,,,,,
,4786,We Will Definitely Come Back For A Longer Visit. Thank You.,,,,,
,4791,Prices Slightly On The High Side.  Our Room Had The Promised View  But For £500 Per Night Plus Service Was On The Small Side.  Bathroom Had No Separate Shower.,,,,,
,4792,Just Disappointed Because Did Not Come Up To Expectations Particularly Our Room. Expected Better For The Rating.  Room Felt Like One For A Groupon Customer Which We Were Not ! It Was A Special Birthday And Not Acknowledged,,,,,
,4793,The Reason I Have Ticked 'Fell Below' To Question 22 Is As Follows.  Four Of Us Stayed With You For The Three Days  Totalling A Spend Of £2 500  Which Is Probably Small By Your Standards.  My Wife Jane Left A Book In The Downstairs Toilets Just Before Departure And Realised Only When We Got Home.  So She Phone The Castle And Asked For It To Be Returned.  My Wife Was Informed That We Would Be Charged For The Return And I See My Credit Card Has Been Debited With £2.46.  I Must Say That If I Had Been On The Phone At The Time I Would Have Invited Bovey Castle To Keep The Book For Its Library  As You Are Obviously In Need Of The Money.  In All Seriousness  This Demonstrates A Total Lack Of Understanding Of The Principles Of Customer Service And Has Soured Our Whole Experience.  A Great Pity!,,,,,
,4794,Great Location And Interesting Building With Attentive Staff But On The Basis Of Our Experience Needs The Bedrooms And Hotwater System Refurbished,,,,,
,4795,A Quality Hotel Is Not The Building Nor Thefacilities.  A Great Hotel Is Made By The People That Work There. Unfortunately At Bovey A Guest Is Not A Guest But A Punter,,,,,
,4796,I Already Completed This On Line Questionnaire Shortly After Our Stay So Surprised To Have It Sent Again Unless The Record Log Or Whatever 'Failed',,,,,
,4797,I Was Pleased It Was Summer As The Windows Did Not Fit In Room 37,,,,,
,4799,The Golf Shop  The Door To The Ladies Changing Rooms Very Stiff And When I Asked For Assistance Was Told To Pull It Hard!! Having Nearly Pulled My Arm Out Of Socket And Was Told After The Golf That If We Wished To Take The Buggy To The Car And Unload Our Clubs  Could That Have Not Have Been Done For Us  Neither Was Ther Any Instruction As To Where The Tees Were Or Course Planners. Lastly As Regards The Water Issue In The Bedroom When We Reported To Reception The Girl Said I Don`T Know How That Could Have Happened  Does Not Take Too Much Working Out Probably Not The Most Appropriate Thing To Say!! A Lovely Place Just Felt A Little Let Down With Attention To Detail,,,,,
,4800,We Stayed In A Lodge And Were Disappointed To See That Rules Were Not Enforced With Regard To Dogs.  A Nearby Lodge Allowed Their Dogs To Roam Freely And Bark At All Hours  Even 5 A.M.  Also Cars Were Not Allowed On The Road To The Lodges But The Same Lodge As The One With The Dogs Parked Their Car Opposite Their Lodge.  If You Are To Have Rules Enforce Them! We Passed These Comments To Your Reception.,,,,,
,4801,It Would Appear That The Need For A Renovation Of Some Of The Rooms Is Fast Approaching.,,,,,
,4802,Four Of Us Were On A Promotion  Vg Value  Very Straigtforward Booking Etc.,,,,,
,4803,Please Get It Right - We Had Decided That Bovey Castle Was To Become Our Regular Escape From Our Busy Lives......When You Get Things Sorted We Will Come Back,,,,,
,4807,Rancid Milk Delivered To The Room Bill Included Items Of Expenditure In The Spa That We Had Not Used Had To Wait For A While For Our Bags To Be Brought Down From The Room,,,,,
,4808,We Would Certainly Return With Our Daughters As We'd All Like To Fly The Birds Of Prey. I Would Like To Have Known About The Pool In Advance - Probably Our Fault For Not Researching/Reading Web Site Properly. On That Point  Your Web Site Is Not Mobile Friendly  That Was A Problem To Us As Much Of Our Research Is Done On The Move. Overall A Great Time Had By All.,,,,,
,4809,I Felt Very Let Down  As I Had Been Led To Believe Bovey Castle Was Something Special And Agreed To Stay The Night As It Was My Friends Wedding On The Saturday And My Partners Birthday On The Sunday And I Thought It Would Be A Nice Treat - How Wrong Could I Be.  Also Regarding The Evening Function  When Will Hotels Like Yours Realise That If You Don't Charge Such Extortionate Prices For Drinks  People Will Actually Drink More  This Certainly Applied To A Party Of Friends Who Were Invited To The Evening Function.  The Grounds Were Quite Nice  But As You Can Only Walk Around Part Because Of The Golf Course  Again It Was Rather Disappointing.,,,,,
,4810,Could Not Check Out Til After Breakfast  Despite Being In A Rush  Only To Discover The Petty Reason Why  As Commented On Previously! Again  I Find The Breakfast Charge Disgraceful On A 2 Day Break  Costing Over £700,,,,,
,4811,The Final Bill Included A Small Erroneous Charge For Food At The Bistro That Was Incurred Prior To Our Arrival.  It Was Not A Large Error But An Error None The Less.  All In All. We Had A Very Nice Stay.,,,,,
,4812,Tennis Court Surface Could Do With A Refurbishment,,,,,
,4816,The Week Passed So Quickly,,,,,
,4817,The Falconry Display Was Enjoyable And The Grounds Are Lovely,,,,,
,4819,Food Greatly Improved Since Last Visit,,,,,
,4830,We'll Be Back!,,,,,
,4832,I Paid The Service Charges But Dont Like Having Them Added To The Bill Regardless Of Service Deleivered.,,,,,
,4833,Falconry Display Was Great.,,,,,
,4838,Our Second Stay At The Hotel Was Not As Good As The First. The Overall Standard Of The Room We Were Allocated Fell Below Expectations. I Purchased The Dinner Bed And Breakfast Package At A Charity Auction (And Probably Paid More Than A Direct Purchase Form The Hotel). I Sincerely Hope That The Room Allocation Was Not Decided On That Factor As The Room Was Inferior To The First Stay Which Was Supposedly In A Less Expensive Room.,,,,,
,4840,This Stay Was For Our Anniversary And I Am Disappointed That It Was Tarnished By These Issues,,,,,
,4841,A Noticeable Improvement In Standards Since Last December.....Well Done To All.  The Bistro Staff Are Friendly And The Food Is Good - But It Feels Wrong.....Too 'Cheap' In Appearance And Is Lacking The Atmosphere And Character That Is Everywhere Else In The Hotel.  It's 'Cheap Cafe' Style.......,,,,,
,4843,No. We Are Looking Forward To My Visit With 14 Guests For My 80Th Birthday On The 4Th 5Th April 14. Perhaps This Warrants A Complimentary Game Of Golf ! .,,,,,
,4844,Some Or The Public Areas Are In Need Of Decoration  Also Cobwebs In The Light Shades Of The Grill Restaurant Were Undesirable  Along With A Tear In The Carpet Of The Bar - Just A Little Tired.,,,,,
,4845,Thanks To All The Staff For A Delightful Two Days At Bovey. We Would Love To Return But Probably In The Summer!,,,,,
,4850,The Reception Owl Was A Lovely Touch,,,,,
,4856,Very Happy Stay,,,,,
,4859,We Will Be Back ! ,,,,,
,4863,The Restaurant Staff Seem A Little Disorganised At Times. As Mentioned Had To Wait Twenty Minutes For Order To Be Taken At Dinner  Had To Go Looking For Someone To Take The Order As All Waiting Staff Disappeared At One Point! At Breakfast Two Of Our Party Had There Breakfast Given To Another Table! Slow To Get Tea And Coffees And Toasts. Nothing That Spoilt The Weekend  But Could Do With Being Addressed. ,,,,,
,4866,Wished We Were Advised How To Avoid Some Of The Narrow Lanes!,,,,,
,4867,Surprised To See The "Discretionary" Service Charge  There Appeared To Be No Option To Cancel That And Make Your Own Arrangements  Bearing In Mind That The Charge Is Taxed And Not All Of It Goes To Those Staff Who Deserve It.,,,,,
,4868,We Really Enjoyed It And So Did Our Guests.,,,,,
,4869,The Discretionary Service Charge We Paid  But Reluctantly. I Would Expect Good Service As Standard At This Type Of Hotel  And At That Tariff.   We Probably Wont Stay Here Again Because Of The Extra Service Charge  On Principle,,,,,
,4875,The Swimming Pool Was Superb And Not Used By Many Of Our Party Group Of 80+ Which Suggests That Not Many Of These Guests Had Realised What A Lovely Pool Bovey Castle Has.,,,,,
,4881,Our Outdoor Activity  Archery And Air Rifling Was Very Good And The Instructor Was Also Very Good And Pleasant.,,,,,
,4883,My Wife And I Enjoyed A Very Comfortable And Relaxing At Bovey Castle,,,,,
,4889,All Good,,,,,
,4893,The Hotel Is Expensive By Uk And Even European Standards  But The Experience Is Unique And The Service Wonderful  Which Justifies It Somewhat.,,,,,
,4895,We Will Return.,,,,,
,4900,Need To Better Itemise Items Of The Final Account  Too Many Code That Mean Nothing Except To Your Staff.,,,,,
,4901,We Shall Return,,,,,
,4905,The Signage To The Spa And The Phone Signal In The Bedrooms Could Be Better,,,,,
,4906,When We Return We Are Going To Spoil Ourselves And Stay In One Of Your State Rooms. More Photos On Your Website Would Help Us Make Our Choice.,,,,,
,4907,Please See Comments Regarding Having To Move Rooms During The Night.,,,,,
,4908,We Had An Agreement That Service Charges Would Not Be Incurred By Any Of Our Guests During Their Stay And I Have Since Found Out That This Was Not The Case. £2.50 Charge On Top Of A Round Of Drinks Is 'Robbery' In My Opinion,,,,,
,4913,Why Not Have More Activities At Bovey Castle Such As Horse Riding Or Clay Pigeon Shooting On Site Rather Than A Long Distance Away? Why Doesn't The Castle Offer Such Activities As Opposed To Having To Drive Some Distance Away To A Place That Does It Independently.,,,,,
,4919,This Was A Treat For Us And Although It Cost Quite A Lot Of Money  It Was Good Value.,,,,,
,4927,Drinks Are Very Expensive Eg £14 For A Bloody Mary,,,,,
,4929,Love To Visit Again. Happily Recommend. Thank You.,,,,,
,4937,No,,,,,
,4939,The Bills In The Bistro And The Restaurant Were Showing A Total. When We Came To Checkout And Check The Final Bill Is Was Split Down By Service Change And Very Difficult To Understand,,,,,
,4940,We Hope To Afford To Return Someday!,,,,,
,4941,As Previous,,,,,
,4942,Just Thank You. ,,,,,
,4946,Service Charge Is High But On The Other Hand The Staff Were Very Good And All Said They Really Enjoyed Working At The Hotel  In Other Words They Are Strongly Motivated. ,,,,,
,4948,Thank You For A Wonderful Holiday.,,,,,
,4949,Would Certainly Return,,,,,
,4955,My Parents Spent Their Honeymoon At Bovey And We Have (Or Had) Great Memories Of Our Own Wedding. We Have Also Dined There Over Hte Past Few Years On A Number Of Occasions But Would Seriously Consider Another Option For Future Stays,,,,,
,4963,I Would Have Liked The Service Charge To Be Explained To Me - We Had A Bill Of Over £50 On Service Charge.,,,,,
,4973,Glasses To See The Code Panels For The Swimming Changing Rooms Was A Nice Touch! ,,,,,
,4975,You Have Not Asked Me About The Quality Of The Meals We Had There. The Food Was Excellent We Thought Except That My Steak Was Rather Tough. At Breakfast The Toast Came Too Early. By The Time I Had Some It Was Soggy And Cold.,,,,,
,4976,The Only Thing I Was Unhappy With Is Your Charge For Phoning Out. As There Is No Mobile Service I Had To Make One Call. To Charge £21 For A Short Call Is Outrageous. For That One Thing  I Will Not Stay With You Again!,,,,,
,4979,The Staff Made It.  We Stay In A Lot Of Lovely Country House Hotels For Work (Lucky Me!) But I Can Honestly Say The Staff At Bovey Castle Were The Friendliest And Most Helpful.,,,,,
,4983,I Ordered A Simple Gin And Tonic And A Bottle Of Jail Ale. £17.50. Come On I Know Its A Plush Place To Stay But I Really Think Your Drink Prices Are Extreme. The Most Expensive Drinks I Have Ever Bought Anywhere In The World. Even More Expensive Than Our Capital City. Its All About The Profit At The Bar And This Is Why I Think A Lot Of People Bring Their Own Drink. Extorshonate Prices. We Are Not All Rich,,,,,
,4991,We Look Forward To Coming Back!  Thank You,,,,,
,4994,Excellent Location And Property   Personally I Feel That The Charging Structure For Drinks Is Wrong If Costs Were  More Inline With Other Hotels  I Know This Would Benefit The Business.,,,,,
,4996,Lauren Was Excellent; Indeed All Of The Staff Were Superb. We Liked The Ferret And Egg Collecting; These Touches Really Enhance Our Enjoyment. ,,,,,
,4997,Public Rooms Were Beautiful  Fantastic Tall Christmas Tree  Amazing To Find Owl Display Inside The Hotel Due To Rain  Not Sure About Budgie In Reception!  Very Relaxed Atmosphere Due To Staff Friendliness And Helpfulness.  We Had A Good Room For Access With Dog Without Going Through Reception Although The Person Who Showed Us The Room Said That There Was No Other Access Than Through Reception.  Great Idea To Have Dog Towels At The Main Entrance.  Extremely Comfortable Bed And Pillows.  Extremely Quiet At Night And Early Morning,,,,,
,4999,With Regard To Checking Whether Final Account Was Accurate  This Would Be Easier If Itemised Copy Receipts Were Given To You At Time Of Ordering Food And Drink  As Is Done In Many Hotels Abroad And On Cruise Ships  Which One Would Then Be Able To Compare Against Final Account,,,,,
,5009,Can't Wait For Our Next Visit And For My Family To Come Too!,,,,,
,5015,Final Bill Lumps All Food Together Rather Than Separating Dinner Plus Wine And Afternoon Teas- A Little Confusing To Us And Staff!,,,,,
,5016,I Look Forward To Staying Again. The Bovey Castle Team Are Great!,,,,,
,5017,Found Rather Odd Having A Parrot In The Living Room (Especially Flying!) And  The Lovely Wooden Panels In One The Big Living Rooms Spied By Glass Shelves For Books. ,,,,,
,5018,We Did Notice That Bovey Castle Is Run Rather Like A Cruise Ship  But Not A Top Quality One.  I Expected More People To Be Around In The Evenings  So That We Had Someone To Talk To.  So We Went To Our Room.  It Was Difficult To Find The Channels On The Tv.  There Was No Channel 5.  Nowhere Was There Instructions On How To Change The Channels Or Even Which Ones Where There.  We Were Told That All The Freeview Channels Were There  But The Numbers We Regularly Use Where Not.  So We Just Ended Up With 1 2 3 4.  Also A Map Of The Castle And Grounds  Would Be Interesting.   It Was Only On The Last Day That We Found That There Was Something On The Back Of The Paper With The Weather Forecast On It!  On The First Night We Had A Piece Of Fudge Never Again  2 Days Biscuits But Not On The 3Rd.  All Very Hit And Miss!   Sometimes Extra Milk  Sometimes Not.,,,,,
,5021,May Not Have Paid The Discretionary Service Charge For My Drinks Bill If I Had Realised ,,,,,
,5022,We Are Aghast At The Lack Of Management Concern In An Establishment Of This Calibre.,,,,,
,5024,Not Really...,,,,,
,5025,Thank You For Making Our Wedding Day A Day To Remember ,,,,,
,5026,Sad That The Christmas Package Was Sold Out But In All Honestly I Think It Included A Lot More Food Than We Could Have Consumed So Maybe All For The Better But Maybe Good To Have A Lighter Option Or Tone Down The Quantity Of Food A Bit!  ,,,,,
,5036,Overall A Very Nice Experience!,,,,,
,5039,Wonderful Experience. Love Bovey Castle And The Team. Will Definitely Recommend. ,,,,,
,5040,See Comments Above,,,,,
,5044,Overall First Class  The Whole Hotel Was Warm   Friendly And Felt Homely And Comfortable .Staff Were Attentive With Out Being Overbearing. It Was Delightful To Have Such A Choice Of Pleasant Places To Sit By Open Fires In Comfy Beautiful Surroundings. The Room Decorations And Xmas Trees Were Stunning. Well Done We Will Be Back !,,,,,
,5049,We'll Be Back :-),,,,,
,5052,We Will Return.,,,,,
,5053,Having Got Married At Bovey And Eaten In Both Restaurants On Several Occasions Since There Was Much Anticipation That The Break Would Be Great. In All Respects   Other Than The Meal On Xmas Day   It Lived Up To Expectations.,,,,,
,5055,We Did Find The Building Excessively Hot And Took A While To Make The Necessary Dress Adjustments  And In Time Were Frequent Visitors To The Cooler Spots; Seats Near Windows And Doors!  You Produced A Wonderful Festive Programme For Us For Which We Are Most Grateful.,,,,,
,5057,Ian - The Shooting Coach - Is Excellent And We Had A Lot Of Fun With Him. Thank You. ,,,,,
,5060,We Were Happy To Pay The Service Charge (As The Service Was Great).  However As We Were Checking Out Other Guest Were Going Through Their Charges And Were Obviously Not Happy.  I Would Imagine This Happens On A Regular Basis As The Layout Of The Service Charges Is Complicated.  I'm Sure The System You Have In Place Leaves Some Guests With A Sour Taste In Their Mouths As They Leave As Well As Being Uncomfortable For The Reception Staff.  A Package Is A Package After All And People Take Them As They Know How Much It Will Cost And Are Of Course Shocked At The Extra Charges.    Nobody Likes To See People Complaining About Their Bill As They Are Checking Out Of A Hotel.,,,,,
,5062,We Hope To Return Next Year!,,,,,
,5069,Frederico Does Not Appreciate Our  Loyalty.  My Family Is So Welcomed In Other Hotels  And They Know The  Names And Ages Of My Children.  Federico Does Not Know Our Names And We Stayed In Your Hotel At Least 20 Times Over The Last Decade!  When I Booked  I Was Told We Were Getting A Complimentary Bottle Of Champagne Upon Arrival  And It Never Arrived.  We Never Had A Welcome Gift From Your Hotel  Yet Every Other Hotel We Stay In Seem To Send Fruit  Cookies For The Children  Etc.. So Much For Loyalty!,,,,,
,5073,I Told The Reception Of The Door Key Not Working On The Friday Evening As We Had A Drink  Supposedly The Door Was Checked.. It Did Not Open We Had To Use The Bedroom Access   Our Daughter Slipped And Fell Badly On The Decking... This Ruined The Evening. ,,,,,
,5074,Having Said That The Staff Were As Helpful As Possible Once We Refused To Be Sat In The Corner Of The Bistro For A Second Time And We Were Finally Found Somewhere To Sit.,,,,,
,5076,We'll Be Back In May ,,,,,
,5078,Two Weeks Over Christmas 2014 Already Booked.,,,,,
,5079,Thank You For A Lovely Break!,,,,,
,5080,Exceptional Manager With Amazing Energy   Made All The Difference To The Stay  Food Poor But Service Fine   Lodges Great But Along With The Pool  Changing Rooms Etc All In Need Of New Investment To Keep Up With The Likes Of Chewton Glen As A Top Class Location,,,,,
,5083,We Will Definitely Return And Having Stayed In The Lodges Previously (Which Are Very Comfortable) We Are Converted To The Hotel Rooms! An Incredibly Cosy Place To Stay.,,,,,
,5086,Slightly Disappointed That All Seating Areas Were Reserved After The New Years Eve Meal.  We Were Hoping To Watch The Fireworks At Midnight But After Vacating The Restaurant At 11Am Found That There Was Nowhere To Sit For An Hour And Ended Up Going Back To The Lodge.,,,,,
,5090,We Had Some Charges On Our Bill Which We Felt Were Unacceptable. £15 In Telephone Charges Was Too Expensive For Six Phone Calls Which Were No More Than A Couple Of Minutes  Particularly When We Had No Choice As There Was No Mobile Reception. We Were Not Aware Of The Charges Until We Were Presented With The Bill. We Were Also Charged A Breakfast Supplement But It Is Not Clear What That Was For. Unfortunately We Were In A Hurry To Leave So Didn't Have Time To Question This. Had We Known How Many Steps There Were To Get To Parts Of The Castle  We Would Have Requested A Room That Was Easier To Get To With A Pushchair  With No Stairs. We Did Mention That There Would Be A Baby With Us So Not Sure If This Was Taken In To Account.,,,,,
,5095,All Comments As Mentioned Earlier In This Survey.,,,,,
,5098,We Cannot Praise The Experience Enough - Truly Outstanding On All Fronts...............A Totally Relaxing Experience Where Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. ,,,,,
,5104,No,,,,,
,5105,Carry On As You Do Now Please - We Love It !!,,,,,
,5106,Merlin The Owl Was A Wonderful Character.  All Staff At Bovey Castle Deserve A Mention As They Kept Smiling All Through The New Year Celebrations When I Am Sure They Must Have Been Very Tired  So Hats Off To Them.,,,,,
,5108,Having Got Married At Bovey Castle In 2010 This Was The Second Time We've Come Back - And This Time Was Better Than When We Stayed In 2011.  This December's Visit More Relaxed  The Service Was Back Up To The Standards We Saw In 2010 And The Christmas Decorations Were Beautiful.  We'll Be Back Again!  Thank You For A Very Enjoyable Stay.,,,,,
,5112,Having Stayed On Two Previous Occasions Where We Booked Direct We Were A Bit Sceptical About What We Would Find. The Only Thing We Didn't Get I Think Was Daily Housekeeping. We Were Completely Bowled Over By Jaystone. My Youngest Cried When We Left - We Will Be Regulars Now As Long As The Value For Money Exists! Thanks To All.,,,,,
,5115,Thank You Jeremy Federico And All The Team An Excellent Stay For Us .. Wonderful  11 Out If 10 Will Be Back With Other Szymkowicz S And Harpers In Tow,,,,,
,5117,Thank You To The Whole Team For A Lovely Stay!,,,,,
,5119,Some Upgrading Needed On Furnishings  Particularly The Stair Carpets.,,,,,
,5120,I Would Appreciate An Email Back  Having Read My Submission.,,,,,
,5123,The Whole Package Was Really Superb  The Firework Display At Midnight Spectacular. It Would Be Nice If There Was A Way Of Linking The Official Countdown To New Year To The Loudspeaker System.,,,,,
,5124,The Girl That Did The Ferrets And Chickens On Sunday Showed No Enthusiasm And Clearly Didn't Want To Be There. This Was A Shame As It Is A Real Highlight For The Kids,,,,,
,5126,No.,,,,,
,5129,Thought It Sad That When The Pianist Was Playing On Friday Night  The Piped Music Was Not Turned Off. The Result Was A Confusion Of Music And Undermined The Talent Of The Pianist. ,,,,,
,5133,Did I Not Need To Pay Discretionary Service Charge? I Would Not Have Done For The Room If I Had Known Correctly :( ,,,,,
,5134,Thanks For Everything  We Are Very Happy And Will Come Back Some Day.,,,,,
,5140,Welcome Drink   Just A Drop Of Something Would Be Nice  Like They Do In Skibo,,,,,
,5141,The Place Is Stunning And I Would Love To Stay Again. Enjoyed Every Bit.,,,,,
,5148,Would Welcome Any Offers You Run In Future As I Would Love A Girlie Weekend Too,,,,,
,5150,We Will Definitely Return In The Future As The Overall Experience Was Super.,,,,,
,5151,Well Done Federico - You Are Doing A Grand Job!,,,,,
,5154,Keep Up The Good Work Congratulations,,,,,
,5158,We Really Want To Thank Everyone At Bovey For Making Our Stay Memorable And Going The Extra Mile To Commodate Our Special Needs. We Always Have A Special Place In Our Hearts For Bovey And Your Hospitality Really Made Our Trip. ,,,,,
,5162,We Were A Little Surprised To See A 5% Service Charge On Absolutley Everything Including The Spa  Coffe  Tea  Dinner  Bar Drinks Etc Etc.  May We Ask If This Is Given Directly To The Staff?,,,,,
,5166,The Complimentary Nuts  Satsumas And Sweets Etc Was A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,5167,A Personal Thank You To Mr Aresti For Dealing With Our Original Issues In Such A Professional And Efficient Way This Stay Was A Very Positive And Enjoyable Experience . Very Much Appreciated.Thank You To All Of The Team. Hope To Visit Again In The Future.,,,,,
,5168,Apart From The Above  Which Were Little Niggles We Had A Lovely Time And I'm Sure We Will Return Another Year.,,,,,
,5169,I'm Happy For You To Publish The Results  And Am Also Happy For You To Leave Out The Comments Regarding Our Meal As I Know You Will Do Your Utmost To Put This Right  And I Wouldn't Want To It Anyone Off From Staying With You,,,,,
,5171,Due To The Number Of Guests On The Last Day Room Service Forgot Our Complementary Wine And Also On That Day Room Service Slipped From The High Standard Of Previous Days.,,,,,
,5175,The Hotel Is Lovely And The Staff Are Great  It Is Just Looking A Little Tired. The Linen Press Wardrobe Was Lovely But Missing Some Trim And Too Short To Hang Dresses And Coats In And There Were No Hooks In The Room For Anything Longer. ,,,,,
,5176,Was A Little Concerned Prior To Stay About Some Of Negative Comments On Trip Advisor  However We Were Totally Satisfied  Thank You,,,,,
,5178,We Had Full Afternoon Tea Which Was The Best I Have Ever Had. Just One Really Small Point Tongs For The Sugar Would Have Been Nice Sorry It Is Just A Small Point.,,,,,
,5180,For All My Constructive Comments .....Great Place...Looking Forward To Visiting Again... Love The Uniforms...Think About Selling The Socks  Ties  Waist Coats... There's A Line There Somewhere..  Regards Geraldine.Benson@Me.Com,,,,,
,5188,We Will Definitely Revisit Bovey Castle. The Staff Were Fantastic From The Manager   Who Was Visibly In Attendance   Down.,,,,,
,5191,Felt That The Price Of Dining Was Excessive As The Food Was Not Exceptional.,,,,,
,5195,Service Charge Added Onto Everything Was A Bit Much  I Know It Was Discretionary But Would Have Been Difficult To Have Taken Bits Off From The Final Bill.,,,,,
,5197,Had A Really Lovely Break  Not Been To The Hotel For Approx 14 Years And Thoroughly Enjoyed It.  It Was A Surprise Christmas Present.  All The Staff Were Friendly  Attentive And The Atmosphere In The Hotel Is Very Relaxed.  Would Love To Go Back Very Soon And Take My Husband And Dog  Most Impressed That Dogs Are Very Welcome!,,,,,
,5198,Thankyou Can't Wait To Come Again ,,,,,
,5205,Keep Up The Great Work - I'd Love To Come Back Again And Have Already Recommended To A Number Of Friends. ,,,,,
,5207,We Approved Of The Way The Service Charge Was Made - And Explained. We Enjoyed Our Brief Stay Very Much And Will Hope To Return Though May Have To Wait For Another Offer Before We Can Do So.,,,,,
,5208,Can't Wait To Save Up And Visit Again. ,,,,,
,5209,We Have Visited Many Times But Never Tiring Of Returning. It Is The Highlight Of Our Year And Hope Shall Remain So. Thanks.,,,,,
,5211,Thank You For Taking The Time To Phone Listen To My Concerns And Investigate Further. I Look Forward To Speaking With You Again.,,,,,
,5212,It Was A Shame That The Weather Was So Foul During Our Stay. However  The Provision Of Wellingtons By The Hotel Came In Very Useful  And We Were Thereby Able To Go For A Long Walk. The Booklets Provided Were Very Good  And Easy To Follow,,,,,
,5214,We Did Not Realise The Service Charge Was Discretionary. Plus In Retrospect I Think We Were Double Charged The Service Charge As Well. The Bill Was Not Clear So This Was Hard To Detect At The Time.,,,,,
,5219,No,,,,,
,5221,I Loved The Welcome Drinks 'Hamper' And Cava. It's Just A Pity The Water Wasn't Warm In The Evening. Also The Heating Was A Bit Overpowering The Next Day We Felt.,,,,,
,5223,Its A Wonderful Venue.  I Loved Sitting Around In The Evening In The Various Downstairs Rooms.,,,,,
,5224,We Plan To Come Back  And We Live Fairly Locally - One Night Just Wasn't Enough.,,,,,
,5225,The Staff  The Service And The Quality Of The Food In Both The Edwardian Grill & The Bistro Just Gets Better Each Time We Stay,,,,,
,5232,My Only Complaint Was When We Checked Out We Had To Wait Whilst Receptionist Had A Long Conversation On The Telephone  Which Did Not Appear To Be Completely Necessary.,,,,,
,5235,We Had A Faultless Break And Felt Like We Had Escaped From Our Everyday Lives For Longer Than Just One Night. Thank You For Making My Husbands 40Th Birthday Treat A Magical And Memorable Experience.,,,,,
,5236,No.,,,,,
,5242,Rita In The Spa Was Very Good,,,,,
,5243,Not As Good As My Previous Stay  A Few Fundamental Things Went Wrong  1. Checked Into Incorrect Room - Had To Wait 90 Mins Then Move 2. Bill Was Incorrect After Lunch On The First Day 3. Steak Was Not Cooked To How I Requested  Regards  Alan  07961 005 946,,,,,
,5245,Congratulations To Everyone On A Well Run And Lovely Hotel,,,,,
,5249,I Look Forward To Visiting Again!,,,,,
,5253,I Will Send U A Mail Separetly ... In A Hurry Now ,,,,,
,5257,I Would Normally Sleep With A Window Open But None Of Mine Opened Which With The Air Conditioning On Just Made A Little Bit Close But Again Due To The Age And Charm Of The Building  I Understand. ,,,,,
,5266,We Will Come Again One Day.,,,,,
,5267,We Felt A Little On Show At Breakfast Being The Only Diners In The Edwardian Grill Restaurant-The Quiet Calm Grandeur Of The Room Works Well At Night But The Silence Of Being Outnumbered By Staff(Albeit Polite Staff)Made For A Speedy Breakfast.,,,,,
,5269,We Will Return Soon And Love The Hotel. Better Country Atmosphere And More Relaxing Than Gidleigh Park!,,,,,
,5279,Another Lovely Experience   Thank You,,,,,
,5281,I Had A Really Wonderful Time.  My Guests Have Very High Expectations And Again I Apologise For Any Rude-Ness You Encountered.  However  Everyone Enjoyed Their Stay Overall And Would Come Back Again.  A Special Thanks To Dani Who Helped Me Organise The Whole Event And Was Very Flexible Throughout.  There Were A Few Hiccups And Communications Misses  But Overall Great.
Thank You!,,,,,
,5282,Needs Better Signposting. ,,,,,
,5284,I Did Not Feel That A Service Charge Of £20 On The Cost Of The Accommodation That We Had Pre Paid Was Appropriate. The Bill Was Very Confusing As There Had Apparently Been A Problem With The Computers The Previous Day! I Could Not Match Items With What We Had Booked  So It Was Difficult To Know If It Was Accurate.,,,,,
,5287,Yes Ashley Who Looked After Us Was Very Attentive ,,,,,
,5288,Overall It Was Really Excellent. The Service Charge Was A Good Idea Because It Meant There Was No Ambiguity About Tipping. The Food And Drink Were Superb  The Whole Experience Was Great. ,,,,,
,5289,You Are More An Average 4 Star  Wouldn't Relish What It Might Be Like When You Are Busy. 
Your Staff / Colleagues Need To Smarten Up On Their Customer Service & For Some Their English Language Skills

,,,,,
,5290,Booking Wedding As A Result Of Great Service.,,,,,
,5296,Will Definately Try To Visit Again ,,,,,
,5297,Bovey Castle Is A Beautiful Place To Stay.,,,,,
,5301,Keep On Travelzoo,,,,,
,5303,We Will Be Writing An Entry On Trip Advisor Extolling Bovey Castle And The Staff.,,,,,
,5305,Fredrico Was Extremely Kind To Us And Made Us Feel Very Welcome.,,,,,
,5306,Wonderful Stay  Will Recommend.,,,,,
,5307,The Bovey Castle Website Isn't A Good User Experience - It's Not Logically Laid Out And I'm Not Sure You Guys Market The Key Aspects Of Bovey Castle - A Website Is A Hotels Window To The World - You Really Need To Look At Your Competition And Market Yourselves Better. You Have A Gem In Dartmoor And I Hope Who Ever Purchases You Will Invest In The Hotel And The Marketing Of The Place.,,,,,
,5319,You Are Kidding!!!!,,,,,
,5320,I Believe That You Should Be Able To Suggest A Discretionary Charge As Opposed To Just Adding It On!!,,,,,
,5322,Overall I Really Enjoyed My Stay ,,,,,
,5323,Liked The Activities On Offer 
Grounds And Walks Were Beautiful
Young Guy On The Door Very Friendly And Welcoming
Had Two Sets Of Friends Both Very Jealous We Were Coming To Bovey Who Said It Was On There List Of Places They'd Love To Go - Feel Its A Shame I Won't Be Raving To Them About Experience Which Is A Missed Opportunity
,,,,,
,5325,Hope To Return.,,,,,
,5327,The Gym Was A Huge Disapointment - Looks Like Someone Has Been To Lots Of Car Boots Or Argos And Kitted It Out - No Excuse In This Day And Age - Contact Me If You Want A Consultant To Kit It Out - You Could Get This Room To Pay - A Freelance Trainer Who Pays You And Another Service To Offer - You Need To Address This. The Pool Was Also Showing Signs Of Wear And Tear - Mirror Off The Wall By The Steam - Also Need Times When No Kids Are Allowed In - On Saturday The 1St Feb It Was Like Being At The Local Council Pool Not An Upmarket Spa - Also Why No Drinks Service By The Pool - This Could Be Another Revenue Stream And Offer A Service ,,,,,
,5328,Well Done  Thank You To All Of You And We Will See You Very Soon On Our Return Visit. First Class - And That Was Including A Lodge Move! 

(The Bovey Walking Booklet Was Brilliant Too. Accurate Well Thought Out And A Brilliant Mix Of Long And Short Walks!),,,,,
,5329,No,,,,,
,5330,Whilst It Did Not Spoil The Experience I Still Feel Wine And Bar Overpriced.,,,,,
,5334,We Will Be Back,,,,,
,5336,Overall Lovely Stay  Falconry Display Was A Great Extra Surprise,,,,,
,5337,I Didn't Receive A Final Statement On Departure? ,,,,,
,5338,Thank You.,,,,,
,5339,I Would Just Like To Thank You All For Making My Wife's Birthday So Special. Hope To See You All Again Soon.,,,,,
,5342,Thank You To Everyone. I Hope To See You Very Soon.,,,,,
,5344,No.,,,,,
,5347,My Wife Would Have Used Your Spa Facility But Not Bookings Were Available During Our Short Stay. Perhaps When A Hotel Booking Is Made That A Message Or Email Could Be Sent Suggesting Booking The Spa In Advance Of Arrival.,,,,,
,5350,Only That On Arrival On The Saturday (The Weather Was Awful) Every Seating Area Had Been Reserved However In The Main Was Not Being Used.  There Were Quite A Few New Arrivals  Such As Ourselves Wondering Around The Hotel Trying To Find Somewhere To Sit And Have A Drink.  We Ended Up Having To Go Back To Our Room.  Had These Been Operated On A First Come First Served Basis  The Hotel I Am Sure Would Have Benefitted From Additional Revenue As They Would Have Been Used At Least Twice Given The Weather  And The Arriving Customers Would Probably Have Felt More Welcome - It Was Such A Shame After Such A Fantastic Welcome In The Car Park And At Reception.   Hope This Helps,,,,,
,5352,No,,,,,
,5357,Will Have To Come Back Again,,,,,
,5358,It Was Such A Joy To Experience The Hospitalityand Great Service Of Your Staff And The Slendour Of The Castle Is Awesome.,,,,,
,5361,A Caution The Breakfast Was Not "Hot" I Think The Bain Marie's We're Not Holding This To Temp. 
The Evening Bar Experience On This Visit Was Not As Attentive As I Felt It Normally Was. ,,,,,
,5363,Thank You,,,,,
,5365,Given That One Cannot Use One's Mobile Phone The Landline Charges Should Be Looked At.  I Was Charged £3.00 To Make A Minute Call Home To London.,,,,,
,5367,Concierge Could Not Access Cloakroom For Bags  Then When Asked To Help Move A Car So We Could Leave He Said He Would Get Some Help But Disappeared! Later Found Someone Else To Help Who Was Great!,,,,,
,5369,Lovely Walk To The Village Of North Bovey And Across Grounds. ,,,,,
,5371,No,,,,,
,5373,It Was Worth Every Penny!!!!,,,,,
,5374,Excellent Stay Other Than The Evening Meal.,,,,,
,5376,We Loved It   Thank You Very Much ,,,,,
,5378,The Castle And The Grounds Were Beautiful And The Service Was Impeccable. We Travelled A Long Way To Get There And The Journey Was Absolutely Worth It. We Will Undoubtedly Be Coming Back Again.,,,,,
,5382,Thanks To Everyone Especially Frederico. ,,,,,
,5383,The Road From Moretonhampstead Was Quite Hard To Find..Could You Put Up Some Signs? ,,,,,
,5385,Need To Fit New Carpets On The Stairs Down To Room 37
Need To Stop Leaks In The Roof And Windows,,,,,
,5386,Should Be Left To The Completion Discretion Of The Customers As To Whether Or Not To Tip - Not Add On And Put Onus On The Customer To Have Removed.,,,,,
,5387,The Men Played Snooker Instead Of Playing Golf  It Would Have Been Great If The Snooker Table Had Been In One Of The Grand Rooms With A More Opulent Atmosphere.  It Could Be A Great Feature But Was A Bit Lost In The Basement.,,,,,
,5388,Particularly Enjoyed The Birds Of Prey And Meeting The Ferrets. The Facilities For Children Were Very Good And Unusually Discreet For A Hotel.,,,,,
,5392,None,,,,,
,5393,Enjoyed The Swimming Pool And Facilities,,,,,
,5396,Martin ( Falconry ) Is Still Fantastic  Ironically He Did Remember Us.
Federico As A Manager You Are To Be Commended  Always Around And Interested In The Guests  I Wish Your Staff Would Follow Suit.,,,,,
,5399,Our Stay Was Short Due To A Hospital Appointment On The Day We Were Travelling To Bovey Castle Which Delayed Our Departure.  Gales And Rising Flood Water Meant That We Left  On The Following Day  Earlier Than We Intended.  During The 24 Hours That We Were With You  So Much Was Packed In And We Felt Pampered And Relaxed.  I Think Our "Mini" Break Did Us More Good Than A Fortnight's Holiday!,,,,,
,5402,I Think It Is A Special Place But Overnight Stay Was Poor Value As Meal Was More Cafe Than Evening Dining Experience Expected And Experienced At Other Places.,,,,,
,5404,All In All A Very Well Presented Leisure Hotel With Facilities - Well Done.
Fallconer Was Particularly Engaging And This Is A Very Nice And Rare Touch.
,,,,,
,5405,Thanks To All Who Made Are Stay So Enjoyable.,,,,,
,5406,Thank You For An Amazing Stay. We Booked Last Minute (The Day Before We Came) Having Not Been Able To Afford The Advertised Prices. We Felt Well And Truly Spoilt  And Very Thankful That You Accepted Our Booking. We Will Not Brag About The Discount You Gave Us  But It Did Mean That We  And The Children We Able To Enjoy Such A Dream Holiday Unexpectedly And Return To A Place We Stayed Before Out Of Holiday Time. We Are Truly Thankful For This. You Have An Amazing Hotel. Please Let Us Know If You Need Us To Write A Favourable Review At Any Time About Dog Friendly / Child Friendly Venues. You Deserve To Do Well. ,,,,,
,5410,Whereas I Was Quite Happy To Pay The 'Discretionary' Service Charge - Both In The Restaurant And Finally - I Would Have Preferred To Be Asked  Rather Than To See It On The Bills Without Prior Reference Or Consent.,,,,,
,5413,Just A Genuine Thank You For Making Us Feel So Comfortable And Welcome ,,,,,
,5414,Access To Kitty Jay For Unloading/Loading Is Not Good.
Minor Maintenance Issues - Toaster  Heating And Radio. The First Two Were Speedily Corrected When Reported.,,,,,
,5415,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,
,5416,The Manager Was Extremely Friendly  And Also Offered Us A Complimentary Glass Of Champagne,,,,,
,5417,No - Just Keep Up The Excellent Service Levels. Also Good To Notice The Higher Level Of People Around To Assist When Needed - Greatly Appreciated. Also Fantastic Dog Facilities In The Entrance Hall With Towells & Boots For Walking.,,,,,
,5423,We Had A Pleasant Break In A Stunning Location And Lovely Service From Your Happy Team.,,,,,
,5426,Thankyou For A Lovely Stay It Was A Special Overnight Stay For My Partners Birthday And She Has Already Asked When We Can Go Back For A Longer Stay Next Time,,,,,
,5430,Thank You  We Will Be Back.,,,,,
,5433,We Were Very Happy With Our Stay And Are Now Planning To Have Our Wedding At The Bovey Castle Next Year.,,,,,
,,,,,,,
31,It Is Very Important To Us To Minimise Our Impact On The Environment. Do You Have Any Ideas Or Changes We Could Make So That We Can Be Greener As A Business?,,,,,,

,3,Room Cards To Activate And Deactivate The Electric In Each Room Perhaps  But In Many Ways The Key Feature Is Part And Parcel Of The Tradition You Feel At Bovey So That Kind Of Addition May Take Some Charm Away,,,,,

,29,No,,,,,
,34,Unfortunately I Cannot Think Of Any.,,,,,
,50,No,,,,,
,58,Being An Safety  Environmental And Public Heath Officer Of A Large Cruise Line  I Will Forward Some Ideas In A Separate Email,,,,,
,61,I Too Care About The Environment  But Gimmicky Hotel Programs Don't Impress.  Please Don't Overdo It.,,,,,
,63,Provide Activity List Via Tv Link To Rooms And Lodges. Wi Fi Should Also Be As A Courtesy Especially In Lodges.,,,,,
,64,Why Not Grow Your Own Fruit (Especially Soft Fruit) And Vegetables? It Could Even Be Interesting For Guests To Visit/Buy To Take Home,,,,,
,67,If Any Thing The Heating In The Bedrooms Was Too Much  We Could Not Find Any Simple Way To Turn It Down,,,,,
,70,1. Put A Bin In The Lodge For Cans Etc  2. Led Downlights In Lodge They Last Longer And Reduce Energy Usage Capital Cost Has Dropped (A Lot Of Haytor Down Lights Were Not Working 3. Change Heating Boilers To Biomass Boilers When They Need Replacing  Grants May Be Available 4. External Ground Night Floodlights  Drive Etc Look At Led,,,,,
,73,I Thought You Did Pretty Well In This Respect Actually.....When You Pay For Luxury  You Expect Luxury So Sometimes You Do Want The Extra Toiletries Or Extra Towels Etc Etc....Fires Were Lovely....Maybe More Eco Friendly Fuels Could Be Used...Wood From The Estate Etc Etc,,,,,
,78,Heating In The Lodge Was Far Too High And We Had Trouble Controlling It.,,,,,
,81,A Card-Slot In The Room To Get The Lights To Turn On. Actually Leaving Towels To Be Used Again When Guests Leave Them Hung Up.,,,,,
,87,Nothing Immediately Comes To Mind. Throughout The Us Many Hotels (Even Many Luxury Ones) Post Signs In Rooms Advising Guests That In Order To Minimize Use Of Washing Equipment  Guests Should Leave Towels On The Floor To Replace Them Or Hang Them Up If They Want To Re-Use Them The Next Day. That Cuts Down On Unnecessary Energy Use And Detergent Discharge.,,,,,
,88,We Did Sort Out Our Rubbish To Be Recycled I.E. Cardboard  Plastic Glass Etc But There Was No Literature On Where We Should Dispose Of It.,,,,,
,89,Why? It Would Cost The Earth To Make The Place Truly 'Green' .,,,,,
,90,No,,,,,
,92,Notices Regarding Re-Use Of Towels If They Are Hung Up  Rather Than Left On Floor In The Room.  ,,,,,
,93,Re-Use Water For Irrigation. Consider Solar Panels / Geothermal,,,,,
,97,Getting Better Reception For Mobile Phones/Internet/Fax,,,,,
,100,No  I Think You Should Look After Your Old Customers A Bit More.,,,,,
,104,The Room Was Quite Hot So It Might Be A Good Idea To Provide Some Instructions About How To Control The Heat In The Rooms. You Could Also Give The Guests The Option Of Not Having Bed Linen Changed Daily. I Liked The Fact That The Drinking And Bathing Water Was Taken From The River. I'm Not Aware Of What The Environmental Policy Of The Golf Course Is Like But That Could Be Another Area (Irrigation  Use Of Pesticides/Herbicides). Overall  I Think The Hotel Shows A Good Commitment To The Environment  Which Is Extremely Important Given Its Location In A National Park.,,,,,
,107,None.,,,,,
,114,Nothing Comes To Mind,,,,,
,117,Provide An Internal Recycling Bin For Glass And Paper In The Lodges. We Weren't Sure What To Do With Ours.,,,,,
,119,Have You Changed All Your Light Fiitings To Gu10 Led Etc Etc,,,,,
,121,No,,,,,
,129,Install Either Air Source Or Ground Source Heat Pumps.....,,,,,
,135,More Drying Space For Towels So They Can Be Used  Special Bins For Recycing Papers,,,,,
,139,Ensure Shower In Room 1 Is Not Allowed To Flood The Wet.,,,,,
,142,Temperature Inside Was  In Many Areas  Higher Than Necessary.  Several Guests  Including Us  Had Very Dry Throats After A Night With You.,,,,,
,144,No,,,,,
,147,Arrange Transportation To The Castle From The Closest Train Station,,,,,
,155,I Think It Is Not Necessary To Change The Towels Two Times A Day.,,,,,
,156,No,,,,,
,157,Make Use Of The River At The Bottom Of The Garden To Power Some Items ( Golf Buggies),,,,,
,160,Perhaps Consider Not Having Table Cloths In The Edwardian Grill  Even If Only Not In The Day Time.,,,,,
,161,As Already Mentioned  Lodges Should Have Separate Containers So Rubbish Can Be Collected For Recycling Or Disposal As Appropriate.,,,,,
,163,Our Window Was Very Draughty. If There Are Other Rooms Like This  Your Heating Bill Must Be A Lot More Than It Needs To Be.,,,,,
,166,The Facility Is A Bit Warm For My Taste Thus Could Turn The Heating Down,,,,,
,176,The Lodges Heating Was Up Too High,,,,,
,180,Nothing Comes To Mind.,,,,,
,182,In Other Hotels There Has Been A Note In The Bathrooms To Place Used Towels On The  Floor Or In The Bath  I Didn't Notice One Here. Bottled Water Was Provided Which Was Nice But Perhaps A Seperate Bin In The Bedroom For The Used Bottles Would Be Useful.,,,,,
,186,A Suggestion To Guests That They May Not Want Their Towels Changed Every Day If They Are Staying More Than One Night Could Be Easily Organised As Demonstrated In Many Other Hotels.,,,,,
,190,Not The Place For Wind Turbines Or Pv Panels.,,,,,
,193,Re Cycle Bins In Rooms For Paper Etc,,,,,
,197,Ask People To Hang Their Towels Up For Reuse Or Leave Them In The Bath To Be Changed. I Cannot Remember If You Do This Already - Many Top Hotels Use This System. Presumably You Already Recycle Waste From Guest Rooms Although It All Goes In One Waste Basket?,,,,,
,200,Find The Water Jugs! There Was The Mystery Of The Disappearing Water Jugs When We Were Staying. Bottled Water Obviously Has A Good Margin But Also Creates A Lot Of Waste.,,,,,
,208,No We Feel You Are Doing Fine.,,,,,
,232,It Was Really Sad To See The Poor Parrot In The Adams Room  Alone In Such A Small Cage.This Is The 21St Century  He Should Be In An Avery With Other Birds And Not Imprisoned Like He Is.,,,,,
,238,Our Room Was Very Warm And We Didn't Seem Able To Turn Off The Radiator And Had To Have The Window Open - Clearly Wasteful.,,,,,
,239,Drier Logs  Less Smoke More Heat!,,,,,
,242,Lights That Turn Off When Leaving Bedrooms!,,,,,
,243,I Think You Should Put A Notice In The Bathroom Asking Guests To Indicate If They Want Fresh Towels As It Seems Very Wasteful To Refresh The Towels Every Day.,,,,,
,249,No,,,,,
,250,We Segregated Empty Mineral Water Bottles In Our Room - Hopefully For Recycling.....We Hope This To Be The Case.,,,,,
,252,Make Some Kind Of Offer/Gift To Those That Use Public Transport (Or Perhaps For Business Conferences  Car Share) To Get To Bovey.,,,,,
,253,Not Tonight,,,,,
,259,Double Sided Printing And Less Thick Paper Rather Than The Heavy Duty Purple Backed Stuff You Send Out Maybe,,,,,
,264,I Don't Remember Seeing A Note In The Bathroom About Reusing Towels.  Would Have Been Happy To Be Reminded About That.  Felt The Dining Areas And Lounges Were Kept At A Rather High Temperature - Could Have Been Cooler And Still Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,269,Possibly Reduce The Heating Temperature  There Were Many Windows And Doors Open Because It Was Too Hot.,,,,,
,273,No,,,,,
,274,Other Hotels I Have Stayed In Ask You To Leave The Towels You Have Used In The Bath So They Are Not All Washed If Not Used.  I May Have Missed This Instruction At Bovey But Was Not Aware Of Such A Request   I Left My Towels In The Bath Anyway.,,,,,
,285,The Windows Were Quite Drafty,,,,,
,295,If The Wind Blows As Much Regularly As It Did During Our Visit - Maybe A Strategically Placed Wind Turbine And Some Solar Panels For The Swimming Pool.,,,,,
,297,Sat Nav Location Was Not Accurate  Causing Me To Drive Down Some Very Narrow Single Track Roads Wasting Both Time And Fuel. The Postal Code For Sat Nav Was Bovey Tracey  Some 11 Miles From The Final Destination And The Hotel/Course Was Not Listed In Points Of Intrest. Signposting Also Left A Lot To Be Desired. (Not Your Fault But Very Frustrating).,,,,,
,298,The Business Seems To Work Well As It It.  I Did Not Notice Any Situation That Could Have Been Improved On To Make It Greener.,,,,,
,301,Not Really,,,,,
,303,More Use Of Electric Vehicles Around The Property?,,,,,
,306,How Often Do You Change The Sheets / Towels In The Rooms For People Who Stay For A Few Nights ?  Do Guest Want Their Sheets And Towels Changed Every Day ? I Did Not See Any Notes On The Subject In Our Room.,,,,,
,311,Turn The Heating Down A Little. It Was Very Warm In The Rooms And Most Of Us Turned Our Radiators Off. However- There Is Nothing Worse Than Having A Cold Hotel  So There Has To Be A Medium,,,,,
,318,New Led Technology Might Be Considered  Not Only For The Environment  But Also For Cost Savings And Atmosphere. Especially In The Spa Area !,,,,,
,322,I Am Sure You Are Doing All You Can!!,,,,,
,333,Fewer Towels - They Were Everywhere !!!,,,,,
,334,Provide A Bin In The Lodge Which Has Separate Compartments For Glass / Cardboard / General Rubbish.,,,,,
,338,Mix The Hot And Could Water With One Tap And You'll Save A Lot Of Water!,,,,,
,340,Don't Believe In The Green Thing. One Big Con By The Government. So No Comments. Your Doing Just Fine.,,,,,
,342,It Would Be Okay To Ask That Guests Request Sheet And Towel Changes . I For One Would Be Happy To Reuse Both Over A Weekend,,,,,
,346,No You Did Very Well  You Kept The Heating To A Minimum!!,,,,,
,355,I Would Welcome Discrete Paper Recycling Stations ( You May Already Recycle Paper But I Was Conscious Of Mixing Paper And General Waste).,,,,,
,356,May Be Issue Less Towels Or At Least Give The Option For Guests To Re-Use Towels.,,,,,
,365,Maintain The Windows To Prevent Heat Escape. Our Room Windows Leaked When It Rained And Were Very Drafty.,,,,,
,367,You Could Remind Guests About Water Consumption And Make Sure That They Are Aware Of Unneccesary Laundry.,,,,,
,374,It Would Be Useful To Have A Separate Recycling Bin In The Lodge.,,,,,
,377,Towels Were Changed Too Often - Perhaps Strict Policy That They Should Only Be Changed If Left In Bath / Floor?,,,,,
,378,Reduce The Heat And Introduce Thermostats In Each Room,,,,,
,392,Not Sure Whether It Is Possible  But Offer The Golf Carts To Guests Who Wish To Visit Nearby Towns,,,,,
,393,Made Some Comments Last Time Round And These Would Still Apply - In Essence Not Too Much You Can Do.,,,,,
,395,More Recycling Facilities In The Lodges And More Encouragement To Use Them.  There's Space For Some Smart Bins. Turn The Hot Water Temperature Down A Couple Of Degrees.,,,,,
,396,There Was No Need To Replace The Towels And Toiletries Each Day  As We Would Have Been Happy To Have Selected An Option To Not Do This For The Two Nights Of Our Stay - Some Hotels Offer This Choice These Days.,,,,,
,397,Consider Not Changing Towels Daily And Allow Guests A Choice  Remove The Jaczzui Feature In The Pool  Its Wasted As Only Childern Use It  Turn Down Heating By Three Degrees Around Castle  Lose One Of The Range Rovers And Use Local Car Hire Firms  Vetted Trained And Approved For Collect And Drop Off At Rail And Air Links (Consider Reasonable Contract Terms For Similar Vehicles)  Let Beaky Go To A Home That Means He Is Out Of The Cage (This May Be The Case But As A Guest I Did Not See It)  And The Little Owl Should Have A Life Away From The Desk Area  Consider Offering Carbon Offset Charge,,,,,
,399,A Sign In Bathroom Saying If Towels Not Needed To Be Washed To Save The Planet Please Leave Sign Saying Leave Towels.  A Spin Dryer In Changing Rooms For Drying Costumes Wld Be Great. Radiators In Hotel Rooms Not Always Big Enough To Have Towels And Costumes On,,,,,
,402,Stay At The Gatehouse And Was Please To Have 3 Bin  One For Rubbish And The Other 2 Were For Recycling  Only Problem Was That They All Were Lined With The Same Blue Bags ????. So Was The Glass Etc  Recycled ????????,,,,,
,405,Probably Unnecessary To Light A Fire In The Lounges When The Temperature Has Been Over 25 Degrees Outside!,,,,,
,408,Not Sure If Can Be Applied To Main Building And/Or Lodges But Retrofitted Hvac Might Help On Re-Use Of Building Heat And Ultra-Fast Building Mangement Might Help For Light Management Without Leaving The Poor Guest Stranded In Pools Of Darkness. If You Have Not Missed The Boat Then Solar Pv Would Be A Boon I Think (And With Careful Placement Would Not Actually Be Seen)  Also Rain Harvest Would Work A Treat  Depending On Your Grounds Then Bore Hole For Heat Would Also Probably Work. I Think Anything That Requires Too Much Active Management By The Customer Would Detract From The Experience Therefore Should Be Passive From Customer Viewpoint.,,,,,
,409,Change Oil/Gas Boilers To Biomass,,,,,
,415,No Don't Worry About This.,,,,,
,422,Turn Down Service Replaced The Towels Which Had Only Been Used Once  I Said It Was Unecessary. Glad You Used Local Water In Glass Bottles How About Using Locally Made Toiletries If Possble Soap Ect  There's A Very Nice Soap Shop In Ashburton Ods And Suds I Think,,,,,
,423,The Tv In Our Room Had Been Left On For Our Arrival.,,,,,
,424,Lease See Comments Regarding The Heating. Should Save Quite A Lot On Heating.,,,,,
,436,Not Change All Towels Every Evening,,,,,
,443,I'm Sorry  I Am Never Very Good On This Subject.,,,,,
,445,The Single Use Hand Cloths In The Lavatories Are Possibly Less Eco Friendly Than Other Options.,,,,,
,455,Sorry  Nothing To Contribute On This Issue.,,,,,
,456,No,,,,,
,457,No,,,,,
,465,You May Do This Already (In Which Case I Missed It) But Asking Guests To Indicate Bath Towels That Need Changing By Putting Them In A Laundry Basket Or The Bath.  Other Hotels Use Refillable Soap/Shampoo Dispensers As Opposed To Miniatures  Which I Always Like.,,,,,
,471,Fewer Hand Towels And More Top-End Hand Dryers.,,,,,
,474,Ensure You Are Recycling Items - Glass Water Bottles In Rooms Etc. Have One Large Shower Gel Bottle Etc That Can Be Refilled Rather Than Using Lots Of Small Plastic Bottles For Toiletries. Seasonal And Local Produce In Restaurants If You Don't Already Do So - We Noticed The Speciality Yoghurt At Breakfast Came From Yorkshire  Surely There Is A Regional Alternative?,,,,,
,478,I Would Suggest That Towels Are Recycled.,,,,,
,483,There Is Always The Option Of Adding Double Glazing In The Rooms Although This May Detract From The Atmosphere In Room.,,,,,
,489,Recycling Is Crucial In Cabins. No Recycle Bin???,,,,,
,491,Include A Sign In The Bathroom That If Towels Do Not Need Replacement To Hang Up The Towel  Otherwise Put Them In The Bath. Signs Like This Are Very Much Appreciated By Environmentally Minded People.,,,,,
,498,Don't Have Tvs On  Make Them Easier To Turn Off Fully.,,,,,
,506,My Towels Were Always Replaced With Clean Ones Even Though I Hung Them Back On The Towel Rail.  I Was Happy To Use A Towel More Than Once.,,,,,
,517,No Not Really  But Forgot To Mention There Was No Phone Signal On Either 02 Or Orange So Was Difficult To Access The Internet Or General Use Of Our Phones - Not Sure What Could Be Done About It But Thought I Should Mention It!,,,,,
,528,I'd Be Intrigued To Know How Ecological It Is To Have Individual Handtowels In The Toilets  And An Option To Not Have Towels Washed Immediately From The Bathrooms Might Also Save Water/Electricity.,,,,,
,540,All Heating Was On All The Time (Which Was Great) Which Made The Rooms Very Warm And I Think We All Opened Our Windows To Let The Heat Out Given That It Was Quite Warm Outside For The Time Of Year. Perhaps A Sign In The Room Saying To Prompt Guests To Turn Off The Heating If They Are Warm?,,,,,
,541,The Hotel Was Extremely Warm Which Was Comfortable On The Most Part Except In The Bedroom Where It Was Baking And I Couldn't Open My Windows Due To The Flies.,,,,,
,553,One Of The Few Hotels I've Been To That Doesn't Make Any Mention Of Not Washing Towels Every Day,,,,,
,558,None,,,,,
,563,Tap Water Where Feasible Rather Than Bought Bottled,,,,,
,569,.,,,,,
,575,Email Final Invoices.,,,,,
,579,Keep Everything As It Is!,,,,,
,587,We Weren't Able To Recycle Tins/ Cans At Rose Cottage  There Wasn't A Bin Provided For That Purpose (Perhaps The Restricted Kitchen Space Doesn't Allow For It Though?).  The Heating Was On Full Blast Continuously When We Arrived.  I'm Not Sure If There Is A Thermostat  But I Didn't Find One.  I Would Suggest If The Heating Is Meant To Remain On Continuously  The Thermostat Temperature Should Be Set Lower  As It Really Was Too Warm In The House.,,,,,
,597,The Pool Area Was Far Too Hot - A Couple Of Degrees Lower Would Certainly Save Some Energy Without Disrupting The Experience.,,,,,
,601,Turn The Heating Down  The Whole Place Was Very Hot  Not Just Warm.,,,,,
,603,No I Think You Are Addressing This Very Well Considering The Size Of The Hotel. Maybe Some Visible Recycling Bins For The Water Provided Out In The Entrance May Be Nice.,,,,,
,609,There Weren't The Usual Signs In The Bathroom Encouraging Guests To Reuse Towels That Seem To Be Ubiquitous In Most Establishments These Days. The Lightbulbs In The Rooms Could Be Low-Wattage Or Similar.  Lights In The Bathrooms Could Be Automatic (Movement Sensored).,,,,,
,618,Skip The Wheather Report In The Room.,,,,,
,640,It Seemed Like Plastic Cup City In The Swimming Pool Area And In The Changing Rooms. Are Those Plastic Cups Recycled And Recyclable? If Not  This Needs To Be Addressed Asap. There Are Other Alternative Too.,,,,,
,643,Perhaps Doing What So Many Hotels Do Now And Asking People If They Want To Reuse Their Towels Instead Of Having Clean Ones Every Day.,,,,,
,645,We Notice You Recycle A Lot But Not Tins? ( I Think It Was Tins),,,,,
,650,Don't Use Big Jaguar's That Cost A Fortune To Run And Dont Cope Well With Roads And Make Passengers Feel Sick. Might Not Then Not Have To Charge Â£72 For Journey To Exeter That Made Us Sick. The Poor Restaurant Service Could Probably Get Over  If It Improves (Though I See Tripadvisor.Com Has Many Similar Poor Service Comments) And Would Like To Come Again Then. But The Charge For Collection Left Very Bad Taste When Added To The Restaurant Offering Where Food In Bistro Was Very Good Value  Was Average Food In Formal Restaurant And Average Value  But Very Poor Service,,,,,
,652,You Will No Doubt Have Looked Into This Already But Maybe The Land Rovers Could Run On Gas?,,,,,
,660,Put Solar Panels On The Roof,,,,,
,676,Working In Renewable Energy Business I Did Not See Any Renewable Energy Or Any Mention Of It. Surely There Could Be Something.,,,,,
,683,Perhaps If The Shower Screens Were More Secure We Would Need To Use Fewer Towels To Mop Up The Floor Every Day?  Perhaps Branded And Reusable Water Bottles For The Guests So They Use Less Bottles Of Water?,,,,,
,685,Am Not The Greenest Myself  Nothing Really Stood Out.,,,,,
,702,Please Don't Sacrifice The Service Or Facilities For The Sake Of 'Greeness'.,,,,,
,705,Tell Hotel Guest To Out Their Towles In The Tub If They Want Them Washed Otherwise Hang Them Up.  Hotel Rooms Were Very Hot. Explain To People How To Operate Radiators,,,,,
,713,Pir (Motion Detector) For Lighting Especially In Rooms Such As The Library That Had Nobody In It On The Sunday. Also You Could Change (You May Have Already) To The 8 Watt Bulbs From The 40/50 Watt Spots That Are Now Into Phase 2 And Give Off A Good Quality Light And Last For 40 000 Rather Than 2 000 Hours This Would Pay For Itself I Suspect Within Eighteen Months And Then Represent A Huge Cost Saving.,,,,,
,721,You Own A Bunch Of Land Rover Discoveries  You Have Got To Be Kidding:)  (So Do We.),,,,,
,730,We Couldn't See How To Switch Off The Fire In The Lodge And So Left It On Overnight.,,,,,
,744,The Lodge Was Lovely And Warm But We Noticed That The Hot Water And Heating Were On Continuously - I Understand The Lodge Tanks Are Quite Small (We Ran Out Of Hw A Couple Of Times!) But Maybe You Could Consider Switching These Off Between Say 1Am-5Am Which Across All The Lodges Might Make A Small Environmental Impact.,,,,,
,746,Water Conservation Could Be Better In All Bathrooms And Public Toilet Areas,,,,,
,759,Stop Replacing Clean Towels! However  Every Hotel Is Guilty Of This.,,,,,
,760,No  And This Is Not A Factor When I Choose Hotels.,,,,,
,767,Rent Out Bikes?,,,,,
,771,The Lodges Did Not Appear To Have Separate Bins For Recycling Plastic And Paper Etc...,,,,,
,773,Not Sure What Your Recycling Is  But Maybe Provide Some Extra Bins For Eg Plastic/ Cardboard/ Glass? Very Good To See The Compost Bin.,,,,,
,777,Light In The Lodge - Master Light To Make It Easy To Turn It All Off When Leaving.,,,,,
,781,Don't Use Miniatures In The Bathrooms  Use Large Refillable Bottles. Although I Am Sure Guests Would Prefer Items They Can Take Away With Them!,,,,,
,786,Do You Recycle From Bins N The Lodges? No Notices About That As Far As I Could See,,,,,
,792,N/A,,,,,
,795,No,,,,,
,799,Although Lodges Can Seperate Rubbish-No-Where That We Can Take It To,,,,,
,801,A Cinema Room For Children Would Work Really Well And Allow The Adults Some Freedom.,,,,,
,802,Turn The Heating Down A Bit.  Install Thermostats In The Rooms As People Usually Like To Sleep In A Cool Room.,,,,,
,804,Make The Recycling In The Lodges Easier - Bins/Bags Could Be Marked With What They Should Contain.,,,,,
,812,Use Ipads For Menus  In Rooms For Information !,,,,,
,818,Consider More Led Lighting,,,,,
,830,N/A,,,,,
,833,More Emphasis On Asking People Not To Use Towels Once And Then Get Them Replaced.,,,,,
,836,The Size And Age Of The Building Must Present A Real Challenge And A Massive Energy Bill ! To Be Fair The Hotel Was Very Comfortable At All Times.,,,,,
,847,Collect Metal For Recycling - The Lodge Only Had Bins For Paper  Plastic And Glass,,,,,
,848,I Like A Warm House  But The Indoor Temperature Was Rather Too High.  I Thought You Could Have Turned Down The Thermostat A Degree Or Even 2 And It Still Have Been Plenty Warm Enough.  Your Heating Bills Must Be Astronomic.,,,,,
,849,? Electric Golf Carts.  Our Room Was Right By Where The Carts Were Being Driven So Was Sort Of Noisy  Perhaps There Could Be A Transition To Electric Golf And Service Carts.    Just Remembered  Regarding The Room  The Electric Tea Pot  Was Not Sure Were To Use And Could Use A Tea Pot Friendly Safe Location That Would Reach An Electrical Outlet.  The Night Stand Was Wood And Could Have Used A Glass Top Or A Designated Area To Use The Tea Pot Since This Was Boiling Water Had To Be Careful With The Furnishings.,,,,,
,852,Don't Drive The Housekeeping/Maintenance Vehicles Around The Grounds Like It Is A Raceway!!,,,,,
,854,Don't Buy So Many Nuts At Christmas.There Must Have Been Several Years Supply There And The Nut Crackers Were Useless  So We Didn't Eat Many.,,,,,
,859,Yes - Less Heating (This Is Becoming A Bit Tedious Right?),,,,,
,868,There Was No Indication Of Recycling Of Our Rubbish From The Lodge Ie No Recycling Bin Bags Where Should Bottles Go? Waste Paper Etc,,,,,
,879,Towels Could Be Reused - They Were Replaced After A Shower But Could Have Been Used Again Willingly The Next Morning,,,,,
,896,The Hotel Was Pretty Hot. Perhaps Monitor/Keep The Temperature Slightly Lower.,,,,,
,904,Little Thing  But Try Using Clear Glass Jars Or Something For The Biscuits And Fudge. You Could Make These Very Tastefully (As A North Devonian I'd Of Course Suggest Dartington Glass?)  And Sell Them As Souvenirs As Well. My Usual Rule Is That If I Have To Throw It In The Bin  It's A Waste. So Farewell  Little Cellophane Bags! In Fact  One Of Your Activities Could Be Fudge-Making  So That People Can See It Being Made  And You Could Make All Your Fudge (Including Clotted Cream  Of Course)  Use It For Wedding Favours  Petit Fours  Turn-Down Treats And Sell It As A Memento  Souvenir Etc. Saves On Transport Costs.,,,,,
,906,Offer Recycling Bins In Your Rooms - We All Have These At Home In Our Houses ! The Thermostat In Our Lodge Is In The Boiler Room So Only Way To Have Heating On Is To Set It To 28 Degrees ! I Would Say You Are Far From Having An Environment Friendly Approach !,,,,,
,907,No,,,,,
,918,The Lodges Have No Recycling Bins. The Boiler Seemed To Be On All The Time And Even With The Heating Off The Heat From The Boilers Made The Lodge Very Warm .,,,,,
,920,Get The Heating Working Better In The Lodge So We Don't Have To Have The Window Open All The Time!,,,,,
,925,Very Hot Throughout The Hotel,,,,,
,926,Implement Recycling Bins At The Lodges. Reduce Heating Costs - Towel Rails Etc Seemed To Be On Continuously.,,,,,
,928,The Walks Around The Estate Were Fantastic  But Some Discreet Signage Relating To Nature And Wildlife Or A Nature Trail For Families Would Be An Asset.,,,,,
,929,Don't Use White Tablecloths!  Why Not Just Wipe The Tables In The Edwardian Dining Room Where We Had Breakfast,,,,,
,938,Don't Have The Heating On In The Lodges All The Time!  When We Arrived We Found The Lodge Far Too Hot And Turned All The Radiators Right Down  And The Thermostat Too!,,,,,
,947,Turn The Heat Down!,,,,,
,949,Yes- Dig Up The Golf Course.,,,,,
,969,Turn The Heating Down As Really Sweltering.,,,,,
,971,Recycling Point For All The Newspapers Around The Hotel.,,,,,
,975,Sorry No.,,,,,
,997,Use Of Discrete Solar Panels,,,,,
,998,Sorry To Say I Can't Think Of Anything.  I Do Think That Towels And Bed Linens Do Not Have To Be Changed Everyday ........ So That's A Good Thing That You Are Doing.,,,,,
,1000,N/A,,,,,
,1001,Management Of Towel Use.,,,,,
,1002,No.,,,,,
,1003,Less Heat In Rooms.,,,,,
,1007,Hand Towels (Smaller - The Large Towels Aren't Needed For Simple Face Washing And Then You Have To Have More Loads Of Washes Just To Clean Them All  Vs. The Many More Hand Towels That You Could Wash In The Same Load)   Better Toilet Flushing -Definitely Used A Lot Of Water Trying To Make It Work Single Faucet Sinks - Running Two Streams Of Water To Try To Wash My Face And So Forth Is Just A Total Waste.   At First I Thought It Was A Plumbing Issue - But Then I Noticed The Public Ladies Room Had Single Faucet  So Obviously It's Possible.  Maybe You Have Double Faucets In The Rooms Since People Think It's Quaint?   Anyway  Waste Of Water.    As An Aside - Some Kind Of Shelf To Hold Toiletries Would Be A Good Room Improvement.  I Do Not Having To Keep My Toiletries All Over My Room Since There Is No Place In The Bathroom Other Than On The Toilet Lid (Yuck).,,,,,
,1021,Sorry I Am Reasonably Sensible And Respectful Re All Of These Issues But It Is Not High On My Agenda,,,,,
,1027,No,,,,,
,1040,If Guests Stay Longer Than One Night  Are They Given The Option Of Not Having Clean Linen/Towels Every Day?,,,,,
,1041,The Use Of Individual Terry Hand Towels In The Communal Toilets  Though A Wonderful Experience  Seems Rather Labour Intensive  As One Wipe And Then They Need Washing Again.   Perhaps A Hand Dryer Would Be Less Wasteful.,,,,,
,1047,No,,,,,
,1053,No.,,,,,
,1055,Not As Noticed.,,,,,
,1061,No Idea But The Towels Being Used And We Saw Coming In And Out Of The Swimming Pool Maybe?,,,,,
,1063,It Seed You Were Doing Well. Though Some May Feel That The Fires Were Not Necessary In June  It Was So Wet And Cold That They Were Very Necessary For Creating The Absence And Warmth That Was So Needed. We Would Have Been Very Unhappy Had They Not Been In Use.,,,,,
,1067,No Obvious Waste,,,,,
,1071,The Room Did Tend To Be Too Warm In The Evening. Perhaps A Thermostat In Each Room Could Help To Reduce Overall Heating Costs.,,,,,
,1072,No,,,,,
,1075,If Guests Were Staying For Several Days Then A System Of Only Replacing Towels Put In Say The Shower Could Be Washed  Rather Than Replacing All Of Them.,,,,,
,1076,No.,,,,,
,1078,Only Replace Towels When Asked To Do So (Towels Left In Baths Indicate Need Changing).,,,,,
,1083,Automated Lighting.,,,,,
,1088,Don't Use Such Thick Loo Paper. I'm Sure You'll Have System Flushing Problems Because Of It.,,,,,
,1089,Double Glazing In All The Lodge Windows  Especially The Master Bedrooms With Three Outside Walls,,,,,
,1091,I Did Not Notice Any Information For Guests About The Hotel Environmental Policy  Recycling Etc But Perhaps I Missed It.  Nor Did I Notice Requests To Turn Off Lights When Leaving Room  Reusing Towels If Staying For More Than 1 Night Etc.  This Can Make People Feel That You Take A Responsible View Towards The Environment And Them Feel Guilty (Perhaps) If They Are Wasteful Or Extravagant.,,,,,
,1098,No,,,,,
,1105,No,,,,,
,1107,No,,,,,
,1124,No,,,,,
,1128,We Were Aware Of The Steps Taken To Respect The Environment  And Couldnot Add To The Process.,,,,,
,1135,The Bin In The Pool Changing Room Was Full Of Ladies Flip/Flops - Are These Thrown Out Or Recycled?,,,,,
,1142,Short Of Making Everyone Bathe Or Shower In Cold Water  Covering The Golf Course In Giant Windmills And Serving Only Vegan Food In The Restaurants  Well.....Er  No! Seriously  You're Such Caring People I'm Sure You're Doing More Than Your 'Bit' For The Dreaded Environment Already!,,,,,
,1148,Suggest Radiators Are Left On Very Low Settings In Each Guest Bedroom For The Arrival Of Guests  With A Card Explaining How The Heat Can Be Increased.  Our Radiator Was Set To Maximum  So We Turned It Off And Still Had To Have The Windows Open To Cool Down  Obviously Due To The Heat Within The Whole Hotel.,,,,,
,1155,No,,,,,
,1156,No,,,,,
,1162,This Is A Silly Question!,,,,,
,1166,No,,,,,
,1169,Separate Out Compostable Refuse In The Lodges,,,,,

,1182,Only One - How May I Not Lose So Many Golf Balls In The River?!,,,,,
,1184,This Is Just A Question...Do You Recycle?  I Did Not See Anywhere That You Did  But I Left My Empty Bottles Of Water Out For Pick Up Just In Case.,,,,,
,1185,At This Point Your Focus Should Be On The Bigger Issues.,,,,,
,1195,The Kitchen Tended To Waste Food.   When One Sausage Was Requested  Two Were Sent. When One Poached Egg Was Requested  Two Were Sent.,,,,,
,1196,No - It Is Good Now,,,,,
,1207,No Need To Wash Towels Every Day,,,,,
,1212,Recycling See Above,,,,,
,1216,No,,,,,
,1236,Again  We Have Discussed This - But As A Professionally Run Business You Appear To Have Covered All Eventualities.,,,,,
,1237,No,,,,,
,1238,Instead Of Having Small Individual Bottles Of Water At The Turn Down Service Have Jugs Of Iced Water And Lemon - With A Lid.,,,,,
,1241,Sorry  Can't Think Of Anything? I Thought The Focus On Local Produce Was A Real Positive In That Respect.,,,,,
,1245,Are The Glass Water Bottles From The Rooms Recycled?,,,,,
,1247,I Think  You Could Possibly Use Organic Toiletries  So That The Waste Would Be Biodegradable.,,,,,
,1249,Difficult To Say Without Knowing More. How Is Your Swimming Pool Heated? Perhaps Solar Heating Could Be Installed On The Roof. This Could Also Be Used For Regular Water Heating.  Other Organisations Do Take Some Interesting Steps - Such As Glyndebourne Opera House  Which Has It's Own Wind Turbine And I Believe Is Just About Energy Sufficient. Wind Power Is One Of The More Effective 'Green' Energy Sources  Though Controversial As There's No Output When There's No Wind  And Also Not Everyone Likes Wind Turbines. There Is Still A Need For Backup Energy Supplies.  Photo-Voltaic Cells Are Somewhat Controversial. We Have Them At Home  But There Is No Doubt That They Are Dubious Economically  And Can Be Seen As A Regressive Taxation On Those Who Can't Afford To Install Them. If You Can Fit Them For A Relatively Low Installation Price  Then They Could Be Helpful.  You Could Perhaps Use Rainwater For Flushing Toilets Etc.  And Look Into Grey Water Operation.  Some Buildings Also Use Heat Pumps For Heat/Air Conditioning - For Example This One - Http://Business.Kingston.Ac.Uk/News-Events/News/201204/Air-Chief-Willie-Walsh-Opens-New-Kinsgton-Business-School-Building Kingston University Business School  ,,,,,
,1251,Recycle The Rain Water From The Considerable Roof Space To Water The Greens,,,,,
,1253,Impressed With The Use Of River Water Nothing Else To Add,,,,,
,1255,The Weather Forecast Was Really Welcome Everyday But It Would Be Great If There Was A Way That It Could Be Delivered Without Printing It. Clearer Instructions On Recycling Too Would Have Been Welcome - For Example It Didn't Appear Possible To Recycle Tins.,,,,,
,1258,Don't Replace Towels And  Toiletries Unless Requested,,,,,
,1259,Ground Source Heat Pump To Help Heat The Swimming Pool?,,,,,
,1260,In Some Hotels We Have Seen Waste Bins Where Guests Can Separate Different Kinds Of Rubbish Even In Their Rooms  In Some Hotels They Provide Filetered Drinking Water In The Same Bottles - We Like It But You Know Your Regular Guests - If They Are Used To Bottled Water Of High Quality - They Might Mind It....,,,,,
,1263,Don't Print Off The Numerous Pages Of The Bill On Paper  Show The Patron The Bill On An Electronic Devie (Ipad Etc.) And Then Email The Full Bill.,,,,,
,1265,No,,,,,
,1267,Recyclycling In The Lodges Is A Must. Everything Just Goes Into A General Waste Sack,,,,,
,1281,Make The Fires Easier To Turn Off In Your Lodges. In The Dark People Cannot Find The Knobs - And I Understand That The Lodges Can Get Very Warm,,,,,
,1285,Possible Look At Installing Auto Light Switch Off When Guest Vacate Rooms This May Make An Massive Saving On Your Utilities Bills,,,,,
,1287,Solar Collectors Or A Wind Mill Or Geothermal Heat Pump.,,,,,
,1290,Yes - I Would Like To Suggest A Bottled Water System That You Could Install Where You Re-Use Bottles And Can Fill Them Up From A Machine That Is Purified Through The Mains And You Can Select Fizzy Or Still.  Please Call Me If You Are Interested To Find Out More Information.  07767 887852,,,,,
,1299,Ensure That All Food Is Sourced As Locally As Possible So That It Does Not Have Far To Travel.,,,,,
,1301,Have You Looked At Solar Panel Electricity Generation.,,,,,
,1305,Some Areas Of The Hotel Were Very Warm (Eg Corridor From Reception To Bistro) Which Led Us To Wonder About The Cost Of Heating.,,,,,
,1312,Automatic Lights That Come On When You Enter The Room.,,,,,
,1316,The Heating Was On Full Blast When We Arrived Which Meant It Was Like A Sauna In The Lodge Plus The Gas Fire Was Going; That Might Help And Running A Fleet Of Jags Seems An Odd 'Green' Choice - Perhaps Buggies Might Be Better,,,,,
,1321,Redesign Or Just Switch Off The Kitchen Ventilators That Make Such A Noise At The Back Of The Building.,,,,,
,1322,No,,,,,
,1324,Some Pigs  Head Of Stock  Geese  From Farm To Fork ! Lol,,,,,
,1325,The Bedrooms Were Very Hot Therefore The Heating Could Be Turned Down Whilst Still Maintaining A Comfortable Temperature.,,,,,
,1331,I Assume The Slippers Which Accompany The Robes In The Room Are Disposable.Is There An Alternative?,,,,,
,1337,Sorry Not My Forte,,,,,
,1339,Turn Lights Off During Day.,,,,,
,1346,Turning Lights Off When Not Needed (Or Putting On Timer Switches),,,,,
,1352,Why Change Near Perfection?,,,,,

,1357,None,,,,,
,1358,None,,,,,
,1359,Ask The Guest If They Would Like Their Invoice Emailed Instead Of Being Printed?,,,,,
,1361,Only Change Towels If Explicitly Requested By Guests.,,,,,
,1364,It Wasn't Necessary To Replace The Soaps Every Day And Certainly Not At Night As Well As In The Morning.,,,,,
,1365,I Noticed The Company Is Registered Overseas - Perhaps You Could Pay Taxes In This Country And Contribute To The Economy A Little More!  Whilst Elemis Are Lovely Products Surely There Are Local Products Which You Could Use Instead.,,,,,
,1366,Can't Think Of Anything At The Moment.,,,,,
,1370,We Are Currently Working On A 'Green Machine' Which Would Make A Very Significant Difference To Costs And Carbon Footprint Of The Hotel. If You Are Interested In Pursuing This Further Please Contact Me On Nikisimon@Bloomberg.Net,,,,,

,1376,Switch Of Air Conditioning And Cooler Units Not Actually Needed At Night.,,,,,
,1378,You Seem To Be Doing A Pretty Good Job To Me.,,,,,
,1380,It Was Very Hot On The Weekend That We Visited And The Radiators In Our Room Were On  These Could Be Turned Down/Off In Such Hot Weather.,,,,,
,1385,Not Off Hand.,,,,,
,1394,Loved The Experience Would Have Been Good To Know There Things Happening Prior To Our Stay Ie Activitoes,,,,,
,1397,Temperature Controlled Rooms,,,,,
,1412,I Am Sorry I Have No Idear.,,,,,
,1414,The Overall Comfort Zones Throughout Your Establishment  Whether It Be Room Or Swimming Pool Temperatures Are Important - Their Achievement Was Subtle Without Unsightly Oil Tanks Or Tall Chimneys For Emissions. The On-Going Quest For A Efficient & Non-Intrusive Impact To The Environment Is Commendable !!,,,,,
,1415,Our Room Was Very Hot Throughout The Night  We Had The Window Open But The Radiator Was On. Perhaps The Heating Could Be Turned Off For A Period Throughout The Day?,,,,,
,1416,The Bottles You Supply Toiletries In Are Quite Large Maybe Sachets Of Same Standard - Once Used You Cannot Keep For Someone Else And For An Overnight Stay I'd Say The Bottles Were A Bit Too Big - Probably Save Money Too!,,,,,
,1419,Re-Cycling Bins In The Lodge Kitchen - We Are All Quite Used To Separating Plastics  Glass  Paper And Cans In Our Homes.  Have A Kitchen Garden For Produce?  It Would Be Lovely To Collect Fresh Herbs For Cooking With.,,,,,
,1423,No,,,,,
,1426,Maybe Not Change The Towels  We Stayed For Three Nights And Had New Towels Everyday.  Maybe Guests Could Leave Them In The Bath If They Require New Ones.,,,,,
,1427,No Need To Replace Flannels After Being Used Once.,,,,,
,1428,Proximity Sensors To Control Lighting In Corridors & A Kitchen Garden .,,,,,
,1430,Solar Panels   Hydro Electricity?,,,,,
,1432,None At All,,,,,
,1434,Install Hand Dryers - Although The Flannels Are A Lovely Idea And Very Presentable It Will Take A Lot Of Washing Powder Everyday To Wash Them  & That Takes A Lot Of Energy To Power Too  Ultimately Polluting The Environment. Also The Amount It Must Cost To Wash Them - You Could Save Yourselves Several Hundred Pounds I Am Sure.,,,,,
,1438,Leave Messages On Interactive Tv....Although Personal Letters Were Well Received!,,,,,
,1441,Have A Vegetable Garden Where You Can Grow Some Of Your Own Supplies.  Keep Chickens And Ducks So That You Can Have Fresh Eggs. Carbon Foot Print Down Xxx,,,,,
,1444,Admirable Ethos But This Conflicts With Why I Go To Your Hotel,,,,,
,1446,Turn Off Tv And Ipod Speakers,,,,,
,1447,Use Solar Energy  Photovoltaics  Ground Source Heat Pump And Heat Exchangers.,,,,,
,1448,We'll Think About It.,,,,,
,1451,Some Hotels Say That If You Need Your Towels Washing To Place Them In The Bath - If You Don't Then The Guest Is Happy To Use Them Again. Might Be Useful In The Future!,,,,,
,1453,Possible Renewable Energies E.G Ground Source Heating For The Swimming Pool.  Greater Use Of Led Lighting Particularly In The Lodges.,,,,,
,1454,We Found Our Room Very Warm. Whilst Better Than Too Cold  The Temperature Could Be Turned Down A Bit.,,,,,
,1455,It's A Challenge Nothing Comes To Mind .,,,,,
,1460,Energy Saving Light Bulbs And Rely More On Candles In The Edwardian Grill Not Just For Energy But For Ambience Too.,,,,,
,1465,No - We Were Very Impressed By How 'Green' The Hotel Already Is.,,,,,
,1467,A Market Garden In Your Grounds Somewhere To Provide Yourselves With Some Homegrown Vegetables And Salad. People Would Appreciate This And You Would Reduce 'Food Miles' On Your Meals.,,,,,
,1472,Make General Recycling Bins Available Somewhere - The Bins In The Lodges Are Too Small For A Family For More Than A Couple Of Days. We Resorted To A Single Rubbish Sack In The End But We Would Have Continued Sorting Had We Anywhere Top Put It.,,,,,
,1473,This Is A Very Difficult Issue  But I Think You Are Doing Your Best Here...Of Course There Are Things  Like Limiting The Number Of Towels To Each Guest At The Pool  But  And This I Feel Is Quite A Big But  The Luxury To Your Guests Of Being Able To Use As Many As They Want Is All Part Of The Pampered Experience That We Come To This Sort Of Hotel For...(Selfish People That We Are!!),,,,,
,1479,It Would Be Wonderful If You Could Grow More Of Your Own Vegetables Etc In The Grounds To Be Used Within The Restaurants  Maybe.,,,,,
,1485,No,,,,,
,1486,Possibly An Explanation Of How The Recycling Bins Work In The Cottage Then And A Collection Point For Out Of Date Newspapers. I Also Can't Ehlp Notice How Much Food We Threw Out When We Left  Not A  Vast Amount  But Clearer Information About What The Cottage Rovides  Eg There Are No Staples Like Cleaning Fluids  Cling Film  Cooking Oil In The Cottage. These Are All Things I Bring And Then Have To Bring Home Again. In Other Places We Have Stayed  Some Of The More 'Basic' Kitchen Items Can Be Found. I Did Notice This Year That Slippers  Robes  Etc Are Now Chargeable.I Would Rather Pay An Extra Â£10 On My Bill That Took Into Account Soaps  Toiletries  Etc Than Face The Dumming Down Of A Few Items. Whilst The Green Issue Is An Important One - There Are Bottom Line Savings That Can Be Disguised As Green- But To The Consumer Appear To Be Cost Cutting In Hard Times. There Is A Danger That Too Many Changes In Any One Year For ' Regular' Hotel Users Are Mis Interpreted.,,,,,
,1490,2 Bins In The Room  A Recyclable And Non Recyclable One Would Be Useful As All The Rubbish Gets Mixed,,,,,
,1492,No Everything Seemed Fine.,,,,,
,1499,No,,,,,
,1502,Introduce Recycling Bins In The Lodges. It Seemed That There Was No Effort To Separate Plastics Etc From Day To Day Waste.,,,,,
,1504,Have You Considered Hydro Electricity With All The Rivers In The Valley ?,,,,,
,1505,The Installation Of Solar Pannels At The Lodges.,,,,,
,1514,We Stayed In A Lodge. There Was No Recycling Bins Available To Us. They Could Easily Be Stored Outside The Front Door.,,,,,
,1517,No,,,,,
,1521,Not Really.,,,,,
,1522,Clean Out Rubbish From The Ponds You Walk By To Go To The Golf Practice Range.,,,,,
,1523,No Changes,,,,,
,1524,I Didn't See A Notice In The Bathroom Asking If We'd Like To Retain Our Towels/Sheets For Further Use  And In Fact One Towel Was Changed At Turndown. Most Guests I Feel Would Be Happy To Re-Use.  Our Room Seemed Very Over-Heated In The Night  But I Couldn't Detect A Heated Radiator While I Was Pacing In The Moonlight.... Is There Background Heating That Might Be Turned Down A Few Degrees?  And Maybe Set The Radiators In Rooms To 'Low' As The Default...,,,,,
,1525,No Sadly...,,,,,
,1526,Not Off The Top Of My Head.,,,,,
,1530,No,,,,,
,1535,Great Question. I Would Leave A Note In The Rooms Like Dirty Towels You Want Changed Put In Bathtub As A Sign To Room Service. Maybe Also At Checkin Ask Which Papers If Any They Want Brought To The Room So It's Not Wasted.,,,,,
,1537,Recycling Bins Weren't In Lodge This Time.,,,,,
,1539,We Would Have Liked To Be Clearer About What To Do With Our Recycling When Staying In A Lodge. We Were Not Sure If There Was Somewhere We Could Put Bottles  Cardboard  Tins Etc So We Did Throw A Few Things Away And Ended Up Taking Some Home.,,,,,
,1548,No!,,,,,
,1549,No,,,,,
,1550,I Think That You Have Done Everything Possible To Have A Greener Business.  I Am Saddened That You Have Removed The Postcards From The Reception Area But I Cannot Think Of Anything Further To Add.,,,,,
,1553,Nothing That Comes To Mind.,,,,,
,1554,No.,,,,,
,1557,Not At This Present Time....,,,,,
,1560,No,,,,,
,1563,No.,,,,,
,1564,None I Think You Do All You Can Remembering The Near Perfection You Offer Your Guests Thank You For  That,,,,,
,1567,Wonderful About The Water But Needed The Info Card In The Bathroom As So You Understand When You Are Using The Water. Use Recycled Toilet Paper And Use Less Pakaging For Your Extra Bathroom Bits I.E Toothbrush  Shave Kit  Lovely Touch But I Dont Think Needed  Have All These Bits In Reception If Guests Require Them. More Places In The Bathroom To Hang Your Towels To Dry So You Can Re-Use Them.,,,,,
,1570,I Am Sorry But I Don't. We Liked The Idea That You Use The Water From Local Sources And Thoroughly Approve Of Current Hotel Practice Of Not Laundering Towels Every Day.,,,,,
,1572,It Was A Very Cosy And Enjoyable Stay  But At Times It Was Too Hot In The Stair Wells And At Night. Maybe Reducing The Heating Slightly Could Enhance Your Energy Efficiency.,,,,,
,1574,N/A,,,,,
,1575,From A Guest Point Of View (Front Of House) It Would Be Hard To Say  But I Honestly Feel Form What I Saw All You Can Do Is Being Done.  Congratulations.,,,,,
,1579, We Recycle At Our House And Are Used To Putting Paper Etc In Separate Containers But Were Unsure Where To Put What  There Were Various Bins In The Kitchen But Which Was Which ?,,,,,
,1580,No,,,,,
,1581,I Wasn't Sure What To Do With The Towels I Used (Some Hotels Have A Note In The Bathroom Saying Leave Any Used Towels In The Bath So Housekeeping Don't Have To Always Wash Them All). That Might Be A Good Idea.,,,,,
,1588,Give Guests The Opportunity To Opt For An Electronic Itemised Account Rather Than A Printed Copy.,,,,,
,1590,Check How Beds In Lodges Need To Be Configured Before Guests Arrive Do That Bedding Does Not Have To Be Completely Changed After First Night,,,,,
,1592,Locally Sourced Real Ales On Draught - Less Chemicals  Less Packaging  Less Travel Miles And More Supportive Of Local Industry.  And More In Keeping With Bovey Than Euro/American Fizz.,,,,,
,1597,Never Mind Greener...Put More Toiletries In The Bathrooms,,,,,
,1601,As With All Hotels It Seemed Very Hot In The Rooms  Maybe Guests Could Be Given The Option Of Turning Off Their Heating Rather Than Just Opening The Window?,,,,,
,1603,Turn The Heating Down!,,,,,
,1607,Dont Sell Christal In Such Big Bottles!!!!!,,,,,
,1609,Renewable Energy - Not Sure If You Use Solar  Wind Or Hydro But Feel Sure You Could Make Use Of These. After See The Sizes Of The Cars In Your Car Park I Would Offer A Discount To Anyone Arriving In An Electric Car!,,,,,
,1610,No,,,,,
,1613,Source Your Food Locally And Have A Seasonal Menu.,,,,,
,1614,Electronic Signing For Room Bills - On An Ipad Type System,,,,,
,1620,Yes  Stop Making Mistakes And Printing Out Copies Of Bills.,,,,,
,1621,Recycle? Do Not Leave Radiators On So High?,,,,,
,1626,No Sorry. It Seems Very Green Anyway.,,,,,
,1638,Not My Area Of Expertise Sorry.  Thought You Did A Great Job.,,,,,
,1647,Recycling Bins Within The Lodges. Solar Pv Panels To Generate Electricity,,,,,
,1649,More Road Signage So You Dont Waste Fuel Taking The Wrong Turns And End Up Arriving Through Delivery Entrance!,,,,,
,1651,Turn The Hot Water System Down In B1 Lodge ,,,,,
,1655,I Think We Used The Same Towels That We Had From Day 1 -- I Don't Have A Problem With That.  We Found The Castle To Be Very Warm -- But We Came Prepared For Drafty Rooms.  That Was Not The Case -- Which Was Pleasant. But You Could Turn The Heat Down A Bit!,,,,,
,1663,There Seemed To Be A Lot Of Towels Being Used In The Pool So I Wondered Maybe If You Could Limit How Many People Have? Apart Fro. That I Think You Do A Great Job,,,,,
,1664,Sorry  Can't Think Of Any...,,,,,
,1667,On Departure  Whilst It Looks Professional  Is It Really Necessary To Put The Invoice Into An Envelope?  By Not Doing This (Or Asking The Client If They Would Like Their Invoice In An Envelope (I Suspect The Majority Would Decline This Offer)) A Huge Amount Of Stationery Could Be Saved.,,,,,
,1672,There Was No Mention Of Recycling In The Cottage. Perhaps There Should Be Facilities To Separate Glass  Plastics  Paper Etc. Also  When We Arrived At Rose Cottage On What Was A Very Hot Day  Every Light Was On And One Of The Fires! Probably Nice In The Winter To Have A Couple Of Lamps And The Fire On But Don't Think It Was Necessary At This Time Of Year.,,,,,
,1674,Energy Consumption - It Was Difficult To Turn Down The Heating In The Bedroom. We Therefore Resorted To Opening The Window Thereby Heating The Environment.,,,,,
,1676,No,,,,,
,1680,Restrict The Use Of Bath Robes And Slippers - These Were Being Tossed Around In The Swimming Pool Changing Area As Though They Were Disposable.,,,,,
,1681,Solar,,,,,
,1683,Towels Could Be Reused At The Guests Requests; Have Guest Hang Towel Back Up And If They Want Them Washed Have Them Placed On The Floor Or In The Shower Tub.,,,,,
,1688,Ensure Windows Close Properly - Room 42'S Bathroom Window Has Draughts.,,,,,
,1693,None For How Short Of A Stay We Had.,,,,,
,1699,We Accidentally Left Bathroom Light On One Evening. Be Greener To Have Electronic Room Key So All Electrics Go Out When You Leave The Room.,,,,,
,1701,No,,,,,
,1702,Nothing To Add - Just A Great Experience And I Hope We Will Both Have The Opportunity To Do It All Again!,,,,,
,1704,It May Be Possible To Reduce The Amount Of Laundry By Finding A Suitable Hand Drying Replacement / Alternative To The Individual Hand Towels Provided In The Toilets (Not A Criticism Because It Was A Very Nice Touch!),,,,,
,1706,Not Sure How You Water The Golf Course  But Collecting Rain Water In Ponds/Reservoirs Hidden Amongst The Tree-Covered (I.E. Out-Of-Sight) Areas Would Help And Might Save On Water Bills In The Long Run  Albeit Being Costly To Set Up.,,,,,
,1708,You Could Harness The River To Power A Micro-Generator & Possibly Put In A Disguised Wind-Turbine In The Valley.,,,,,
,1710,None-You Seemed Well On Top Of This,,,,,
,1711,Don't Change Towells Every Day. Housekeeping Staff Should Not Put The Dishwasher On When There Is Very Little In It. We Had One Occurrence Where They Put It On When There Was 1 Glass In It!! All Of The Heating/Radiators Seem To Be On Full  The Heat Was Stifling When Got In.,,,,,
,1714,None,,,,,
,1720,More Obvious Recycling Available?  Encourage To Switch Off Lights Etc,,,,,
,1723,None,,,,,
,1725,I Think You May Need A New Shed To Facilitate Some Of The Golf Buggies Left Outside  Some Of Them Were Starting To Look Pretty Green!!  ;),,,,,
,1726,To Be Honest I Didn't Even Look For It. On The Other Hand I Wasn't Informed Either So That Might Be A Good First Step. Do You Have A Sustainable Charter By Any Chance?,,,,,
,1727,How About Making A Vegetable Garden In The Grounds And Using Your Own Produce ? Also It Would Be Nice To See On The Menus Where Food Is Sourced From So That You Can See What Produce Is Local To Devon.,,,,,
,1728,Start To Use Led Lamps In Areas That Are Lit For Long Periods Of Time. Your Energy Bills Would Reduce Vastly.,,,,,
,1737,Use Local Food Produce  Less Air Miles.,,,,,
,1742,Less Plastic Water Bottles,,,,,
,1748,Fine  Don't Overdo It!,,,,,
,1750,Ask Guests To Be Economical With Their Use On Towels As Other Hotels Do.,,,,,
,1755,Turn Off The Lights. It Was Like A Lighting Studio When We Were Shown Our Room.  No Need!,,,,,
,1765,When Arriving At The Lodge The Fire Was Alight  A Lovely Experience However It Was September And Still Very Warm - We Had To Open The Door To Cool The Room Down,,,,,
,1767,I Don't Know Your Business Well Enough To Answer This Question.,,,,,
,1777,Maybe Make Guests( In The Lodges) Aware Of Your Recycling Policy And What Rubbish Goes In What Bins?,,,,,
,1778,Ask If The Guese Requires A Recipt Before Being Given One,,,,,
,1780,No,,,,,
,1784,Not My Bag I'm Afraid - I'm Sure You've Already Consulted A Firm Who Specialise In This Area!,,,,,
,1788,No,,,,,
,1789,Supply Golf Balls That Impossible To Lose.,,,,,
,1792,Everything Possible Seems To Be In Place.,,,,,
,1800,The Hotel Provides A Very Positive Addition To The Environment. Don't Let The Bureaucrats Change This,,,,,
,1802,All Appeared Enviromentally Friendly And Was Very Much Noticable,,,,,
,1805,No,,,,,
,1807,No,,,,,
,1809,Sensor Controlled Lighting. Showers Only. Large  Refillable Product Supplies. Real Milk Available As Opposed To Individual Containers  It Could Be In Vacuum Jugs In Areas In The Corridors.,,,,,
,1814,The Use Of Robes In The Spa Could Possibly Reduce On The Number Of Towels Being Used.,,,,,
,1819,Perhaps A Bathroom Hand Drier As Opposed To Individual Linen Handtowels,,,,,
,1820,I  Am Sure You Are Already Scrutinising All Areas Although Mr Rata's Flatulence Needs Looking At-Bovey Is In Danger Of Becoming A Rural Methane Island,,,,,
,1826,I Was Unaware Of Any Lack On The 'Green' Side. There Was No Evidence Of Any Anything That Would Have Made Me Think About It.,,,,,
,1832,Although Drying Ones Hands On An Individual Flannel Is Lovely - Paper Towels Would Be Greener - Or Even  Dyson Hi Speed Air Dryers Would Be  Greener. No Criticism Really We Loved The Flannels!!!,,,,,
,1834,No,,,,,
,1836,Unfortunately Not .,,,,,
,1837,The Hotel Was Over Heated. Better Heat Control For The Bedrooms Would Have Prevented Us From Having To Open The Windows Overnight.,,,,,
,1840,It Would Be Hoped That You Already Re Cycle As Much As You Can.,,,,,
,1842,Turn The Heating Down !,,,,,
,1843,Cant Think Of Anything.,,,,,
,1847,The Towel Scheme Whereby People Place Their Towels In The Bath If They Want Them Changing Or Hang Them Up If They Are Happy To Keep Them For Another Day.,,,,,
,1848,Our Towels Were Changed Every Day Sometimes Twice Even When We've Hung Them Up.  It Maybe An Idea To Ask Guests To Put In The Bath What They'd Like To Have Changed Instead Of Just Systematically Changing Everything ?,,,,,
,1850,Could Replace Standard Kettles With The Energy Efficient Ones That Heat The Water As It Is Delivered.,,,,,
,1852,Recycling At The Lodges,,,,,
,1856,My Line Of Work Is With The Railways  So If You Ever Want A Special Train (Steam Or Diesel Hauled) Organised To Deliver A Party Of Up To 300 Guests By Train To Bovey Tracey (The Branch Line From Newton Abbot Is Still In Place And We've Been Involved In Getting It Reactivated)  Let Me Know (07736 872582  Nick@Intermodality.Com). Might Be Of Interest To The Americans Or Russians  Their Own Private Train From London?,,,,,
,1859,Although The Individual Towels In The Ladies Were Lovely  This Must Have An Impact.,,,,,
,1862,Towels Don't Need To Be Changed Everyday.,,,,,
,1867,I Didnt See A Lot Of Waste So I Think Your Doing A Great Job.,,,,,
,1868,Maybe Signs So That You Can Reuse Your Towels   Rather Than Be Replaced Daily.,,,,,
,1870,There Is Nothing We Can Think Of,,,,,
,1872,I Don't Think The Removal Of The Individual Towels In Cloackrooms Would Detract From The Experience.,,,,,
,1873,There Didn't Appear To Be Any Notice In The Bathroom With Regard To Clean Towels. It Is Not Necessary To Change Towels Daily And At Other Hotels We Have Been To There Is Usually A Sign To Say Put Dirty Towels In The Bath If You Want Them Changed.  This Seems To Work Quite Well And Would Save On The Environment A Little.,,,,,
,1874,Turn Down Your Thermostat. Get A Waste Food Processing Machine. You Can Use The Pellets On The Garden. Nymans Garden Has One And I'm Sure They Can Provide You With Some Useful Information. Why Not Run Some Courses On Eco Awareness For Home Owners. Set Yourself Up As A Centre Of Excellence In Green Business Sense.,,,,,
,1877,Recycling The Bottles Which Hold The Room's Bottled Water.,,,,,
,1879,N/A,,,,,
,1880,None That We Can Think Of,,,,,
,1885,Not At The Minute,,,,,
,1889,Being Certified To Iso 14001 Would Publicly Confirm Your Environmental Committment / Credentials.  As A Certification Auditor  I'd Recommend It !!,,,,,
,1891,Hope The Glass Water Bottles Are Recycled,,,,,
,1895,Lot Of Paperwork On Heavy High Quality Paper E.G.  Final Bill Could Offer To Email It To The Guest To Save Paper.,,,,,
,1898,The Hotel Was Very Hot And Although It Was A Cold Weekend The Temperatures Were Excessively High The Window In Our Bedroom Was Poorly Fitting And Draughty So Much Heat Is Probably Lost In This Way,,,,,
,1899,The Room Was Very Hot - Could The Heating Be Turned Down Or Controllable By A Thermostat In The Room? We Didn't Use Our Towels As We Showered At The Pool In The Morning And Evening - How Could That Be Indicated To Housekeeping?,,,,,
,1900,Suggest That Some Guests Consider Leaving Their Chelsea Tractors At Home!!!!!!!!!!!,,,,,

,2038,It Wasn't Obvious In The Lodges That Re Cycling Was Taking Place With The Rubbish! Some Means Of Separation Could Be Introduced Perhaps.,,,,,
,2040,Furtherr Provision Of Dog Poo Bins!,,,,,
,2043,Use Led Lights In Downlights,,,,,
,2046,Yes - I Think You Can Simplify Your Bills - There Was An Awful Not Of Paper,,,,,
,2048,Ask Whether Guests Want Their Towels Changed Every Day. Turn The Heating Down In The Dining Room  It Was Unbearably Hot!,,,,,
,2059,No,,,,,
,2063,Very Little. However On One Hand It Is Terrific To Spend Time In A Lovely Warm Hotel But I Think Some Areas Are A Bit On The High Side Which Might Benefit From A Few Degrees Lower ,,,,,
,2064,Maybe There Should Be A Sign At The Entrance Giving Improved Details That You Are A First Class Hotel.,,,,,
,2067,Yes We Have Been Looking For Sustainably Sourced Fish And We Saw That There Is Local And Line Caught Fish On Teh Menu So That's Very Good. We Are Happy To Reuse Our Towels In The Room So Any Advice On That We Would Have Followed. We Work In Renewables And We Thought That The Castle Might Benefit Strongly From Having A Biomass Boiler - Would Cut Heating/Power Cost Down And Good For Green Credentials Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,2068,No,,,,,
,2072,I Led There At 4Am (In A Very Comfy Bed) Trying To Work Out How Much Your Heating Bills Would Be! Off The Top Off My Head I Came Out With 200K  Because Our Room Was Positively Roasting! I Guess You Can't Compensate All The Mod Cons/ Insulation Of A New Property For The Original Character Bovey Castle Has. Maybe A Designated Family Area? And A Rope/Adventure Centre For Children? It Works Well At The Celtic Manor Resort. We Also Have Polo Events. We Stay At Many 5* Hotels Around The World And I Still Think Valet Parking Should Only Be An Option........ I Could Go On! But My Opinions Are Just That And Not Fact.,,,,,
,2076,Choice Of Different Sized Towels In The Bathroom. I Had Two Large Towels. A Hand Towel And Bath Sheet Would Have Been Better  And For One Night Could Have Cut Down On Washing Two Large Towels. A Lot Of Toast Seemed To Have Been Wasted At Breakfast; Perhaps Staff Could Ask How Many Slices Are Required As This Would Prevent So Much Wastage. Most Other Things Seem To Have Already Been Thought Of  No Other Suggestions Spring To Mind As It Seems Most Things Have Already Been Thought Of,,,,,
,2084,- Don't Use Minature Bathroom Products. Keep A Basket Of Large Size  High Quality Products In The Bathroom (Like Babington House Do) And Refill Accordingly. The Amount You Lose To People Taking Home Will Be Far Less Than The Amount You Currently Spend To ,,,,,
,2086,Get Rid Of The Individual Hand Towels  You'd Safe Water And Detergent Which Pollutes Rivers,,,,,
,2089,Electric Cars Instead Of Diesel Cars Or Carts.,,,,,
,2096,Solar Panels On That Roof! Seemed To Be Masses Of Towels Everywhere. We Didn't Use All Of Ours And I Wondered If They Would Still Be Washed!,,,,,
,2101,Reduce Number Of Towels Fractionally! But Only Fractionally!,,,,,
,2102,You Are Green. I Don't Know A Greener Place.,,,,,
,2103,Instead Of Having Small Disposable Shampoo/Conditioner/Lotion Bottles  Have Large Bottles That Multiple Guests Use.  Thanks!,,,,,
,2105,Bathroom Accessories Ie Shower Soap/Shampoo Fixed Bottle Refills Instead Of Present System Where Product Is Not Always Used 100% Then Thrown Way.,,,,,
,2106,Less Paperwork At Checkout Turn Heating Down - We Had To Keep The Windows Open To Maintain A Comfortable Temperature.,,,,,
,2109,Perhaps To Turn Down The Heating And Close The Doors On The Ground Floor. Room No 8 Was Hot At Night.,,,,,
,2112,Not Change The Towels  Flannels Etc In The Evening If Guests Staying Only One Night.  Or Ask Guests To Put Towels Etc On The Bathroom Floor That Need Exchanging.,,,,,
,2113,Maybe Include Recycling Bins In The Lodges?,,,,,
,2114,More Candles As This Would Lend It's Self To The Castle Atmos! Could The River Be Used To Generate Power? Site Vehicles To Run On The Waste Oil Generated By The Kitchens?,,,,,
,2122,We Were Wondering How You Kept The Place So Warm And Costs Involved.Oil Or Renewables Via Pellet Burner Ground Or Air Heat Exchangers.,,,,,
,2125,No.,,,,,
,2130,Provide Recycling Facilities In The Room For Papers  Bottles Etc. (Unless It Is Sorted By The Hotel). You Could Provide A Copy Of The Bill On The Monitor In The Room And Send A Soft Copy Of The Bill By Email Instead Of Printing It On Departure.,,,,,
,2131,No - My Experiences In Eco-Hotels Have Not Been Happy.,,,,,
,2132,Not Really,,,,,
,2136,N/A,,,,,
,2140,Introduce A Kitchen Garden And Use The Produce In The Restaurants. Turn The Heat Down When It's Mild - We Had To Open Our Windows In Order To Let The Heat Out It Was So Warm In Our Bedroom - Not An Efficient Use Of Fuel.,,,,,
,2144,No,,,,,
,2146,Tongue In Cheek - Rose Cottage Could Have A Personalized Golf Buggy To Avoid The Need To Use A Car To Go To The Hotel To Use The Spa Facilities..........,,,,,
,2147,It Must Cost A Fortune To Heat And Provide Hot Water. Have You Looked Into Installing Your Own Microgeneration Eg Solar  Wind Turbine Or Biomass?,,,,,
,2151,I Liked The Introduction Of Recycling Bins. Mind You The Labels Were Hidden By The Blue Plastic Bags Lining The Bins!,,,,,
,2153,Recycling Was Not As Easy As Perhaps Could Be  Maybe More Bins In Kitchen / Outside For This Purpose And Clearer Instructions On Disposal Of Items.,,,,,
,2157,Don't Change Your Discoveries For Mercedes!,,,,,
,2158,Do You Recycle The Glass Bottles From The Complimentary Water? (Greatly Appreciated),,,,,
,2160,No,,,,,
,2162,Maybe Dyson Hand Driers In Loos?,,,,,
,2163,No,,,,,
,2166,Not As Such - We Aren't Greenies  But We Do Advise You To Avoid Wind Turbines Of Any Size - Futile And Not 'Green'  Nor To Cover Your Land In Solar Panels.  The Peaceful Beauty Of The Landscape Around You Is Your Great Asset.,,,,,
,2167,No Ideas I'm Afraid!,,,,,
,2176,Don't Lose Your Easiness About That,,,,,
,2177,Turn Down The Heating! All Of The Roooms Including The Dining Rooms Were Far Too Hot.,,,,,
,2181,The Heating In The Rooms Could Be On A Thermostat During The Night. It Was Very Hot In The Stairwell Next To The Lift. The Temperature Could Be Reduced.,,,,,
,2182,You Have Your Own Chickens ...Great Eggs! Your Videos On The Web Site Are Great - They Should Be More Prominent They Get The Ambience Just Right,,,,,
,2186,Instead Of There Being Just One Refuse Bin In The Lodge  There Would Have Been Room For A Recylce Box Comprising Of Two Or Three Compartments  I.E. For Glass  Paper  Etc.,,,,,
,2190,Put The Heating On Well Before Checking Into The Room.  It Was Very Cold  And Did Not Heat Sufficiently. The Radiator In The Bathroom Did Not Work And  When I Complained  A Portable Heater Was Brought. On My 3Rd Complaint We Were Moved.  The New Room Was Good.,,,,,
,2192,Solar Technology For Heating.,,,,,
,2195,A Small Card With A 'Gentle Reminder' In The Bathroom On Water Wastage By Not Leaving Taps Running Overlong On Teeth Brushing Etc. You Might Have A 'Shuttle/Mini Bus' Available To Nearby Places So Visitors Do Not Overuse Their Vehicles.,,,,,
,2202,There Again You Seem To Have Thought Of Everything. It Was Quiet While We Were There And Consequently Fewer Fires Were Lit And Heating Down In Unused Room.It Can't Be Easy To Be Prepared For All Situations Unexpected Guests Etc But It Appears That Everything That Could Be Done Was Done.,,,,,
,2205,Ensure That You Recycle Most Of The Waste Created At Bovey.  Garden Waste  Food Waste  Plastics  Glass  Tin  Paper/Card  Textiles  Batteries Etc.,,,,,
,2208,Yes Close Down,,,,,
,2215,The Use Of Water From The River Is A Great Idea.  All Of The Lights Were On In The Room When We Arrived- And Presumably Had Been On Since Being Vacated Earlier That Day (We Arrived In The Middle Of The Day And The Rooms Are Lovely And Bright So Really No Need!),,,,,
,2228,I Presume The Glass Bottles Of Drinking Water In The Rooms Get Recycled Otherwise That Is An Option.  Similar For The Plastic Bottles Of Shower Things In The Rooms. Perhaps Not Having The Tv On As A Sort Of Screen Saver? We Didn't Check But Energy Efficient Bulbs?,,,,,
,2229,Extra Glazing On Windows Particularly In The Roof Rooms And Turn Your Heating Down A Notch We Were So Hot In Your Hotel,,,,,
,2236,None That I Can Think Of.,,,,,
,2241,No,,,,,
,2242,Bio-Digestors For The Disposal Of Effluent.,,,,,
,2245,Use Less Heat  - We Needed The Windows Open In The Bedroom For Comfort. Use Less Paper At Checkout,,,,,
,2247,No  But I Would Encourage Air Conditioning In The Rooms.,,,,,
,2248,Solar Panels And Perhaps Heat Pumps .Perhaps Double Glazing And Better Controls On Heating In The Bedrooms .Always A Difficult One But Maybe Drop The Pool Heating Down A Degree Or Two?,,,,,
,2252,No. You Seem To Be Doing Pretty Well.,,,,,
,2260,No There Wasn't Anything Obvious That Stood Out. I Think These Days People Are Very 'Green Aware' And If There Were Any Concerns You'd Be Aware By Now.,,,,,
,2274,Only Replace The Towels In They Are Placed In The Bath,,,,,
,2284,None,,,,,
,2288,Perhaps A Note In The Bathrooms To Leave Towels You Want Changing In The Bath Tub And Keep Those You Dont Mind Using Again On The Towel Rail.,,,,,
,2293,Make Recycling Easier In The Lodges (Have A Bin For Items Similar To The Green Compost Bin But Larger).,,,,,
,2301,No.,,,,,
,2303,Too Many Lights On.,,,,,
,2316,Turn The Thermostats Down In The Lodges. The Water Is Constantly At Scalding Temperature And Far Too Hot.,,,,,
,2320,No We Think You Are Generally Doing A Great Job,,,,,
,2326,Turn The Heating Down In The Pool Area.,,,,,
,2338,Sell The Business To A Company That Knows How To Run A Luxury Establishment Properly. You Seem To Worry More About How The Reception Staff Look Rather Than Guest Comfort.,,,,,
,2340,None Springs To Mind,,,,,
,2348,No,,,,,
,2349,At Least 150Mm Of Insulation In The Roof Void.  Turn Down The Heating - Particularly At Night.  Perhaps Use Room Thermostats.  Use Timber Fires Not Gas.  It Seemed That Only One Open Fire Used Logs And That Was Not In Operation.,,,,,
,2351,Its A Luxury Venue .. So We Use More Towels Then At Home ..Well That's What A Treat Is All About.  I Am Sure Though As In Most Hotels If You Want The Towels Changed They Are Left In The Bath  Any Left On A Rail Can Be Reused I Am Sure Most People Accept That These Days.,,,,,
,2355,Turn The Heating Down! (But Not Too Much.),,,,,
,2362,Do You Use Rainwater For Flushing Toilets? Also Lights Could Come On Entering Toilet Facilities.  Solar Panels For Hot Water Supply. Check Out Enviroment Agency Website For Guidance!,,,,,
,2364,A Volvo S60 Hybrid Availble For Hire / Pick Up From Rail Station Etc.!!,,,,,
,2365,Nothing That Springs To Mind.,,,,,
,2366,Appropriately Placed Recycling Bins For Paper/Bottles/Cans,,,,,
,2367,No,,,,,
,2371,The Heat Was So High We Had To Open The Windows To Cool The Lodge Down.,,,,,
,2372,No,,,,,
,2383,Please Inform Guests At The Lodges How To Recycle Bottles Etc. We Threw A Lot More In The Bin Than We Would Have Done At Home.,,,,,
,2387,There Were No Recycling Boxes In Our Lodge.  The Lodge Was Very Warm - Almost Excessively So. This Could Be Reduced Considerably Without Compromising Comfort. The Temperature In The Utility Room Which Housed The Tank Etc Was Unbearable.,,,,,
,2390,No,,,,,
,2401,No Printable Comment! You Are Trying To Be Trendy And It Doesn't Suit. Please Don't Go There.,,,,,
,2404,Have You Considered The Bathroom Towels Being Reused Not Changed Every Day?  Some Hotels We Have Stayed In Have A Notice About Placing Your Towels On The Rail If You Wish To Use Them Again. Put Them On The Floor When You Need Them Changing.... Plus It Cuts Laundry Costs.,,,,,
,2407,Please See Comments On Heating In Rooms,,,,,
,2409,Notice To Guests That Towels Left On The Rail Means They Can Be Re-Used  Left In The Bath For Washing To Help Minimise Laundering (If There Was One Then It Wasn't Apparent In Our Room),,,,,
,2410,Maybe More Recycling - We Would Have Sorted Bottles/Papers Etc Happily If There Had Been Facilities To Do This,,,,,
,2411,Use Tap Water In Rooms.,,,,,
,2412,Solar Panels With The Government Feed In Tarriff  - If Not Already Considered. If Applicable.  I Personally Welcome The Convention Of Not Exchanging Towels Daily Be Default  In The Interest Of Care For The Environment  But Think I Prefer A Notice Displayed That Advises This Is The Case And What Guests Should Do To Indicate Whether Clean Towels Are Required Or Not. In The Absence Of Any Information About When Towels Would Be Changed (That I Am Aware Of) I Left A Note To Advise Room Servicing Personnel That No Replacement Was Required For 2Nd Day Stay.,,,,,
,2418,I Work On This Topic Professionally Yet Couldn't Offer You Much Advice As Your Biggest Environmental Hit Has To Be The Energy You Pump In To Heat The Property - And There's Little You Can Do About Further Insultation Without Damaging The Looks/Character Of The Main Property...,,,,,
,2419,Fix The Radiator Thermostatic Valves In The Bedrooms,,,,,
,2420,I Am Not An Enviromentalist So Green Issues Do Not Concern Me I Like My Towels Changed Every Day,,,,,
,2421,No,,,,,
,2422,None That I Can Think Of.,,,,,
,2429,Unused Towels Should Not Be Changed,,,,,
,2432,Not Really!,,,,,
,2433,We Stayed In One Of The Exclusive Holiday Lodges And With Full Occupancy Could Have Benefitted From Someone To Call Dauly To Empty Bins. We Could Not Find Instructions Where To Dispose Of Full Bin Bags.,,,,,
,2435,Not Really  If The Guests Do Not Co-Operate It Is Not Going To Happen.,,,,,
,2437,For An Older Style Building It Really Can't Be Easy And I Am Sure You Have Done Everything You Can Plus You Have Such Glorious Grounds - Not Masses Of Concrete Everywhere.,,,,,
,2443,Use Electric Buggies To Ferry People Around Instead Of Showing People To Their Lodges Using Range Rovers.,,,,,
,2444,Notices In The Bathrooms Advising Guests To Place Their Towels On The Floor Only If They Require Fresh Ones  Would Aid Environmental Concerns.,,,,,
,2445,In Lodges Ask Guests To Turn Off Gas Fire If They Are Going Out. You Could Use Health And Safety Angle But We Felt That Must Eat Up Gas.,,,,,
,2449,More Low Energy Light Bulbs  Reduce Heat In The Hotel. Our Own House Is Never Nearly Anything Like As Warm And We Found The Hotel Too Hot Generally.,,,,,
,2451,Numerous Lights Left On Despite Sun Shining Through The Windows.,,,,,
,2454,No Comments At This Time.,,,,,
,2455,Perhaps A Discreet Bank Of Solar Panels Located Clear Of The Main Building Could Reduce Energy Consumption And Consequently Reduce Carbon Footprint.,,,,,
,2460,Only Change Towels If Guests Reqest It.,,,,,
,2462,No  Sorry.,,,,,
,2471,We Could Do With Some More Dog Bins In The Grounds And Have Them Emptied More Regularly.,,,,,
,2499,Indoor Tennis Court  Lawn Bowl Green,,,,,
,2504,Offer Tap Water Bottled By The Bedside Rather Than Bottled Water.,,,,,
,2510,Upload The Weather Reports Onto The Tv Screen Rather Than Print On Paper.,,,,,
,2515,Not Changing Towels Every Day / Night.  Put A 'Request A Towel Change' Card On The Door (Many Hotels Now Do This).,,,,,
,2519,More Recycling.,,,,,
,2521,No,,,,,
,2533,Biomass Boiler!,,,,,
,2535,Maybe One Thing  Nothing Major But I Noticed In The Ground Floor Male Bathroom  Instead Of Hand Towels  Maybe A Couple Of Dyson Hand Dryers Would Minimise The Need To Wash And Dry So Many Towels. Although The Hand Dryers May Create Some Noise Pollution The New Series Of Hand Dryers Are More Quiter.,,,,,
,2551,Turn The Heat Down In The Corridors!,,,,,
,2554,Looked Fine To Me,,,,,
,2557,You Are Doing A Great Job And Should Be Awarded For Your Progressive  Positive Attitude,,,,,
,2559,No,,,,,
,2560,Don't Remove Tablet Of Soap After First Day!,,,,,
,2564,No,,,,,
,2568,You Could Perhaps Provide The Lodges With Waste Food Bins  So That It May Be Composted Rather Than Having To Be Put In With The General Waste.,,,,,
,2570,No,,,,,
,2572,Regulate The Heating To A Slightly Lower Mean Point.,,,,,
,2575,Cannot Think Of Anything,,,,,
,2579,No,,,,,
,2581,You Have Done Extremely Well!!!!!!,,,,,
,2593,No,,,,,
,2594,Such A Detail Was Not On Our Radar On This Occasion.,,,,,
,2596,Nope.,,,,,
,2603,Fine As It Is.,,,,,
,2611,Switch  Off The Air Conditioning Between 11 P.M. And 5 A.M. It Was Blowing With Some Noise Just Beneath Our Window,,,,,
,2613,I Must Have Had 3 Paper Accounts. I Said It Was Not Necessary But Was Told That Was How It Worked,,,,,
,2614,No Areas Noted Where Improvements Could Be Made. I Would Recommend Obtaining Iso14001 If You Haven't Already Achieved This Environmental Qualification.,,,,,
,2616,Whilst Staying At The Hotel In March We Had Reason To Request The Room Be Heated.This Resulted In Two Electric Fires Being Brought To The Room. Surely The Heating System Should Be Able To Service The Room As Required Rather Than Use Electric Fires And The Direct Energy Use. If Others In The Hotel Also Needed Heat In Their Rooms Think Of The Total Energy And Co2 Creation?,,,,,
,2618,Graze Cattle And Sheep On The Golf Course?,,,,,
,2621,No,,,,,
,2623,No,,,,,
,2626,Install Separate Room Heating Controls. I Found It At Times To Be Too Hot,,,,,
,2627,I Noticed That There Was No Attempt To Recycle Our Refuse From The Lodge.   Do You Have Any Thoughts On How This Could Be Achieved?,,,,,
,2632,No  That Was All Perfect,,,,,
,2635,Turn The Heating Down! Cannot Understand Why English Hotels Overheat  And Use Excess Energy Unnecessarily,,,,,
,2637,You Have The Ponds  Look At Castle Howard System Of Ground Heat Sourcing From Beneath Their Lake. This Has Made Them Carbon Neutral And And Reduced Their Costs By A Huge Amount.,,,,,
,2640,No,,,,,
,2642,Not Really,,,,,
,2648,On The Contrary  We Loved The Absence Of Those Silly Notices So Common In Hotels Imploring Us To Save Our Towels.,,,,,
,2662,Sorry  No.,,,,,
,2664,I Appreciate Your Concern Here And Share It With You. Recycle Plastic And Glass Bottles Comes To Mind. Have Recycling Centers Where Guests Could Deposit These Items?,,,,,
,2668,The Thing I Thought Was Odd  Was That In The Pool Area There Was No Help For Disabled Guests  Most Hotels Etc.  Have A Chair That Can Be Lowered Into The Pool For Them To Use.,,,,,
,2670,Changing Of Bed Sheets And Towels: We Did Not See Any Notice In The The Room (Maybe We Missed It) To Choose As To Whether Bedding Etc To Be Changed. In Our Case  There Was Definitely No Need To Change It Every Day. Breakfast: Also  No Real Need To Change The Table Cloth Every Time. Just Provide Some Sourcers For Tea And Coffee And That Will Keep It Clean Much Longer  Without Objections From Guests.,,,,,
,2672,The Steam Room And Sauna In The Swimmingpool Were On From Early Morning Using A Huge Amount Of Power. Perhaps A User-Settable Time Switch Might Be Considered.,,,,,
,2682,It Is Apparant That All Is Being Done To Maintain Enviromental Standings And Was Noticed,,,,,
,2689,Youare Being Sensible. I Wouldn't Go Overboard!,,,,,
,2695,Don't Keep Changing The Towels When Guests Put Them Back On The Heated Towel Rails Themselves. Think Again About Charging Such A High Service Charge Because It Seems Insulting To Staff To Remove It And Leaves Guests With A Bitter Taste.  I Have Stayed At Both The Savoy In London And Cliveden In Berkshire Since August And Neither Seek To Do The Same. Learn From The Others ...  It's Enough To Put Me Off Coming Back!,,,,,
,2711,The Hotal Was Far Too Hot. You Could Save A Lot Of Energy By Turning Down The Heating,,,,,
,2718,Have You Any Scope For Hydro Electric From Your Rivers ?,,,,,
,2720,There Appears To Be Only The One Waste Bin In The Kitchen Of The Lodge And Perhaps The Staff Sort The Bottles From The Refuse  But Perhaps It Would Be Friendlier To The Environment If There Was An 'Eco' Type Disposal System For Bottles  Refuse  Paper  Foodstuffs?,,,,,
,2727,Don't Drive Carts And Other Vehicles So Fast All Over The Grounds!!!,,,,,
,2730,Provision Of Numerous Small Bottls In The Bathroom Is Still Common In Many High Quality Hotels But It Extremely Wasteful. Large Dispensers Of Shampoo Etc May Not Feel 'Posh' Enough But Are Perfectly Acceptable. Do You Ask Guests If They Will Re-Use Sheets And Towels? I Don't Think We Were Given A Choice.,,,,,
,2737,Don't Know,,,,,
,2741,Told When Asked To Put Glass  Cardboard  Plastic And Paper In General Bin,,,,,
,2744,Improve Ventilation In Rooms So Guests Don't Need To Use Fans Use Local Ingredients .,,,,,
,2754,Maybe Ask If Guests Want Invoice Printed Or Emailed. Or Printed On Recycled Paper.,,,,,
,2761,Train The Breakfast Staff To Bring The Tea  Coffee And Toast Out When Its Hot  So It Doesn't Need To Be Thrown Away And Re-Made  Therefore Saving Energy.,,,,,
,2809,Thoughtr The Grounds Were Absolutely Manicured And Hotel Itself Extremely Clean And Pristine Could Possibly Improve Bathrooms Found Them Rather Bare And Old Fashioned,,,,,
,2817,It Will Always Be Very Difficult To Maintain The Character Of Such An Old Building And Make It Eco Friendly. The Demand On The Heating  Particularly In Cold Weather  Will Always Be Great. You Would Be Best To Do All Possible To Insulate As Much As Possible And Reduce Heat Loss  Rather Than Spend On Fashionable And Visible But Less Efficient Schemes. But Celebrate And Broadcast Your Successes.,,,,,
,2827,Perhaps You Could Ask That Guests Request Bed And Towel Changes Rather Than Doing It As A Matter Of Course. I Would Not Mind Reusing Sheets And Towels During A 2 Night Break.,,,,,
,2841,Reinstating Log Fires In Public Lounges/ Library.,,,,,
,2848,Make Recycling Easier - Would Have Been Happy To Sort Bottled/Papers Etc For Recycling  But Just 1 Small Composting Bin.,,,,,
,2860,Recycle Waste From Lodges. When Asked We Were Told Paper  Cardboard   Plastic And Glass All Had To Be But In The Ordinary Bin,,,,,
,2866,Notice For Customers Who Do Not Want Their Towels Laundered: E.G. 'Please Leave Your Towels On The Bathroom Floor If You Wish To Have Them Changed'.  It Can Be Prefixed With A Statement On The Effect To The Environment Of Waste Products Of Laundering...Just A Thought!,,,,,
,2956,Maybe Use Electric Vehciles As Shuttle Cars?,,,,,
,2974,Notices In The Bathroom To Ask Whether Clean Towels Are Needed Or Not  Would Be Useful.,,,,,
,3057,Have A Note For Towels - Do Not Need A Change.,,,,,
,3065,We Were Very Pleased To See That You Now Provide Recycling Bins In The Cottage.....Perhaps You Could Include Tins/Aluminium And Also Perhaps Rose Cottage And The Lodges Could Have An Outside Composter...,,,,,
,3107,Please Make Sure The Bins In The Lodges Are Labelled So That We Know Where To Put Different Types Of Rubbish  There Was No Indication On The Four Bins This Time So No Idea What Went Where With What.,,,,,
,3325,Provide Recycling Bins/Instructions,,,,,
,3709,Make Sure You Use Fewer Glass Bottles By Placing All Wine In Ready To Drink Containers  Preferably On My Table....,,,,,
,3714,It Seems That Much Food Is Wasted For Example There Are 6 Slices Of Bread For 2 People. Maybe You Ask The Guests How Many They Want.,,,,,
,3716,Solar Heat The Pool.,,,,,
,3717,No.,,,,,
,3730,Cook Breakfast To Order As There Must Be A Staggering Amount Of Food Thrown Away.  We Came For Breakfast Late Both Days And The Volume Of Food Was Very High For The Numbers Of People.  I Would Have Thought That This Would Also Decrease Overall Costs Per Person.,,,,,
,3740,It May Be A Good Environmental Investment To Build Solar Panels Or Wind Turbines To Generate At Least Part Of Your Electricity. I Understand It May Spoil The Look Of Your Estate  But If It Was Built Away And Brought In Using Cables That May Not Be A Problem. During My Stay It Seemed To Be Both Pretty Windy And Sunny Compared To Leeds Where I Live (Not Sure If It's Normal) And Installing E.G. A Series Of Wind Turbines On Top Of Dartmoor Where The Wind Should Be Strongest May Significantly Both Help The Environment As Well As Reduce Future Energy Bills. Other Way Of Saving The Environment Would Be Making Guests Put Towels  Bedding  Etc. On The Floor If They Want To Have Them Changed So You Don't Have To Wash All Of Them Every Day.,,,,,
,3754,Obtain Water Filtration Systems Instead Of Having Bottled Water  Bottled Water Has A Huge Carbon Footprint.,,,,,
,3760,Don't Have The Heating On Full  Save On Bills And Help The Environment. It Was A Really Warm Day And No Heating Needed To Be On At All  Yet It Was Throughout The Castle.,,,,,
,3765,Slightly Reduce The Heating In The Hotel And Room. Was A Little Uncomfortable.,,,,,
,3775,Stop Moving Our Vehicle From Space To Space!!!!  If The Valet Staff Are Bored Give Them More Work!!!,,,,,
,3778,Get An Ozone Pool.,,,,,
,3783,Lights And Tv Were Switched On When I Arrived. A Card System To Activate The Power To The Room Would Be Beneficial. Could Consider A Towel Recycling System. E.G. Towels In Bath Need Replacing  Towels On The Rack Don't. Mini Signs Could Be Placed In The Rooms For This.,,,,,
,3784,I Couldn't Tell If The Linens Were Changed During My Stay.  I Prefer To Use The Same Towels  Mats  Sheets  Etc For The Whole Stay And To Reduce The Demand For Laundry/Bleach/Water.  A Reminder Plaque To Switch Off Lights Would Also Be Helpful - So Many Hotels Have The Card Slot Circuit System That It's Hard To Remember To Switch Off Manually When I Leave The Room.,,,,,
,3794,No,,,,,
,3797,Establish A Public Transport Link So That Ecologically Minded People Without Cars Can Stay.  Rainwater Recycling System For The Toilets.  A Carefully Screened Solar Farm For The Electricity.,,,,,
,3808,Give Guests The Option To Re-Use Their Bathroom Linen. (This May Be An Option But I Didn't Notice It)?!,,,,,
,3810,Automatic Light Switches  Less Heating In The Spa Area  ..,,,,,
,3817,Utilizing Solar Energy.,,,,,
,3823,Could Use A Thermostat In The Rooms?,,,,,
,3826,Encourage Recycling In Rooms  E.G. Of The Glass Water Bottles. And Use A Greener Supplier Of Bathroom Products  E.G. Aesop.,,,,,
,3828,Policy Re Towel Use Would Be Good To Highlight,,,,,
,3831,There Could Be Shared Rides Into Areas Around Dartmoor Provided By The Hotel So Guests Are Not All Driving To Similar Places In Individual Cars.,,,,,
,3835,To Not Provide Bottled Water In The Rooms In The Evening  And When I Arrived  The Heating Was Already On In The Room Which Was A Waste Of Energy  Particularly Given That The Weather Was Very Mild...,,,,,
,3852,None Come To Mind...,,,,,
,3855,You Could Do With A Dog Waste Bin At The Back Of The Hotel.  Could Only Find One At The Front.,,,,,
,3856,Perhaps Less Paperwork Used For The Final Bill - Or The Option To Have It Emailed?,,,,,
,3863,Turning Down The Heating Esp In The Edwardian Grill.,,,,,
,3868,The Recycling Bins In Our Lodge Were Great But We Were Not Entirely Sure Where To Put What!  A Little Sign Would Be Useful.,,,,,
,3872,Newly Built Cottage Have Some Good Roof Orientation For Solar Panels. On Heating Side A Biomass System Could Provide Great Value.   Some Of The Bulbs Permanently On Should Definitely Be Energy Savers  If Not All!!  Missed The Obvious Hotel Towel Suggestion  Don't Know If All Were Replaced Each Time?,,,,,
,3873,Turn The Heating Down Around The Swimming Pool It Was Nearly Unbearable It Was So Hot.,,,,,
,3878,Towels Were All Changed After One Day - We Were Only There For 2 So Was Completely Unnecessary,,,,,
,3880,Stop Operating - Everything Would Be Better Off,,,,,
,3887,Instructions On What Could Be Recycled In The Lodge ( There Was A Recycling Bin But We Weren't Clear On What To Put In It!),,,,,
,3900,Turn The Heating Down!,,,,,
,3901,The Rooms Were Very Hot And Although Lovely To Feel Warm And Cosy It Is Perhaps Not Necessary To Heat The Rooms So That Windows Have To Be Left Open.,,,,,
,3903,The Soap Bar In The Bathroom Does Not Need To Be Replaced Daily. Also  Towels Can Be Re-Used So An Option For This Should Be Offered.,,,,,
,3909,Do Not Spoil Any Of The Character Of The Place By Pandering Unnecessarily To So Called Environmental Impact. It's A Big Old Building  With Single Glazing  Open Fires And A Jaguar Car Fleet  There's Only So Much That Could Be Done. Led Bulbs In The 1St Floor Ceiling Lamp Outside The Spa Will Do Very Little To Help. If Any Customers Feel Strongly  They Should Perhaps Stay In A Yurt On The Moors  Rather Than A Country House Hotel.  Wind The Heating Up  Put More Logs On The Fire  And Explain To Anyone That Grizzles  That You Have Battery Carts To The Lodges !,,,,,
,3915,Burn Seasoned Wood!,,,,,
,3922,Recycling Containers In The Lodges,,,,,
,3924,No.,,,,,
,3937,Hand Driers In The Toilets,,,,,
,3941,Clearly Marked Recycling Bins In Lodges.,,,,,
,3951,This Is Not Important To Me  Especially If It Detracts From The Quality Of Your Service Or Standards,,,,,
,3968,Stuff Being Green  I Dont Want To Go To A Top Hotel And Watch Everybody Mess About Watching What Impact They Are Having On The Environment. Be Sensible And Don't Cause Too Much Waste. This Green Shit Has Gone Too Far!,,,,,
,3970,Not My Area!,,,,,
,3971,No.,,,,,
,3980,The Option For Recycling In The Lodges,,,,,
,3984,An Improved Phone Signal Would Save Our Phones Having To Be Frequently Charged As They Keep Searching For A Signal.,,,,,
,3986,No Need To Wash All Towels Every Day - Give Guests The Choice As Happens In A Lot Of Other Hotels (E.G. Leave In Bath If They Need Washing  Leave On Towel Rails If Not).,,,,,
,3987,Recylcing Bins In The Bedrooms So Recyclable Rubbish Can Be Separated.,,,,,
,3990,No.,,,,,
,3994,Apart From Solar Panels On The Roof To Produce Electric(Which May Not Be Easy In The National Park !)Did Notice Fire Was Burning In The Adams Room During The Day In Summer ? Is It A Tradition ??,,,,,
,3996,How Much Lawn Chemicals Do You Use?,,,,,
,3997,No,,,,,
,3998,No,,,,,
,4000,Leave A Jug Of Water In The Room Fridges Rather Than Bottles  Offer Jugs Of Tap Water At Dinner. Have Bathroom Toiletries In Wall Dispensers Next To The Shower Rather Than Small Plastic Bottles.,,,,,
,4009,Get Beaky A Friend Or Bigger Cage! I Don't Like Caged Birds!,,,,,
,4015,More Info On Where We Could Empty Recycling Bins. Though Liked That You Had Such A Wife Selection If Them Including Food Recycling!,,,,,
,4018,Heating Abd Water On Constant In Lodges Despite Us Changing The Timer,,,,,
,4019,No,,,,,
,4023,Provide Recycling Bins For The Lodges,,,,,
,4024,No Not Really,,,,,
,4037,If You Are Worried About Wasting Food  What About An Anaerobic Digester Which Would Produce Biogas To Fuel An Electricity Generator  Or Just Straight Gas For A Boiler. Speaking Of Which The Hotel Was A Little Too Warm. We Didn't Need The Fire In The Evening And The Rooms Were Rather Hot.,,,,,
,4039,Put A Note In The Lodge Kitchens As To What Can Be Recycled  Where It Should Be Left  And What Should Go In (What We Assume Was) The Compost Box,,,,,
,4049,The Quality Of Your Paper Is Really High - And I Dont Need An Envelope - Happy If You Were To Ask If I Needed One,,,,,
,4051,Fluffier Towels. Better Insualtion On The Pool  Allowing It To Be 2-3 Degrees Warmer.,,,,,
,4062,I Wasn't Sure If The Papers And Glass Bottles We Were Putting By Our Bin Were Being Recycled.  If They Are  It Might Be Worth Putting A Little Note Somewhere (Maybe In The Room Guide).  I Also Think That Tvs Don't Need To Be Left On Stand-By...If All The Hotels In The World Turned Tvs Off And Let The Clients Take Responsibility For Turning Them On When Needed We Could Make A Huge Difference To Energy Consumption.,,,,,
,4085,I Was Pleased To See That Such A Big Hotel Still Cares About The Environment Such As Refilling Things And When We Had To Ask For More Milk We Got It In A Jug Which Was Good  Maybe More Of This Sort Of Thing But Being Careful Of Cleanliness.,,,,,
,4090,You Need To Put Uk Residents In The Restaurants Taking Your  Orders As Your In A Uk Castle !!!,,,,,
,4093,Standard Items Like Offering Guests The Option Of Keeping Towels And Sheets...Could Think About Installing Newer Toilets And Shower Heads  But A High Flow Shower Is A Nice Luxury Item!,,,,,
,4095,Heating And Fire Both On Full On Arrival  Duo Flush On The Toilets  Low Energy Light Bulbs  Recycling For Tins  Plastic Paper Etc.,,,,,
,4096,I Didn't Really Consider It During My Stay. Off The Top Of My Head I Guess Reducing The Water Rate To The Showers By 10 Percent Would Not Be Noticed But Would Provide A Substantial Cut In Water Bills. To Provide Luxury Is Not Something That Is Easy To Make Green.,,,,,
,4099,Recycling Paper For The Final Account.,,,,,
,4104,Really Impressed With Recylcling Bins In The Lodges - Only Place We've Seen This And Thought This Was Great.,,,,,
,4111,Sorry  No.,,,,,
,4115,No.,,,,,
,4124,Don't Change Towels Every Day  Unless Left In Bath Tub/On Floor.  ,,,,,
,4129,Place Signage On How To Get To Hotel So That People Don't Get Lost And Consume Too Much Fuel To Get To The Hotel,,,,,
,4140,I'm Pretty Sure Our Cleaner Changed The Towels Even Though We Had Left Them So They Did Not Need To Be Minimise Use Of Paper Towels In Public Loos Etc - Get In Some Hand Dryers (Can't Recall If The Downstairs Hand Towels Were Reusable Or Not),,,,,
,4153,None,,,,,
,4174,All Perfect  Only Problems We Had Which May Not Anwser This Particular Question Is We Had No Mobile Connection - There Was No Mobile Reception At All. We Had To Search Several Villages To Get A Proper Signal,,,,,
,4177,Install Secondary Glazing To Make The Place Warmer And Save On Energy Bills.,,,,,
,4191,The Recycling Facilities At Rose Cottage Were Unclear And Actually Did Not Give Me The Impression That Things Would Be Recycled,,,,,
,4197,Make The Recycling Facilities In The Lodge Wider And More Clearly Labeled,,,,,
,4205,The Lack Of Signal For Both Phones And Internet Are A Huge Problem To Business People. We Were Also Working During Our Stay And Found It Impossible To Connect Or Contact Our Clients / Suppliers. Whilst We Appreciate You Are In An Area Of Natural Beauty There Must Be An 'Green' Solution And Compromise To Facilitate Your Guest Needs Whilst Being Sensitive To The Environment.,,,,,
,4222,Toilet At Or Around 9Th Hole On The Golf Course.,,,,,
,4225,No,,,,,
,4228,Timed Light Movement Sensors For The Rooms In Case Guests For Get To Turn Their Lights,,,,,
,4229,No  I Think You Take Good Care Of Everything  Although It Is Wonderful To Have The Individual Flannels In The Ladies Toilets That Isn't Very Green .,,,,,
,4232,Use Smaller Cars Rather Than Gas Guzzling Land Rovers To Drive Around.,,,,,
,4236,To End On A Humourous Note  You Can Inform The Waitresses To Stop Throwing The Fresh Eggs Onto The Chairs In The Breakfast Dining Room. This Actually  Happened....An Accident Though:-),,,,,
,4241,Hmmm...You Have No Way Of Regulating The Heating In An Efficient Manner. The Radiator Either Broiled You  Or It Was Off. Then You Opened A Window To Cool Down And Hope That You Didn't Have To Start Again. There Was No Way Of Allowing Me To Have The Towels Dry Between Uses. I Am Happy To Use A Towel Until It Has Been Thrashed Or Is Soaking Wet. As They Couldn't Be Dried And Since There Wasn't A Bath  Then The 'In Or Out Of Bath' Rule Couldn't Apply. I Do Not Need Clean Sheets Every Single Day - Offer Me The Choice And I'll Happily Sleep In The Same Bed The Next Night  After It Has Been Made. The Lighting Was Controlled By Switches That Contortionists Would Struggle With And There Was One For Each. I Have No Idea How A Wheel Chair User Would Cope  But You Should Have A Master Switch For The Lot. Easier - Saves Energy. The Tv And Supporting Av Controls Would Only Go To Standby. Why No Off Option? That Would Save Energy. ,,,,,
,4244,Key Cards For Electricity In Rooms So Lights Switch Off Automatically,,,,,
,4245,My Only Complaint Which Ties In With Being Environmentally Greener Was That The Heating Was On Really High In Our Lodge. It Was Only On The Last Night That I Managed To Turn The Radiators Down. I Understand Why They Were But Don't Think Its Necessary As Its Such A Waste Of Oil Or Whichever Energy Supply You Use. I Would Put Them Much Lower So That People Can Turn Them Up If Necessary Rather Than The Other Way Round.,,,,,
,4255,Possibly Provide Reusable  Souvenir Bovey Castle Water Containers And Allow People To Refill Them From Larger Coolers As An Option Versus Smaller Plastic Water Bottles.,,,,,
,4257,Turn The Heating Down A Couple Of Degrees !,,,,,
,4260,You Could Ask Guests To Put Towels That Require Laundering In The Bath And And Allow Them To Keep Towels That Are Barely Soiled On The Rack Provided. Similarly  You Could Provide Guests With A Card To Put Out If They Do Not Require A Change Of Bed Linen. We Have Encountered This System In Several Up-Market New York Hotels And Thought It Was A Good Idea.,,,,,
,4263,Turn Off The Gas Fires In The Summer! On Cool Evenings Close Some Of The Doors At The Back. Turn Off The Lights That Illuminate Trees At Night....This Is A Shocking Waste And Also Contributes To The Light Pollution Destroying Some Of The Job Of The Moors.,,,,,
,4264,Turning Off The Heating In The Bedrooms During The Day Is A False Economy As You Then Use More Energy To Heat Up The Rooms.,,,,,
,4269,Fix The Shower Screen In Room 30 So That You Don't Have To Waste Laundry On Towels That Have Been Used To Mop The Floor!,,,,,
,4271,Recycling Trash Bins In The Room For Plastic And Newspaper Would Have Been Much Appreciated!,,,,,
,4272,Yes  The Boilers In The Lodges Are On Heat All The Time  Consider Examining More Efficent Usage.,,,,,
,4277,Label The Bins In The Lodges So It Is Clear What Can Be Recycled Locally As This Does Vary.  There Are Four Bins In The Bin Drawer But No Indication As To What Goes Where And With What For Recycling.,,,,,
,4279,The One Use Hand Towels Are Very Wasteful.Maybe Use Hand Driers?,,,,,
,4281,Turn The Heating Down In The Bedroom And The Pool Area. Both Were Too  Warm/Hot!,,,,,
,4283,None.,,,,,
,4291,You Need A Michelin Star Restaurant And New Bathrooms To Be Excellent,,,,,
,4294,Maybe Introduce Reusable Glass Bottles Of Water To The Rooms Rather Than All The Plastic Ones.,,,,,
,4298,Should Always Encourage Guests To Make It Clear Which Towels And Facilities They Have Used By Placing The Items In A Receptical / Bath  So You Do Not Need To Have All Towels Etc Cleaned Unecessarily,,,,,
,4301,Not My Specialist Area - I'm A Management Consultant.,,,,,
,4307,Dont Leave The Heating On So High On Constant And The Fire On Full - It Was Roasting When We Arrived.,,,,,
,4323,Does Not Reference My Stay. Figure This Our Yourself.,,,,,
,4324,Removal Of Room Fridges And Tea And Coffee Making Facitlies From Each Room.  From Our Experience Guests Are More Than Happy To Have A Comp Cup Of The Or Coffee In The Lounges And Interact With Others.  The Fridges Are Expensive To Run And No Doubt Noisy In The Rooms.,,,,,
,4328,Can't Think Of Any  As People Visit You For Pampering And Good Experience!,,,,,
,4338,I Don' Remember Seeing A Reference To 'Leave Towels In Bath If You Want Them Changing' Which Many Hotels Do Although I May Have Missed It..,,,,,
,4343,Emphasis On Local Food And Suppliers.,,,,,
,4347,Not Necessary To Have All Of The Lights On And A Gas Fire Blazing Away On A Summer's Afternoon When We Moved Into The Lodge.....,,,,,
,4350,Recycle The Kichen Rubbish! With 22 Lodges That Is Alot Of Bottles/ Cans/Cardboard And Paper Etc That Could Be Recycled And I Would Have Thought That Was An Obvious First Step!,,,,,
,4363,Mr. Aresti Drove By Car A Few Hundred Yards Over To A Gardener  Stayed There  Sitting In His Car  The Engine Still Running  For About A Quarter Of An Hour And Gave Instructions From The Driver´S Seat. Taking A Golf Cart Or Walking Would Have Made Much Less Impact On The Environment - A Changing Of This Behavior Will Make You 'Greener' In The Future.,,,,,
,4369,It Would Be Nice If The Staff At Reception Speaks More Languages Than Only English. Then The Feeling Of Being At Home Would Be Greater.,,,,,
,4370,Worry About Running A Hotel Properly First And Then You Can Think Of Such Fine Tuning.,,,,,
,4371,Bins Were Not Easy To Use  As They Filled Up And I Did Not Know Where To Put Our Rubbish ( In Rose Cottage) So Ended Up Not Descriminating The Rubbish,,,,,
,4381,Lose The Individual Hand Towels,,,,,
,4382,No Not Really  Sorry.,,,,,
,4385,Oh- This Reminds Me  It Is Incredibly Unsupportive To Your Other Guests That The Hotel Chooses To Park Its Hired 'People Movers' In The Closest Spots Down The Lane From The Chicken. This Act Alone Demonstrates How Poorly You Are Oriented To The Care Of Your Guests. As To This Question  How Could You Be Less Impactful On The Environment- Well  Start With Minimizing Light Pollution And Hood Outside Lights  Use Dimmer Outside Lights. That Would Be A Start. I Commend You For Asking That Guests Recycle. Bravo!,,,,,
,4395,Turn The Heating Down!,,,,,
,4397,Turn The Heating Down A Notch!,,,,,
,4403,You Are Doing A Great Job.,,,,,
,4415,Despite The Mild But Damp Weather The Heating Was On Full Blast. If It Needs To Be On Radiators With Individual Thermostats Would Be Better So Guests Can Control Their Room Temp. Lowered Room Temperatures Would Decrease Fuel Usage.,,,,,
,4418,I Don't Know What Efforts You Make Behind The Scenes But There Isn't Much I Can Suggest Out Front...,,,,,
,4420,Stop The Draught Coming Through The Windows!,,,,,
,4422,No,,,,,
,4436,Lower The Heating  Although I Think There Was A Problem With The System  But I Also Remember From My Last Visit  That It Was Also Rather Warm.,,,,,
,4439,New Technology Boilers  Solar Panels Somewhere  Hybrid Vehicles For Guest Collection From Airport Etc  E-Billing.,,,,,
,4446,Even Tough We Divided Our Rubbish- It Didn't Appear That You Do At The Hotel,,,,,
,4450,Provide Recycle Bins In The Lodges,,,,,
,4454,No,,,,,
,4467,Double Glaze Throughout!!,,,,,
,4469,Use Less Paper For Our Bills And Use Paper That Perhaps Is Slightly Less High Grade. Ground Source Heat Pumps To Heat The Pool Lodges And Hot Water.........................,,,,,
,4471,Inside The Lodges Have Recyclable Bins For Separating: -  1) Paper  Cardboard  Cans/Tins & Plastic 2) Glass Subject To Local Re Cycling Arrangements.,,,,,
,4473,Submitted After Previous Stay,,,,,
,4475,No. But Bring Back Bottled Water.  The Tap Water Does Not Taste Nice.,,,,,
,4477,Table Clothes Etc At Breakfast ..................Glass Tops Maybe,,,,,
,4480,No,,,,,
,4481,Difficult One...Loved The Hand Towels In The Ladies Loo And Towels In The Pool But Must Be Lots Of Laundering....However Its A Bit Of Luxury Nice To Have On Holiday,,,,,
,4492,Reduce The Heating When The Temperture Rises  Our Bedroom Was Very Warm And Needed The Window Opening And Some Of The Halllways And In Particular The Narrow Staircase Were Far To Hot. I Think The Hotel Could Save A Fortune On Heating If A Bit More Attention Was Given.,,,,,
,4495,The Fires Were Perhaps A Little Unnecessary  It Was Miserable Weather But Not Cold. However  They Cheered The Place Up And Were Probably Of Minimal Environmental Impact.,,,,,
,4498,We Sat By A Beautiful Fire In The Library  Fuelled By Gas  We Believe.  We Would Strongly Urge The Hotel To Look At Renewable Sources Of Heat And Hot Water  For Example  A Wood Chip Boiler.  There Are Good Renewable Heat Incentives (Rhi) Available Through Ofgem.,,,,,
,4499,No,,,,,
,4502,Change The Management And You Will Do A Better Job. The Hotel Director Is Only Focused On His Damagend Car  Not On The Hotel Facilities. The Green Is In A Very Bad Condition  Also The Rooms (Toilets  Curtains  Walls ....) ....,,,,,
,4503,None That Come To Mind.,,,,,
,4504,No,,,,,
,4506,Would Recommend You Visit (Either Online Or Personally) The Scarlet Hotel  Morgan Porth  Cornwall  Who Do The Eco Thing Really Well  With Comfort And Good Taste.,,,,,
,4510,Turn The Heating Down. The Rooms Were Uncomfortablely Warm.,,,,,
,4522,Room Need Some Upgrading  Change Cheap Light Switches With More Expensive Ones Change Rug On The Floor In Room 32 And Carpet ,,,,,
,4526,Don't Have Lights On In The Room When Guests Arrive - Having Them On Makes It Easier To Leave Them On When Leaving The Room,,,,,
,4534,Unfortunately Not,,,,,
,4539,No,,,,,
,4540,Recycle Bins In The Lodges Would Be A Start - Although A Small One.,,,,,
,4549,No,,,,,
,4562,Yes Get A Good Chef And Serve Hot And Presentable Food As Ours Was Rubbish And Very Slow And Cold,,,,,
,4567,Can't Think Of Anything...,,,,,
,4568,No,,,,,
,4572,Turn The Heating Down. The Bedroom Was Far Too Hot!,,,,,
,4583,There Didn't Seem To Be Any Rubbish Recycling Facilities In The Lodges?  It Would Be Worth Providing Separate Bags For Rubbish Or Encouraging Recycling In Other Ways?,,,,,
,4592,No,,,,,
,4594,The Refuse/Waste Collection System In The Lodge Was A Bit Vague.  If You Are Going To Supply Four Bins It Would Be Useful To Know How You Would Like Refuse To Be Collected. We Would Have Been More Than Happy To Dispose Of Bottles  Plastic Water Bottles Etc In A Recycling Unit Had One Been Available,,,,,
,4605,Yes.  Environment Must Include The Birds.  I Felt Very Uncomfortable About Witnessing The Sole Caged Parrot In The Sitting Room - It Seemed So Sad.  I Felt Sad For The Sole Caged Budgerigar At Reception.  It Didn't Feel Comfortable That A Young Hawk Was Allowed To Rest Free In Reception In Close Proximity To The Caged Budgie - On The Counter  An Office Chair  On The Computer Printer.  All This Didn't Feel Very 'Green' To Me.  Having Said That It Was A Marvel To See The Bird So Close  But Wrong.,,,,,
,4607,No Need To Change The Bathroom Towels Unless Left In The Bath.,,,,,
,4610,Double Glazing Would Help A Lot But I Suppose You're Not Allowed To Do That.,,,,,
,4613,No Comment To Make.,,,,,
,4616,More Obvious Recycling Facilities For Example Used Newspapers,,,,,
,4619,Less Heat In The Corridors. They Were Very Hot  Whilst The Bistro Was Quite Chilly.,,,,,
,4623,Although You Had Three Coloured Bins  It Was Not Clear What Went Into What Or How  When You Put Them Out  You Indentified Which Was Which.,,,,,
,4627,The Same As Many Other Hotels - Suggest To Guests That They Use Towels More Than Once!,,,,,
,4644,Our Room Was A Little Hot Requiring Us To Open A Window At Night.  Perhaps Accurate Thermostats In The Room Would Help.,,,,,
,4648,As Above. We Don't Mind Paying Top Dollar But It Felt Like You Wanted To Charge For Every Tiny Experience.,,,,,
,4649,As The Food Was Locally Sourced And The Water From Your Own Source  My Only Comment Would Be That Our Only Way To Cool The Lodge Down Was To Open The Windows And Doors,,,,,
,4651,Like The Glass Water Bottles And Think You Are Doing Well As Far As I Know.,,,,,
,4652,None That Would Really Make Any Difference.You Do Need Some Clearer Signs From The Surrounding Villages Advising Where You Are Actually Located !,,,,,
,4656,Hope You Buy Food In Bulk Without Packaging. It Looks Very Green,,,,,
,4664,Very Large Bottles Of Toiletries In The Bathroom With Pump Action To Save The Use Of All The Little Bottles Of Shampoo Etc,,,,,
,4674,Is There Need For The Valet Parking Really?  As Only A Small Car Park And Easy To Use    A Waste Of Start/ Stopping Of Engines And Night Excessive Need For Headlights  Shunting The Cars.,,,,,
,4676,Separate Bin In Bedrooms For Recycling Such As Newspapers And Bottles - And To Encourage Guests To Use These (And Eliminate The Need For Staff To Have To Go Through The Bin To Separate These Items?),,,,,
,4680,Offer Guests The Opion To Retain Towels Rather Than Changing Automatically,,,,,
,4683,None,,,,,
,4695,Can't Think Of Any At Present,,,,,
,4697,You Could Cut The Rough On The Golf Course Shorter So I Don't Loose So Many Balls!,,,,,
,4699,Install Towel Bars Or Hooks In The Bathrooms.  Quit Pushing Bottled Water In The Dining Room.  Public Rooms Were Overheated.,,,,,
,4710,Make It Easy To Recycle In The Room (I Have Seen A Nice Woven Two Compartment Waste Basket In The Us Which Has One Side For Trash And One For Recycling).  Also  Make It Easier To Recycle The Plastic Water Bottles (As In Have A Nice Recycling Bin Just Inside The Main Entrance).,,,,,
,4717,There Is A Total Lack Of Animal Life At Bovey Castle. There Is Plenty Of Space And Yet No Animal Seen. You Do Not Use Local Produce At All It Seems Or At Least There Is No Evidence And I Also Failed To See Any Literature Promoting Any Local Events/ Attractions Giving The Opinion That You Seek To Capture Your Visitors.,,,,,
,4724,Green Is Good But Quality Is Best.,,,,,
,4725,Relaying Every Table In The Dining Room For B/F And Dinner When Only 20% Were Being Occupied Seems Over The Top.,,,,,
,4728,Didn't See Many Low Energy Light Bulbs?,,,,,
,4729,No,,,,,
,4732,Turn Down The Heating When It's Not Really Necessary If Ambient Temperatures Dictate As This Past Weekend.  Also Towels Appeared To Be Changed Daily And Could Have Been Renewed Only If Guests Request So.,,,,,
,4737,Very Funny Question As The Car Park Is Totally Full And There Was A Helicopter On The Lawn!!,,,,,
,4740,No,,,,,
,4746,No.,,,,,
,4747,Remove All Hand Towels In Toilets,,,,,
,4751,No,,,,,
,4754,Recycling Facility For Lodge Rubbish?,,,,,
,4756,Draft Proof The Window Casements. You Would Reduce Your Heating Bill By 20%,,,,,
,4757,None.,,,,,
,4758,None I Can Think Of,,,,,
,4762,Send A Mini Bus For Us! Ha Ha,,,,,
,4764,Ground Source Heat Pump To Provide Background Heating. Solar Pv Panels For Electricity And Charging Up Electric Golf Buggies.,,,,,
,4765,None,,,,,
,4772,This Question Is Self Serving,,,,,
,4779,No,,,,,
,4784,Probably Turn Down The Heating In The Bedrooms Which Were Overly Warm.,,,,,
,4787,Fires Were Lit In The Lounges Despite It Being The Peak Of Summer Why ?  Towels Were Changed Twice A Day Without Request From Us As Guest - Surely Guests Can Be Expected To Use Them More Than Once As They Would At Home.  However  Would Need More Handrails In The Bathroom To Hang Them On.,,,,,
,4795,If That Is Your Main Consideration  Closing The Hotel Is Possibly The Greatest Contibution To The Environment,,,,,
,4800,We Sorted Our Rubbish To The Relevant Bins And Then Were Told Not To Bother!,,,,,
,4801,The Wonderful Swimming Pool Does Not Have To Be Kept So Warm. It Was Approx. 90 Degrees F  Which Is Too Warm For Most People. Recommend Lowering It To 85 Degrees  Which Is Perfect For Both Refreshing Bathing And Swimming Lengths.,,,,,
,4803,Worry About Getting Your Internal Systems Correct First......And When You Do Have Time To Worry About The Environment Please Do Not Put Those Insincere Notices In The Bathrooms About Reducing The Washing Of Towels - They Infuriate!  Best Wishes For 2013,,,,,
,4811,Give Guests The Choice To Use Bath Towels For More Than 1 Day.,,,,,
,4812,Dont Know Enough About Your Infrastructure.,,,,,
,4816,Community Links,,,,,
,4819,Ignore Green Nonsense,,,,,
,4821,You Might Be Able To Take Advantage Of Government Initiatives For The Use Of Renewable Energy Sources Such As Solar.,,,,,
,4830,Not Really I'm Afraid,,,,,
,4831,Double Glaze The Windows (In A Sympathetic Way).,,,,,
,4833,No. Seemed Ok To Me.,,,,,
,4838,I Fully Appreciate Heating Impacts On The Environment But Providing An Electric Heater To Cold Guests Cannot Do The Hotel's Reputation Or The Environment Any Favours,,,,,
,4839,Activities Are Expensive. The Business Center Is Embarassing For Such A Location And Is Useless.,,,,,
,4841,Please Don't Pretend That By Not Washing All The Towels Everyday That You Will Save The Planet......If You Do It Be Honest And Say That You Do It To Save Money!,,,,,
,4843,No,,,,,
,4844,As I Arrived By Car I Could Hardly Offer Advice On Green Issues. Although I Do Wish Businesses Would Cease Involving Me In This Aspect Of There Business. If You Want To Be Green Ok  But I Am Not That Interested In The Processes.,,,,,
,4846,Fine  Don't Go Overboard,,,,,
,4849,Separate Bins For Paper Plastic Etc In The Rooms And On The Course,,,,,
,4855,Turn Down The Heating.,,,,,
,4856,Possibly Our Bedroom Was Too Hot.  We Had To Open The Windows & Turn Down The Rads.,,,,,
,4862,Set Radiator Themostats To Lower Setting As Stadard And Increase On Customer Arrival If Required,,,,,
,4867,It Would Appear That Bovey Is Very Compassionate Toward The Environement.,,,,,
,4868,No,,,,,
,4873,Lower The Temp Settings In The Lodge From 26 Degrees,,,,,
,4884,Biomass Boiler For Heating  It Burns Recycled Wood And Provides Central Heating And Hot Water At A Fraction Of The Price And Impact On The Environment.,,,,,
,4886,Lighting In Guest Rooms And Toilet Areas Could Be Pir Controlled,,,,,
,4900,Make Better Use Of Led Bulbs And Get Rid Of Your Mr16 Bulbs That You Use In The Rooms  Change Them For Led.,,,,,
,4901,We Like The Addition Of The Composting Bin In The Kitchen.  This Was New Since Our 2011 Stay.  It Would Be Nice To See A Recycling Bin For Unsoiled Papers  Plastics And Glass If This Is Even Done In Devon.,,,,,
,4906,None,,,,,
,4907,Using More Organic And Biodegradable Shampoo/Bodywash Etc In The Changing Rooms To Reduce The Impact On The Environment.  We Feel It Is Unneccessary To Provide Disposable Slippers And Disposable Toiletries.,,,,,
,4913,You Had No Provision For Re-Cycling In The Lodges. I Was Disappointed To Note That I Couldn't Get Rid Of My Plastic Bottles Etc Into The Recycling  There Was Just One Bin,,,,,
,4919,Are The Small Hand-Towels In The Toilets Necessary?,,,,,
,4937,No,,,,,
,4942,No. ,,,,,
,4946,Not Have Lights Turned On In Room Prior To Arrival Or Perhaps Just One Light. ,,,,,
,4948,We Found It Surprising That There Were No Recycling Facilities At The Lodge.,,,,,
,4952,Key Cards To Keep Lights On Only Whilst Room Is Occupied,,,,,
,4974,No   Good Work Being Done Already ,,,,,
,4983,Bring Down Your Bar Prices For A Kick Off Your Mark Up Must Be Massive Just In The Bar,,,,,
,4990,Better Control For Heating In Rooms. ,,,,,
,4996,Put Towels In The Shower/Bath That You Want Washed. Make It Clear That You Recycle All Waste - We Ended Up Putting Lots Of Plastic Bottles In Our Waste Bin And Were Concerned They Would'nt Be Recycled Install (If You Haven't Already) A Biomass System Use (If You Don't Already) Seasonal Food With Low Food Miles ,,,,,
,5014,Reduce Temperature Of Hot Water In Bathrooms  Really Too Hot To Wash Hands Under. Use Large Containers Of Toiletries Rather Than Lots Of Little Bottles.,,,,,
,5016,We Couldnt Find The Light Switch For The Kitchen In Our Lodge And So Had To Leave The Light On.   We Thought The Single Use Hand Towels Were Unnecessary And Will Require A Lot Of Extra Washing,,,,,
,5018,Turn Down Some Of The Radiators  It Is Much Too Hot.   Repair Windows That Are Not Fitting Properly  And Stop The Draughts.   \I Realise It Is An Old Building  But The Windows Are Not That Old  They Are Double Glazed.,,,,,
,5025,Would Not Change Anything ,,,,,
,5030,Turn Heating Down Slightyly,,,,,
,5035,I Believe You Have Achieved A Great Way To Help The Environment.   To Get 100Per Cent May Well Compromise On The Whole Homely And Comfortable Feel You Give To Your Guests. ,,,,,
,5036,Could Use Environmental Friendly Cars.,,,,,
,5040,Lodge Was Far Too Warm On Arrival ,,,,,
,5042,Recycle In The Lodges,,,,,
,5044,Provide Individual Towel And Robe For Spa /Pool Rather Than Having Piles Of Towels In Pool Area Which Encourage Waste And Lots Of Washing . Hair Shampoo And Bath Gel Etc In Dispensers Rather Than Individual Pots.,,,,,
,5053,No Though It Would Be Helpful To Make The Dog Bins Easier To Find - Over The Three Days I Managed To Only Locate 2 Of The Bins - Perhaps A Map For Those People With Dogs So That They Can Use Them Effectively.,,,,,
,5055,The Ever-Flowing River Could Easily Be Used To Produce Hydro-Electric Power?,,,,,
,5063,No,,,,,
,5069,Instal Recycling Bins,,,,,
,5070,Reuse The Doggie Towels,,,,,
,5072,Time Out Lighting To Rooms,,,,,
,5073,Refuse Bags And Recycling Points Within The Hotel Grounds  So That Guests Can Feel Responsible Too. Is There Any Intention To Use Green Energy?,,,,,
,5074,Hmm  Always A Tricky One With Hotels As They Use So Much Energy Just To Keep Running. Keep The Laundry To A Minimum Is What I Always Suggest.,,,,,
,5077,Turn The Heating Down!,,,,,
,5095,I Think You Could Have A Sign In Each Bathroom To Indicate To Guests That Only Towels Placed In The Bathtub Need To Be Replaced Each Day. This Would Make A Considerable Saving To The ' Twice' Daily Laundering Costs.,,,,,
,5098,No,,,,,
,5104,No.  You Seemed To Be Doing Fine.,,,,,
,5105,The Single Glazed Windows Aren't Great ! Start Your Own Home Farm For Produce (Could Also Be A Lecture On Wet Days  See Above!) - Just A Thought !,,,,,
,5106,The Heating In The Corridors Was Over Powerful And Could Be A Little Less Intense To Save On Energy.  Maybe Lights In The Gym/Changing Rooms Could Be On A Timer Or Motion Activated. ,,,,,
,5117,We Weren't Aware Of A Way To Recycle Plastics  Glass And Paper. ,,,,,
,5119,Explain To Guests The Measures You Take To Reduce The Hotel's Carbon Footprint - I.E. Energy Efficiency  Recycling Etc. The Hotel's Emphasis On Sourcing Local Produce For Diners Is Excellent.,,,,,
,5120,Less Pre-Packed Pre-Prepared Food In The Bistro.,,,,,
,5126,Seriously? I Don't Remember Seeing Anything To Indicate An Awareness Of 'Green' Issues While I Was There. I'm Not Sure Many Of Your Clientele Care Too Much About The Environment When Turning Up In A Range Rover?,,,,,
,5129,A Chance To Recycle In The Rooms Would Be Good. A Separate Bin For Paper And Card. ,,,,,
,5140,The Welcome Package That Has Been Sent Could Have Come By Email..............,,,,,
,5141,No I Would Say Everything Is Up To Standard And Very Well Organised And Also Staff Are Polite Enjoyed Everything All Round,,,,,
,5143,Turn The Heating Down It Was Very Hot ,,,,,
,5144,Very Hot Hotel So Maybe Turn Hearing Down A Bit ,,,,,
,5146,Send Bill By E Mail ,,,,,
,5159,I Notice You Don't Put A Card In The Bathroom Asking Guests To Put Their Towels In The Bath If They Would Like Them Changing As Many Hotels Do - I Don't Know If This Means They Are All Changed Every Day - If So  Probably Not Necessary. Oh And It Was Very Warm In Public Areas. I'm Sure It's Hard To Strike A Balance With Heating And You Don't Want People To Complain Of Being Too Cold - But The Corridor By Reception And The Entrance To The Ladies Changing Rooms At The Pool Were Stifling!,,,,,
,5162,No,,,,,
,5168,No.,,,,,
,5169,No,,,,,
,5174,Reduce The Heating! Commented About The Overbearing Heat In The Corridor Near Reception And Reception Staff Agreed It Was Too Hot.,,,,,
,5175,It Was Extremely Hot When We Arrived And So We Opened Our Windows To Let The Heat Out Perhaps The Thermostat Could Be Turned Down A Notch.,,,,,
,5176,The Heating Although Very Welcoming Was Turned Up Very High In Some Parts Of Building  Almost Too Hot At Times  Could Be Regulated Better ,,,,,
,5180,Turn The Heating Down...Especially In The Day Time,,,,,
,5181,Public Areas Of The Hotel Extremely Hot,,,,,
,5191,No. All Fine.,,,,,
,5193,No  This Was Very Impressive. I Loved The Local Produce Angle.,,,,,
,5203,Second Recycling Bin The Bathroom. ,,,,,
,5207,Not Right Now (Am Assuming You Do The Usual Recycling  Deal With The Food Waste Issue Etc) But Very Pleased To Hear You Take It So Seriously.,,,,,
,5210,Not To Leave The Lights On In The Bedrooms When Unoccupied,,,,,
,5213,The Heating Was High. Your Bills Must Be Too. Do You Use Renewable Energy?  So Many Trees And Lots Of Water - Biomass  Hydro?,,,,,
,5214,The Dining Room Was A Bit Hot And At Breakfast We Ended Up Opening Some Windows. This Cannot Be Efficient.,,,,,
,5219,No,,,,,
,5220,It Was Very Nice To Find Hand Towels In The Gents Toilets In Communal Areas However We Questioned If The Laundry Of These Was Not A Little Environmentally Challenging.,,,,,
,5221,I Didn't Notice If You Had A Sign Regarding Reusing Towels? I Think Turn The Heating Down A Bit! We Had To Open The Windows As It Was On Full Blast And Was Too Hot!,,,,,
,5223,I Didn't Notice Any Of Those Messages About Towels That You See In Number Of Hotels.,,,,,
,5224,Nothing Springs To Mind. I Liked The Fact That You Draw Your Water Locally - Again The Explanation Was Useful And Interesting.  One Thing I Have Just Remembered Relevant To Previous Questions - Why Do Hotels Never Provide Something Into Which You Can Put Your Used Teabags?! Aren't We Making Extra Work For People Cleaning The Waste Bins? I Guess This Could Be A 'Greener' Thing As You Might Use Less Cleaning Product. Also How About A Door Wedge For Getting Out Of The Bedroom Doors With A Suitcase? (City Hotels Have This Similar Kind Of Attention To Detail.),,,,,
,5232,No,,,,,
,5233,See Previous Comment,,,,,
,5235,Our Room Felt Very Warm Despite The Heating Being Off  Not Sure If The Heat Was Residual In The Building From The Fires Or An Integral And Unseen Heating System. If So It Could Be Turned Down A Notch!,,,,,
,5239,To Change Anything Would Be Criminal. Stay As You Are Your Doing Great.,,,,,
,5242,Carry On Doing Great Work.,,,,,
,5248,Not That I Can Think Of.,,,,,
,5249,Email Bills Rather Than Printing Them And Putting Them In Envelopes. ,,,,,
,5279,It Was Slightly Too Easy To Help Ourselves To Lots Of Towels In The Pool Area (We Didn't)  So Maybe A Notice There Asking People To Be Green (There Might Already Be One),,,,,
,5289,Not That Important To You When You Floodlight The Front Of The Building!,,,,,
,5292,We Had A Great Time. It's So Relaxing And Nice To See Dogs And Young Children Around You. The Atmosphere Is Fantastic. We Defenately Come Again. Thank You All So Much For Our Nice Stay.,,,,,
,5301,Use More Natural And Or Organic Mainstream Shower Etc Products Eg Jason Or Tisserand Or Dr Haushka,,,,,
,5303,The Obvious Attention To The Environment Was Another Feature Which Impressed Us.  Perhaps  If They Could Be Carefully Screened From View  Solar Panels Might Reduce The Electricity Impact.,,,,,
,5304,Some Corridors Were Very Warm. 
Our Room Was Very Warm. ,,,,,
,5307,Source Food Locally To Reduce Your Carbon Foot-Print
Use Recycled Materials Where Appropriate (Stationary  Toilet Paper)
Use Ethical Brands That Fit With Your Brand
Promote British Products,,,,,
,5308,Insulation For The Windows - The Windows Were Very Draughty ,,,,,
,5318,You Need To Have Solar Power Heating Up An Outside Pool And Hot Tub.  Electric Quad Bikes For Guests To Use Powered By Solar Power Would Be A Great Attraction.  I Have More Ideas But I'd Need To Write Those Separately. ,,,,,
,5322,Towels  Sheets  Less Waste  Recyclable Elements  Smart Lightening 
Generate Energy From The Sun  Wind  Water ,,,,,
,5327,Sort Out Your Heating - I Dread To Think What Your Energy Bills Are ! ,,,,,
,5328,Explain What All The Different Number Of Bins Are For In The Lodges!! (Which Are For Paper Plastic Food Etc Etc)
Encourage More Wildlife Onto Your Grounds - Nesting Boxes In The Trees? Duck Houses For The Lakes? Bee And Butterfly Friendly Wild Gardens? ,,,,,
,5333,I Used A Towel When I Arrived And Hung It Up On The Side  When Someone Came In To Turn Down The Bed This Towel Appears To Have Been Removed Which Seems A Waste Of Washing As I Had Barely Used It  It May Have Just Been Hung Up Neatly (It All Seemed Too Neat And Clean)  In Which Case You Can Ignore This Comment!,,,,,
,5337,Not That I Can Think Of,,,,,
,5338,Can't Help With This One.,,,,,
,5339,Yes You Could Change All Of Your Lighting To Led Lamps.,,,,,
,5342,Solar Panels On The Roof To Heat The Pool.,,,,,
,5344,Not At This Time.,,,,,
,5347,No  I Think You Are Doing A Good Job Already,,,,,
,5349,Little Things Make All The Difference.  ,,,,,
,5350,Not At This Time,,,,,
,5352,No,,,,,
,5358,Nothing I Can Think Of,,,,,
,5362,No,,,,,
,5365,Turn Down The Heating In The Spa Area.,,,,,
,5369,Water Mill In The River To Generate Electricity. ,,,,,
,5373,Sorry  No.,,,,,
,5378,Unfortunately Unable To Comment On This As We Did Not Really Pay Attention To That Aspect. We Did Like The Fact That The Water In The Bathrooms Was Sourced Locally. ,,,,,
,5382,No,,,,,
,5383,The Pool Was Actually A Bit Hotter Than Need Be...Probably For Families.. 
The Windows Are Beautiful But Yuou Must Loose A Lot Of Heat.. I Bet Doouble Glazed Replicas Would Pay Back In A Year Or So.,,,,,
,5387,None I Can Think Of Apart From Having Your Own Water Powered Electricity Source From The River Running Through The Grounds?,,,,,
,5388,Many Hotels Ask For Towels That Need Changing To Be Left On The Floor Or In The Bath  While Those The Guest Feels Are Still Clean Can Be Hung Up. The Idea Bent To Minimise The Laundry.,,,,,
,5389,Reduce Noise Pollution !,,,,,
,5392,No,,,,,
,5397,Loved Using River Water,,,,,
,5401,Edwardian Grill Could Be A Bit Cooler. It Was Very Warm And We Asked For Windows To Be Opened.,,,,,
,5406,The Lodge Had Immersion Heaters And The Boiler Going Far More Than Needed. In Fact We Turned Off The Immersion Heater As It Was Surplus To Requirements. Every Switch Seemed To Be Turned On A Pumping Out Heat! Also To Have Things Either In Timers Or Turn The Thermostat Down With Instructions On How To Put It Up  As The Home Was Well Beyond A Comfortable Level Of Central Heating. We Could Have Easily Placed Used Towels On The Floor Which Were Used And Ones Which Weren't Still In Their Places.. ,,,,,
,5413,You Look To Be Doing A Very Good Job In This Respect And I Have Nothing To Recommend On The Basis Of A Short (2 Day) Visit.,,,,,
,5415,Additional Bin In Rooms Specifically For Recyclable Materials - Would Be Easy To Do But Make A Big Difference Without Being Too Intrusive.,,,,,
,5416,Turn The Heating Down  It Was Too Hot In The Room  And At One Point The Radiator Was Hot  And Our Windows Were Open  Waiting For The Radiator To Cool Down. ,,,,,
,5417,Would Suggest Reduce The Heating Level As It Really Hit You When You Entered The Main Rooms As Against The Failry Warm Weather Outside. ,,,,,
,5423,We Were Only There For Two Days And Would Have Been Happy To Reuse Our Towels  Maybe You Could Put A Note In Bathrooms For Customers To Put Towels That Need Changing In The Bath?
Do You Use Solar Or Underground Heating?,,,,,
,5425,There Is Motion/Heat Sensing Technology Out Now That Can Sense When People Are Present In A Room Or Not  I Think There Could Be A Prompt Cost And Power Saving To Be Made If You Trialled This In A Couple Of Rooms With A Cost Analysis Compared To Equivalent Rooms That Are Prepared For New Guest Arrivals (I.E Lights & Tv Ect Come On Automatically As Guests First Enters The Room. John Lewis Sell A Home And Domestic Version But There Are Solutions For Enterprise Such As Hotels & Hospitals Etc Made Byt He Same Company I Think. Otherwise You Have A Fantastic Environment And I Felt Proud To Be English Seeing What Breathtaking Grounds And Talented Groundsman You Have Here Right At Home In England.  ,,,,,
,5428,We Felt The Hotel Was Over-Heated Particularly At Night And In The Morning. Reducing The Heating Slightly Would Have Been More Comfortable And Would Reduce The Impact On The Environment. ,,,,,
,5429,The Underfloor Heating In The Bathroom In Our Castle Room Was Very High  If You Bring It Down Or Turn It Off This Could Help To Reduce Costs And Fuel Usage Which In Turn May Help The Environment.,,,,,
,5433,Can't Think Of Anything....But I Thought It Was Lovely That The Venue Allows Guests To Bring Their Dogs In.,,,,,
