,----------------------,,,,,,
,1280,Very Good  Excellent Service.,,,,,
,1281,Staff Were Apparently Poorly Trained And Not Supervised. Room Cleaning Was Haphazard.,,,,,
,1282,This Was My First Trip To London.  The Service From All Staff Was Excellent  Particularly At The Front Desk/Concierge.  The Quality Of The Linens And Other Amenities Were Above Par.  Thank You For A Most Enjoyable And Comfortable Stay.,,,,,
,1283,I Was There With My Daughter And 2 Grandchildren. We Were Pleased With Our Rooms. The Staff  For The Most Part Was Helpful. I Chose A Hotel Rather Than Apartment Because I Knew I Would Need Help From The Concierge. We Did Get To One Place Late Because They Did Not Mention That The Globe Closes At 12:30 Though They Did Tell Us To Get There Early. They Recommended A Restaurant Twice  Do You Have Relationships With Certain Restaurants? In Going A Different Way We Found Many Restaurants To Choose From. That Was My Only Complaint.,,,,,
,1285,Attentive Service. Gréât Confortable Accommodations.,,,,,
,1286,Excellent. Will Definitely Be Back,,,,,
,1287,Very Pleasant Stay - Staff Were All Excellent & Friendly,,,,,
,1288,You Hotel Is One Of The Best We Have Ever Stayed In The Whole Experience Is Superb   Unfortunately We Did Not Win The Motor Transport Awards Haulier Of The Year This Year But We Will Be Back Next Year And Staying With You Again  Our Staff & Clients Loved Your Hotel Thank You And See You Soon Kevin & Sarah Hopper Brian Yeardley Continental.,,,,,
,1289,We Had A Most Relaxing Stay  And Felt Confident In The Professionalism That Was Clearly Obvious.
Attention To Detail Was Greatly Appreciated.,,,,,
,1290, Pleasurable  And Un-Complicated ,,,,,
,1291,It Is A Really Good Hotel  I Would Just Try To Personalize The Service A Bit More. If You Can Make It Feel A Little Warmer And More Personal It Will Really Set Off The Feel To The Place.,,,,,
,1292,Excellent Rooms  Value For Money  Convenient Location.,,,,,
,1293,It Had All The Qualities And Feel Of A Top Class Luxury Boutique Hotel Without The Over Priced Price Tag ,,,,,
,1294,Very Good !!!,,,,,
,1295,The Hotel Is Lovely. I Was Treated Wonderfully. I Would Caution Those With Allergies/Sensitivities To Perfumes And Scents That The Hotel Does Use Strong Scents And Perfumes As Part Of Their Room Cleaning  And That Those Scents Linger For Days Even When The Sources Are Removed.,,,,,
,1296,Good - Room Cleanliness And Amenities (Refrigerator  Nightly Water Provided  Good Cooling System  Comfortable Bed  Sky Full Channel Selection)  Bathroom Amenities (Tv  Fogless Mirror  Shower Pressure)
Moderate - Breakfast Service Was Flawless At 6:45Am And Completely Disorganized By 9:30Am (No Tables Set  Poor Service Requiring Repeated Requests For The Same Items)  Front Desk And Door Staff Service Levels - Some Staff Were Excellent/Others Were Quite Poor And Almost Unfriendly
Poor - As An Honoured Member Of Slh  I Expect To Be Recognized And Rewarded Appropriately  And Experienced Neither.  I Was Not Offered A Room Upgrade.  I Was Denied Late Checkout Until I Complained And It Was Then Provided.  And I Noted After I Checked Out That My Reservation Was To Have Included A Complementary Cocktail And A "Stylish Welcome Gift " Neither Of Which Were Provided.  A True 5* Hotel Does Not Require Their Frequent Guests To Beg For Recognition.,,,,,
,1297,Very Good Experience  The Staff Was Extremely Helpful And Friendly.  Rooms Were Clean And Comfortable.  

Only Recommendation Is With Regards To The Electronic Notification System For The Room Which Indicates 'Do Not Disturb'  'Room Cleaning'... The Light Would Not Stay Fixed On What I Chose  It Could Reset Itself Constantly Which In One Case Caused House Cleaning To Enter My Room While I Was There Because The Light Would Not Stay On 'Do Not Disturb'.  It Was Reset One Time But It Didn't Seem To Work...,,,,,
,1301,Verry Nice,,,,,
,1302,Rooms Were Very Clean Well Prepared. The Service Level And Attention To Detail Was Outstanding. Management Should Be Quit Proud Of Its Service Level And Friendly Supporting Staff.,,,,,
,1303,A Fantastic Retreat. Excellent Facilities  Larger Than Normal Rooms And Great Staff Engagement. Thank You.,,,,,
,1304,I Was Very Impressed By The Service Of All The Staff Members At The Hotel.  From The Friendly Greeting From The Concierge And Doorman  Efficient Check In By The Front Desk And Not Forgetting The Excellent Service And Recomendation By The Staff Working At The Restaurant.  All The Dishes And Drinks We Had Were Delicious.  I Felt A Great Team Effort By All The Staff In Making The Guests Feel Welcome And Everyone Was Very Helpful.  I Will Without A Doubt Stay At Your Hotel Again On My Next Visit To London.,,,,,
,1306,You Should Know By Now That It Is My Home In London. My Daughters And I Absolutely Love It. I Am Back This Friday 25/7. Excellent  Excellent  Excellent.,,,,,
,1308,Customer Focussed To Make Sure We Have The Best Experience Staying There,,,,,
,1309,Free Wifi  Free Softs And Nespresso Coffee Marchine Are Definite Plus,,,,,
,1310,The Room Was Small But Very Suitable  As Were The Facilities In It  The Turn-Down Service Was Brilliant  As The Big Pillows Were Stashed Away  The Small Touches Like The Ground Level Light In The Bathroom And The Free Soft Drinks Were Excellent. The Staff Were Also Very Good. Not Overly Solicitous Which Can Get On Your Nerves Sometimes  And The Piece De Resistance Was The Bed  It Was The Most Comfortable I Have Ever Slept In A Hotel. ,,,,,
,1311,The Staff Went Much Further Than In Other Hotels. It Was The Extra Care  Like Taking The Time To Explain The Air Conditioning System Or Noticing Which Kinds Of Water We Preferred And Making Sure We Had An Ample Supply. Or The Swift Response When We Needed Something   Like An Iron Or Additional Coffee And Milk. ,,,,,
,1312,Wonderful - Great Service,,,,,
,1313,Great Service  Exceptional Rooms  Friendly Efficient Staff. We Have Stayed A Number Of Times And Are Regularly Upgraded And This Is Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,1314,Thoroughly Enjoyed The Facilities And The Room.  All Staff Were Professional And Friendly.,,,,,
,1315,I Honestly Can Not Fault Anything About The Hotel .,,,,,
,1316,Exceptional Service  Beautiful Accommodation.,,,,,
,1317,I've Stayed At Quite A Few Hotels And This Was One Of The Best I've Been At--The Service Was Impeccable  The Bed Was Superb  And The Location Couldn't Be Better. Incredible.,,,,,
,1318,We Had A Perfect Stay At The Arch.  If There Were Anything To Note  It's A Shame That There Isn't A Courtyard Where One Can Sit Outdoors -- We Were Lucky To Have Lovely Weather. Just A Little Problem When I Was Trying To Find A Phone Number Of Friends And The Person Who Took My Call Didn't Understand My Request At All.  Breakfast Service Was Slow The First Day And So  The Second  We Opted For The Buffet. But All Staff Is Friendly And In General  Competent And Obliging. No Complaints Whatsoever Concerning The Comfort Of The Room  Cleanliness  Etc.,,,,,
,1319,Extremely Comfortable  Very Helpful Staff And Manager  A Great Experience Again.,,,,,
,1320,Very Good&Gt;  Staff Are Excellent,,,,,
,1321,Relaxing And Very Good As Ever ,,,,,
,1322,Very Nice  From The Checking In Service To The Immense Room Service. My Only Issue Is If You Do Not Have Your 'Zzzzz' Red Light On  Then Maids Will Walk Straight Into Your Room. I Know It May Look Like Common Sense Buttons To Most People  But It Can Be Easily Missed Especially If You Don't Know How The Buttons Work Or Are A 'Techno-Phobe'. Another Slight Issue Is There's No Room Service Number On Any Of The Sheets/Handbook  Makes You Feel Slightly Awkward If You Keep Phoning Reception Just To Ask To Be Put Through To Room Service.,,,,,
,1323,Relaxed And Comfortable,,,,,
,1324,I Was Very Disappointed That I Was Fined For Smoking In The Room When This Was Not The Case  I Have A Habit Of Keeping Cigarete Butts In My Handbag If I Cant Fine A Rubbish Bin And This Caused The Smell Of Tobacco In The Room  So I Was Very Disappointed That You Fined Me 200 Pounds Also I Damaged My Toe By Banging Off The Steel Bar At The End Of The Bed Which I Did Not Complain About  So I Would Be Grateful If You Would Return The Money To My Credit Card Asap,,,,,
,1327,Very Nice  Beautiful Room  Great Breakfast,,,,,
,1328,Only Stayed One Night.  My Only Complaint When We Arrived Was That The Person Taking Us To Our Room Had No Idea Where It Was.  Would Also Have Liked To Have Been Informed In Advance (The Booking Was Made A Few Months Earlier) That Our Room Was In The Basement Of The Building.,,,,,
,1329,Very Pleasent Stay. I Arrived Late For A Team Dinner But The Staff Did A Great Job In Providing Me With A Main Course And Dessert With Minimal Fuss. Bedroom Fit - Out Was Excellent. Tv In Teh Bathrooom A Cool Touch And Free Soft Drinks From Eth Mini Bar Clearly Sign - Posted. ,,,,,
,1331,Amazing. As Usuall ...,,,,,
,1332,Nice Rooms And Very Good Service At A Prime London Lolcation,,,,,
,1333,Pleasant ! Very Lovely And Sweet Staff. Had A Great Time And Will Definitely Come Back :D,,,,,
,1334,Very Good,,,,,
,1336,Perfect!! Fantastic Staff  Beautiful Room. Our Stay Was Fautless!,,,,,
,1337,It Was Very Calming Despite The Stress During The Event. My Room Was Tiny In Comparison To Others. As A Group We Had A Spare Room Available  After Negotiations My Agency Wasn't Able To Swap The Room For A Voucher To Use At Another Time. Even A Few Days That Were Outside The 48Hours. That Was Quite Disappointing. The Other Thing Was That The Hotel Could Have Suggested My Swapping For The Larger Room As It Was Not Being Used. That Would Have Made A Lot Of Difference.
Regards 
Ada,,,,,
,1338,My Daughter And I Had A Pleasure To Stay At Your Hotel. Reception Staff Is Very Helpful And Qualified. Service Is On The High Level  Room Was Comfortable. I Am Quite A Choosy Client  But Your Hotel Has Nothing To Complain About. ,,,,,
,1339,We Had A Group Of 35 For A Period Of 4 Nights (Thursday 31St And Departed On Monday 4Th August).  All Staff Were Absolutely Amazing  They Made A Very Challenging Group More Manageable By Being So Supportive. 

I Have Already Recommended Your Hotel To Everyone That I Have Spoken To Since Our Stay And Will Most Definitely Be Using Your Hotel In The Future. 

Everything About Our Stay Was Perfect! 

Thank You.
Lizzie Harvey,,,,,
,1340,Very Good. Had A Very Pleasant Stay. The Ac Is A Bit Loud And The Selector Knob In The Bathtub Was Loose And Kept Falling Out Of Place  Was Too Busy To Report It During Stay But I Mentioned It During Checkout. In All A Very Nice Hotel With Great Location And Most Importantly Clean. ,,,,,

,1342,Efficient Friendly Check In. Spacious Bathroom Is Great. Fast And Complimentary Wifi Is Also Great. ,,,,,

,1353,One Word "Perfect",,,,,
,1354,A Very Friendly Hotel In The Centre Of London  This May Sound Small But We Had A Dvd Player (Never Had One Previously In All The Hotels I Have Spent In London)  All Soft Drinks Free (Never Had Them) And A Television In The Bathroom.
I Have Spent Time In Many 5 Star Hotels In London And I Would Say This Is The Friendliest And Most Efficient  Should Be A 5 Star Hotel,,,,,

Clean
Good Additional Services (Food),,,,,
,1374,The Arch Has Become A Home-Away-From-Home When I'm In London; It's A Place I Can Relax  Knowing That Everything Is Taken Care Of.  All The Staff  From The Front Door To The Front Desk To The Restaurant Are Unfailingly Polite  Friendly And Helpful.  It's Also A Genuine Pleasure To Be Recognised And Greeted Whenever I Return To The Hotel. ,,,,,
,1375,Fantastic Stay At The Arch - A Very Important Night For Me - I Proposed To My Girlfriend (She Said Yes!). The Entire Team At The Arch Were Amazing And Sourced Flowers  Candles  Chocolates And Champagne. We Felt That Everyone Made Every Effort To Make Our Special Stay Perfect. Thank You!!!

If I Had One Suggestion For The Future It Would Be To Have A Spare Iphone 5 Charger Available To Guests - I (Stupidly) Forgot To Bring A Charger And It Meant That It Limited Our Ability To Call Friends & Family To Tell Them The News.,,,,,
,1377,A Real Pleasure. Beautifully Finished Property And Lovely Room With Nice Extra Touches. Of Particular Note Was The Service Level And Degree Of Team Work.,,,,,
,1378,Good Experience  Thank You,,,,,
,1379,We Had A Wonderful Time. Staff Were Helpful From The Onset And Welcoming. The Hotel Was Conveniently Located To Oxford St And Hyde Park. It Was Very Clean And Quiet. A Great Experience And Definitely Recommend The Hotel. Thank You For A Pleasant And Memorable Stay.,,,,,

Comfortable Room
Design,,,,,
,1385,Delightful,,,,,
,1386,Great As Always ,,,,,
,1387,We Had A Wonderful Stay At The Arch. It Really Made Our Experience In London Special. We Loved Every Moment At The Hotel. The Staff Were Very Attentive And All Had Excellent Customer Service. We Particularly Loved The Breakfast Offer. We Found The Service And The Quality Of The Food At An Exceptional Level. The Interiors Were Warm And Inviting  Just As Hotel Should Be. ,,,,,
,1389,There Was A Definite Difference Between The Service Level Staying At A Weekend V's During The Week Which I Havent Experienced Before.  Following My Weekend Stay I May Not Have Used The Hotel In Future  However I Had A Pre Booked Stay A Few Days Later Mid Week Which Reaffirmed The Arch Experience I Anticipated And Expected,,,,,
,1390,Convenient. The Value This Time Was Good Too.,,,,,
,1392,Superior Yet  Cosy Well Localted Hotel. Excellent Personnel.,,,,,
,1394,Excellent Service  Great Room (It Was Quiet  Which Is So Rare In A London Hotel)  Friendly  Great Food. Can't Fault It (And I Can Usually Fault Hotels!),,,,,
,1395,Good. Met My Expectations  But Too Expensive To Stay Longer Periods.,,,,,
,1396,Special All Staff Were So Customer Focused And Genuinely Cared About Guests Will Definitely Return.
The Only Hitch Was Not Having The Required Twin Beds However Being Sisters It Did Not Spoil Our Stay.,,,,,
,1398,Superb Room  Amenities  Staff And Service. The Best Example Was When We Called Early Sunday Morning For Breakfast And It Wasn't A Problem Even Given The Early Hour. That Was Greatly Appreciated.,,,,,
,1399,Calm  Stylish  Discreet  Welcoming And First Class. ,,,,,
,1401,Just A Very Pleasent Experience.,,,,,
,1404,Nice Rooms But Had Curdled Milk In Fridge And Had To Request Room To Be Cleaned When Arriving Back At 3:30  So A Bit Disappointed,,,,,
,1405,Very Clean  Lovely Quality In The Room And The Free Soft Drinks Were A Pleasant Extra. The Staff Were Friendly And Polite And I Will Look Forward To Staying Again  Thanks. ,,,,,
,1407,Excellent  An Enjoyable Experience ,,,,,
,1408,Comfortable ,,,,,
,1409,Ok,,,,,
,1410,The Hotel Is Wonderful. The Only Problem I Had This Time Is The Room On The Lower Ground Floor: The Bathroom Had No Window And It  Was Unpleasant Also To Open A Window In The Room. Also Had Some Difficulties With The Wi Fi And Phone Reception Downstairs. Next Time - Another Floor. But Again - The Hotel And The Room Is Very Good.,,,,,
,1411,Very Friendly  Helpful Staff. Good Breakfast. Comfortable Room.,,,,,
,1412,I Book The  Arch Regularly For Our Vip Guests And They Are Always Very Pleased With The Service And The Hotel. As A Booker  I Always Find Michelle And The Team To Be Most Professional And Helpful,,,,,
,1413,By Far The Most Incredible Stay I Have Ever Had In Any Hotel  Absolutely Perfect,,,,,
,1414,Excellent Service And Quality. From The Minute We Arrived At The Front Door To The Minute We Left.
Thank You,,,,,
,1415,1St Class Service  1St Class Accommodation  1St Class Breakfast. I Love Everything About Your Hotel.,,,,,
,1416,Overall As Usual The Level Of Service Is Excellent. I Did Feel Though That The Restaurant Service Seems Disorganised  Which Is Perplexing As You Seem To Have A Lot Of Staff In There.,,,,,
,1417,Very Good But Small Room  Chocolate Is Not Good,,,,,
,1418,Exceptional,,,,,
,1419,It Was Really Good To Choose The Arch Hotel  And That Can. Be Showed When I Booked For 2 Times In My Trip Because  I Was In London And I Stayed In Your Hotel And Then I Went To France And Came Back Again To London And Booked The Same Hotel Again .  ,,,,,
,1421,I Very Much Enjoy Staying At The Arch  The Staff Are Friendly The Beds Comfortable And The Location Is Great!,,,,,
,1422,I Am Becoming Quite A Fan Of The Arch. The Location  The Rooms  The Exceptionally Friendly Yet Professional Service  Attention To Detail Make It A Real Delight To Visit. A "Home Away From Home" Type Of Experience. ,,,,,
,1423,Excellent. ,,,,,
,1424,Very Comfortable.

,1443,Exellent In Every Way!,,,,,
,1445,Nice Hotel With A Cosy Atmosphere. High Levels Of Standards And Service. The Breakfast (Continental) Was Maybe A Bit Simple Without Any Warm Food  But Nice Enough. ,,,,,
,1446,Amazing Hotel. The Nespresso Machine  Free Minibar And Tv Over The Bathtub Is A Great Touch  And Certainly Makes You Stand Out From The Crowd.
Service Is Flawless.
Rooms Are Comfortable  Though Not Spacious (But We Understand Why).
Overall A Lovely Experience  Will Be Back. Thank You!,,,,,

,1456,I Thought The Arch London Was A Beautifully Unique  Boutique Hotel With Stunning Interiors And Facilities - I Most Definitely Will Stay With You Again.,,,,,
,1457,As For A Business Traveler  The Time You Spend At A Hotel Is Very Reduced  Therefore It Is Indeed Very Important That Everything Is Well Taken Care Of. This Was Absolutely The Case. Big Compliment For The Staff From The Bar And The Concierge.,,,,,

,1389,The Ability To Bid To Upgrade Became Confusing At Point Of Check In  As I Had Done This For One Nights Stay And The Other Nights Stay Was An 'Upgrade Based On Availability' As Part Of The Package.  It Wasnt Available For Both Nights So We Didnt Bother.  But Were Upgraded Mid Week With None Of The Above On The Booking,,,,,
,1390,It Would Be Nice As A Returning Visitor To Receive An Upgrade Or Similar,,,,,
,1394,No - Everything Was Excellent And I Will Certainly Recommend The Arch.

I Tend To Stay In London 1-2 Times Every Week On Business And Will Try To Stay At The Arch Whenever I Can.,,,,,
,1396,No Staff Were So Helpful And Efficient,,,,,
,1398,Useful Pre-Arrival Email With Upgrade Options  Nice Upsell.,,,,,
,1413,Extremely Helpful And Informative,,,,,
,1415,All Done Smoothly.  Staff Are Very Well Trained And Professional/Courteous,,,,,

,1422,No  Not Really. Keep Up The Good Work. ,,,,,
,1423,Nope.,,,,,
,1432,Everyone Was Very Helpful And Courteous.,,,,,
,1437,The Only (Small) Point To Mention Is I Am A Member Of Thr Slh Club (75668557) But When Making My Booking (Booking.Com) I Did Not Realise You Were An Slh Hotel. If I Had Of Known I Would Have Made The Reservation Through The Membership Team In Order To Contiune Building Up My Membership Benefits (I'm Working Towards Loved Membership).

,1280,Small Room ,,,,,
,1281,Our Tv Crashed Twice Over A 5 Day Stay.,,,,,
,1285,A Little Small But Very Comfortable. Nespresso Machine Was A Nice Touch. ,,,,,
,1286,There Was No Toothbrush
Pillows Were Too Soft,,,,,
,1290,309 I Was Alone  But It Would Be Too Small For 2 People,,,,,
,1293,One Of Us Was Lucky Enough To Be Upgraded And That Suite Was Fantastic ,,,,,
,1295,See Earlier Comment. I Personally Do Not Enjoy Rooms Heavily Scented (Or Scented At All) With Air Fresheners  Perfumes  Or Other Products. ,,,,,
,1297,The Air Conditioning Did Not Seem To Ever Turn Off?  I'm Not Sure If This Is A European Setting? But Normally Once The Temperature Is Reached The Air Conditioning Would Shut Off  But I Had To Manually Turn On And Off For Desired Temperature.,,,,,
,1301,No,,,,,
,1302,N/A,,,,,
,1306,306: No Real Bother Although We Have Been Staying For  A Few Years Now  Except That The Curtain Had Something Splashed Up It-Maybe A Drink? You May Want To Check.,,,,,
,1310,We Were In 306 And It Was Very Good,,,,,
,1313,318 - We Were Given A Complmentary Upgrade To This Junior Suite  The Accommodation Was Excellent,,,,,
,1314,I Found The Room Extremely Comfortable  And The Facilities Excellent.  It Had A Lovely Ambience And I Could Have Stayed Longer!,,,,,
,1322,Room 206  Last Weekend. I Would Just Like To Say The Temperature Control System  Again For People Who Aren't Up-To-Date With The Latest Technology  It Can Be Confusing. 1  2 Or 3 Fans & A Thermometer  If There Was A Little Guide On The Desk As To How It Works That Would Be Ideal.,,,,,
,1323,No Road Noise,,,,,
,1327,Dimmer For The Light Would Be Nice,,,,,
,1329,214 I Think.
Well Appointed Room - Not Especially Spacious But A Very Good Use Of Space.  ,,,,,
,1331,222. One Of The Best!!!,,,,,
,1336,Stunning Room! Loved The Size Of The Bed As I Was Sharing With My Colleague! ,,,,,
,1337,106 Was Extremely Small Compare To Other Rooms We Had Booked. I Constantly Tripped Over The Chair And The Bathroom Door Didn't Open Completely Which Caused Hitting The Sink Every Time.,,,,,
,1339,215 - Please Can I Live At Your Hotel?!?! :),,,,,
,1341,Na ,,,,,
,1343,Room 508 Just A Note: It Took Me A While To Understand That No Sky Hd Channel Was Available Which Was No Big Deal But Either It Needs Fixing Or Maybe An Explanation So One Does Not Try Hd Channels.,,,,,
,1344,Room 212. Lovely Touch With The Nespresso Machine And Use Of A Tea Pot.  The Only Problem Was Lack Of A Bottle Opener / Corkscrew So We Could Have Any Of The Soft Drinks.,,,,,
,1347,Beautiful Room  Bathrooms Are Very Impressive,,,,,
,1350,There Was An Incident In The Morning Of The 13Th Around 7:30 Am When The Fire Or Smoke Alarm In My Room Went Off.
I Panicked And Tried To Call The Front Desk But Line Was Engaged. 
Probably Due To Other Guests Calling For The Same Incident.
I Forced Myself To Wake Up And Leave My Room As Quickly As Possible.
,,,,,
,1351,It Seemed That The Climate Control Temperature Didn't Have Much Affect - So It Was Either "Off" Or "On". The Nespresso Machine Was Also Non-Functional.  I Did Not Notify The Front Desk Though  Because It Wasn't That Big Of A Deal To Me. ,,,,,
,1352,A Huge Room Enabled Me To Work With Clothing Samples Well.,,,,,
,1357,The Lighting In The Room I Was In Was Very Dim Making It Difficult To Work On The Room
,,,,,
,1358,202 There Seem To Be A Lot Of Noise In The Morning Between 7.30 And 9.00 Am  Considering We Were Tucked Away  It May Well Of Been Customers. We Are Quite Relaxed And So Problems.,,,,,
,1359,Very Nice Bed Linen.,,,,,
,1362,515 - Not All The Toiletries I Normally Have In My Room Were Available This Time. Next To This I Find The Internet Speed Very Low/Weak  This Makes Comfortable Working Very Hard. ,,,,,
,1368,Sometimes The Aircon Noise Is Very Loud.,,,,,
,1369,510 We Had Cigarette Smoke Coming Through The Bathroom Vent. No One Was Able To Do Anything About This  So We Blocked The Vent With A Towel And Solved The Problem. You Have To Do Something About This  As This Is Very Unpleasant.,,,,,
,1372,The Rooms Are Always Way Too Hot And The Aircon Is Noisey,,,,,
,1374,I Believe I Stayed In Room 307.  Everything Was Perfect  Except For Some Difficulties With Internet Access In The Room As Well As Other Points In The Hotel - Internet Speed Was Compromised By A Weak-Ish Signal.,,,,,
,1380,509 The Wooden Floor Looks Slippery And Would Be Better If Carpet Could Be Provided To Avoid Fall By Any Guest.,,,,,
,1383,516. I Liked The Room Very Much. The Size Is Good  There Is Plenty Of Room To Stash My Stuff (Which Isn't Always The Case). 
Despite That The Room Faces The Street  It Was Not Too Loud.,,,,,
,1384,104: No,,,,,
,1387,We Stayed In Room 502  Which Was Lovely. We Were Given An Upgrade On Check In. I Was Little Surprised That This Room Was An Upgrade Only Because Of Its Size. The Room Was Very Comfortable  The Bed Especially So. I Would Love To Be Able To Recreate The Bed For Home! ,,,,,
,1389,The Most Disappointing Thing About Our Stay Was That There Were Condoms And Wrappers Directly Outside Our Bedroom Window  Which Faced The Back Of The Property On The Roof Below.  These Were Obviously From A  Previous Guest Throwing Them Out Of A Window.  However In The Three Days We Were Residents In The Hotel These Were Not Removed Which I Feel Is A Very Negative Reflection On The Hotel And Certainly Not What Is Expected From A Luxury Establishment.,,,,,
,1390,405. As The Room Is Very Small  I Found The Work Area A Little Too Small To Work Well.  
Main Thing Was I Didn't Sleep Well  Part Of The Problem Was The Duvet Was Too Warm Which Meant I Needed The Ac On Quite High Which Meant The Room Was Cold.,,,,,
,1394,No - Very Nice Room. ,,,,,
,1396,No,,,,,
,1398,The Walk In Shower Was Great  Water Pressure And Temperature Control Excellent  Quality Of Linen Excellent.,,,,,
,1413,Incredible,,,,,
,1414,Room 203 - A Little On The Small Side For An Executive Double But Otherwise Lovely,,,,,
,1415,Only A Tiny Issue...The Power Cable Had Dropped Out Of The Tv  So Took Me A Couple Of Monutes To Work That Out  Locate It And Plug It Back In.  Didn't Affect My Stay In A Negative Way.,,,,,
,1417,Internet A Bit Slow,,,,,
,1419,No,,,,,
,1422,Actually  One Small Thing. The Iphone Docking Station Had The "Old" Connector  And My Iphone 5 Didn't Fit... 
I Really Liked The Aircon  Quiet And Efficient - This Is Very Rare!,,,,,
,1425,Internet Is Very Slow,,,,,
,1429,Great Quality Products. Bed Truly Comfortable,,,,,
,1430,Juniper On The Last Couple Of Days The Sink Was Starting To Get Clogged Up,,,,,
,1433,No,,,,,
,1437,The Tv In The Bath Was A Really Great Touch.,,,,,
,1439,008 Was Lovely ,,,,,
,1441,Mattress Was Very Saggy  Laid Through- Internet Was Not Working But This Was Discussed With Staff And Fixed By Monday,,,,,
,1449,510 Twere Was Some Noice Fr.O.M. Ari Condition.,,,,,
,1451,Abbey And I'd Stay In This Room Again..,,,,,
,1455,I Reported To Reception That The Handle Of The Hairdryer Was Broken.,,,,,
,1456,Again  The Above Sums My Sentiments Up Fully.,,,,,
,1457,011  Noise From The Door Outside While Opening/Closing With A Little Bit Disturbing.,,,,,

,1285,Bery Friendly. ,,,,,
,1306,Is It A Conscious Decision Not To Have Noodles Of Some Sort On The Menu? Having Travelled And Stayed In Hotels A Lot One Does Get Fed Up With The Nasi Goreng Or Singapore Noodles  But Some Sort Of Light Noodle Dish Might Be Worth Considering. Strawberry Pud Marvellous And No-One Can Beat Your Porridge. ,,,,,
,1322,Room Service Was Extremely Prompt & Very Professional Waitress - Asking If You Want Your Dessert With Your Meal Or Shortly After. I Feel There Could Be A Little More Choice In Room Service Menu  As With A Lot Of Other London 5* Hotels They Have A Bigger Menu  And A Much Bigger Dessert Menu Which Would Help Massively. The Food On All Three Occassions I Dined Was Of Good Quality  Burger & The Fondant Were Lovely. However Portion Of Chips Slightly Small And Cold On Both Occasions.,,,,,
,1331,No ,,,,,
,1336,Very Good Club Sandwich!,,,,,
,1339,The Waitress That Brought Our Order Up To The Room Was Very Polite  And Was In And Out  There Was No Hanging Around Which Was Great.,,,,,
,1347,Very Timely And Polite,,,,,
,1350,I Ordered For A Plain Cheese Sandwich.
When I Started To Eat The Sandwich  There Was Hardly Any Cheese In It.
I Also Requested For A Glass Of Ice Cubes As I Could Not Drink Anything Without It.
The Person Who Took My Room Service Call Promised He Will Send Me A Glass Of Ice Cubes But To My Dismay It Never Came With My Food.
The Only Reason I Ate The Sandwich Is Because I Was Starving But I Was Not Really Satisfied Overall.,,,,,
,1354,Efficient And Courteous,,,,,
,1355,Very Efficient  Punctual And Good Quality.,,,,,
,1374,A Slightly Wider Choice Of The Simple Menu Selections Would Be Very Welcome.,,,,,
,1379,Thank You We Had A Great Time,,,,,
,1380,Satisfactory,,,,,
,1383,Perfectly Adequate.,,,,,
,1384,Room 104
The First Breakfast Delivery Was Better Than The Second. In Fact Il Lacked Butter  Pepper  Salt  Powder Sugar  Jam In Yogurt. And It Was More Expensive.,,,,,
,1389,We Had Issues With The Accuracy Of The Items We Had Ordered On Two Occasions Which Were Rectified But It Was Frustrating.  It Became A Running Joke That As Per The Breakfast Room Service Menu  The Food Can Come 15 Minutes Either Side Of The Time You Ordered.  On All 5 Times We Got Room Service It Came 15 Minutes Early So We Jokingly Started To Order Accordingly!,,,,,
,1390,I Ordered The Porridge Breakfast.  Was Told It Would Be 30 Mins Yet It Arrived Within 10.  Was An Excellent Breakfast And Not Too Expensive.  Will Order Again.,,,,,
,1396,We Actually Ate In The Restaurant Post Theatre Staff Were Exceptional As Was Our Welcome Cocktail .,,,,,
,1398,Very Good Quality For A Room Service Menu. The Tray Had All The Condiments I Might Have Needed (And More). For Your Standard Of Hotel  Good Value For Money.,,,,,
,1419,You Have An Amazing Kitchen 
And Pizza,,,,,

,1394,No - I'll Come Back To The Bar One Evening. It Looked Lovely. Unfortunately  We'd Already Booked Drinks And Dinner Somewhere Else.,,,,,

,1374,All The Staff Of The Restaurant  Led By The Duty Managers  For Going Out Of Their Way To Engage In A More Personal Manner  And For Always Being Unobtrusively Attentive.,,,,,
,1377,Actually What Was Noticeable Was How Well The Front Of House Team Worked As A Team And It Was Nice To See The Duty Manager Act As Concierge When He Was Busy Collecting Clients Cars. Gave A Great Quality Service Feeling.,,,,,
,1379,The Lovely Lady Who Helped Me To The Room At Check In. I Cant Remember Her Name But She Was Professional And Welcoming.,,,,,

,1457,If I Remember Correctly  Eric  A Reception Staff Member Needs To Improve Service  As He Seems To Take Himself For More Important Than The Guest. He Did My Check In  I Felt Very Exhausted (I As Well Looked Like This) And Needed A Calm And Nice  Attentive And Understanding Check In  Which Unfortunately Wasn't The Case. I Felt Uncomfortable.

For The Positive Part: Your Italian Bar Tender And Your Events/Sales/Operations Manager (He Is Quite A Talent) Were Very Nice And Friendly.,,,,,

,1288,Nothing At All Thank You So Much For Another Great Stay,,,,,
,1296,See Prior Comments,,,,,
,1301,No,,,,,
,1302,N/A,,,,,
,1303,Nothing That I Am Aware Of.,,,,,
,1306,You Need To Make Sure You Have Returning Guests' Birthdays From Their Passports So That It Pops Up If They Stay For Their Birthday.,,,,,
,1313,Not Really - We Are Experienced Travellers And Have Stayed In A Number Of Hotels And Clubs In London Over The Last 15 Years. The Arch Provides Exactely What We Require And Would Not Consider Staying Anywhere Else If This Standard Is Maintained.,,,,,
,1321,Ensured The Restaurant Was Properly Laid For Breakfast  We Were Sat At An Unlaid Table Which Is Fine But The Entire Breakfast Was Spent Asking For Things  That Should Already Be On The Table Such As Side Plates  Glasses  Salt And Pepper Etc.  The Waiter Who Sat Us Was Not Very Customer Friendly With His Attitude And Everything That You Asked For Was An Effort For Him.  That Said The Female Manager On The Day When She Came Into The Room Was Very Good And Was Much More What You Expect At The Arch ,,,,,
,1322,Just A Few Little Things Such As A More Extensive Room Service Menu  The Temp Of Some Of The Food Items. As Well As A Guide On How To Use The Air-Con/Room Temperature Guage. And More Welcome Packs On The Desk With A Room Service Number. Also Temperature Of The Fridge In Room 206 Might Need To Be Looked At  My Milk Curdled A Few Hours After I Received It.,,,,,
,1329,No ,,,,,
,1331,No,,,,,
,1336,None,,,,,
,1339,Nothing.  Your Hotel Is Beautiful And Your Staff Worked 100% All Of The Time!,,,,,
,1340,Improve The Wi Fi Internet Speed,,,,,
,1341,Na ,,,,,
,1345,Salsa Lessons  Or Live Music Would Be Excellent (In The Library?),,,,,
,1347,Not At All  The Whole Team Exceeded Any High Standards I Have Previously Experienced,,,,,
,1350,Improve Room Service And Food Quality.
And To Please Listen To Guests' Requests.
Please Do Not Promise If They Cannot Deliver,,,,,
,1352,No,,,,,
,1354,None At All  Apart From Driving Us Home (Only Joking) ,,,,,
,1358,No,,,,,
,1359,No,,,,,
,1367,Only One Comment  No Biggie  But I Would Prefer Water Without Lemon Togehter With Wine!,,,,,
,1370,No,,,,,
,1372,Doors Slam Throughout The Hotel These Could Be Improved Particularly When Sleeping In Certain Rooms,,,,,
,1375,Perhaps Have Spare Iphone 5 Chargers Available To Be Used By Guests As I Stupidly Forgot Mine And Couldn't Charge My Phone,,,,,
,1376,Perhaps The Breakfast Choice Could Be A Little Bit Improved With Including In The Choice Some Pancakes For Example For Children Or Some Eggs Without Additionnal Fee...,,,,,
,1380,Maintain The Standard And Improve,,,,,
,1383,No.,,,,,
,1384,No,,,,,
,1387,No  We Really Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,
,1389,As Previously Mentioned  The Customer Service Experience On A Weekend Compared To A Week Day Was Noticeably Different.  If I Wasnt A Previous Guest And Didnt Have A Follow Up Stay Mid Week  I Would Have Thought That The Standard Of The Hotel Had Deteriorated From My Previous Stays.,,,,,
,1390,You Knew I Was A Returning Visitor  I Think I Could Have Been Made To Feel A Little More Special.

I Will Return Though.,,,,,
,1394,No,,,,,
,1395,Up Grade Me To A Bigger Room As This Was My Third Or Fourth Stay There In Less Than 2 Years,,,,,
,1396,No ,,,,,
,1398,Honestly No  For A Single Night Stay I Would Recommend It.,,,,,
,1410,Only My Remark About The Lower Ground Floor,,,,,
,1413,No,,,,,
,1415,Can't Think Of Anything...,,,,,
,1417,Better Internet  Bigger Room  Better Chocolate,,,,,
,1418,No,,,,,
,1419,No,,,,,
,1422,No,,,,,
,1424,The Offer Of A Room Upgrade Was Great  But A Little Expensive. 
Room Upgrades In Us Are Usually Complimentary Providing The Customer Is A Frequenter Of The Hotel Or Part Of Rewards Program. Apologies If This Is The Case  But I Wasn't Aware Of It. ,,,,,
,1427,Not At All - Thoroughly Enjoyed My Stay As Always And Am Back In November But Just For One Night.   Looking Forward To It. ,,,,,
,1429,No. All Was Perfect,,,,,
,1432,Not A Thing  Thank You.,,,,,
,1436,No,,,,,
,1437,Honestly No - I Would Certainly Stay Here Again At The Next Opportunity. ,,,,,
,1442,Nothing At All!,,,,,
,1451,No Not Really..,,,,,
,,,,,,,

,----------------------,,,,,,
,1281,No,,,,,
,1282,I Would Gladly Recommend The Arch And Look Forward To Staying There Again On My Next Visit...( And The One After That If I Win The Drawing!!!),,,,,
,1283,I've Said It All Above.,,,,,
,1285,No. ,,,,,
,1289,We Found The Arch Ideally Located  And Within Easy Reach Of The Places And Areas That Interested Us During Our Short Stay  The Close Proximity Of The Underground Station Was Very Convenient.,,,,,
,1290,The Continental Breakfast Should Be Included In The Room Price,,,,,
,1301,No,,,,,
,1302,N/A,,,,,
,1303,Thank You.,,,,,
,1311,I'm Just Sorry We Didn't Have A Chance To Have Breakfast With You -- I Understand That It's Great! Next Time.,,,,,
,1313,Looking Forward To Our Visit In October.,,,,,
,1314,I Have Since Recommended The Arch  And Do Hope To Be Able To Get Back There Soon.,,,,,
,1320,I Have Stayed With You Many Times And Each Time You Have An Expected "High Occupancy" You Try And Charge Me A Much Higher Rate.  I Don't Believe That A Good Customer Should Be Punished For Their Loyalty.,,,,,
,1323,Turn Down Service Was Good With Additonal Water,,,,,
,1327,Mistake On The Bill For Beverages At The Hunter Restaurant,,,,,
,1329,I Did A Search For A Future Personal Stay And The Tarrif Looks Expensive. 
Some Form Of Voucher / Token System To Translate A Business Stay To A Leisure / Personal Stay Would Be A Good Idea. ,,,,,
,1330,I Didn't Stay With You. I Cancelled My Reservation  This Was Confirmed By You. Yet You Still Charged Me! Receiving This Survey Confirms My Fear That Your Administrative Procedures Need Some Attention.  ,,,,,
,1331,No,,,,,
,1336,This Is Our New Favourite London Hotel!,,,,,
,1340,Good Luck ,,,,,
,1341,Na ,,,,,
,1345,It's Always A Pleasure Staying At The Arch - It's My Favourite Hotel In London  If Not The World.,,,,,
,1347,Thank You To You And Your Staff For Making My Partner's Birthday So Very Special. We Were Looked After In An Exceptional Manner.,,,,,
,1350,None,,,,,
,1351,Great Place. ,,,,,
,1352,The Staff Are Always Patient When We Take Over The Reception Area With Packing & Repacking Our Final Items For Long Haul Flights After Shopping For The Day.,,,,,
,1353,A Great Hotel In A Superb Location With Wonderful Staff.,,,,,
,1354,Well Done 5 Star All Round,,,,,
,1355,Best Affordable Hotel In London.,,,,,
,1356,Housekeeping Likes To Leave The Windows Open After They Have Cleaned The Room...,,,,,
,1359,Mo,,,,,
,1362,I Stayed Several Times Already. Because We Have A Corporate Rate With The Arch  I Don't Collect Any Rewards From Slh. It Would Be Extremely Comfortable And Convenient To Have A Frequent Traveller Arrangements With The Arch. With Such A Program It Would Be Possible To Earn Points/Vouchers For Free Nights  Etc. I Can Use For A Personal Stay In Your Hotel. ,,,,,
,1364,Only Negative Comment Is The Price - This Is Not A Cheap Hotel By Any Stretch Of The Imagination.  ,,,,,
,1367,100% - We'll Be Back :),,,,,
,1371,The Hotel Provided A Wooden Cot For Our Son. This Appeared To Have Been Recently Stained/Varnished And This Came Off Over Him  Which He Ingested. Thankfully There Were No Ill Effects Although It Was Extremely Difficult To Remove From His Skin. The Hotel Were Apologetic  Removed The Cot Acquired A New One And Replaced (Although It Took Considerable Effort For Them To Erect). Whilst The Hotel Did Take Immediate Action I Felt That With A Little Forethought The Whole Incident Could Easily Have Been Avoided.,,,,,
,1372,Doorman Is Always Very Elpful Friendly,,,,,
,1380,Your Team Is Fantastic And Must Be Motivated To Do More,,,,,
,1383,Nothing That Has Not Been Already Covered.,,,,,
,1384,No,,,,,
,1389,All The Basics Are There  But The Staff Need To Get Slicker To Be Able To Keep Their Service Standards Up When The Hotel Is Full.  All These Different Options To Upgrade Need To Be Reviewed As Its Confusing And Fristrating As A Guest.  ,,,,,
,1394,No. It Was My Birthday And You Made It A Great Experience. Thank You.,,,,,
,1396,No ,,,,,
,1415,Keep Up The Good Work!,,,,,
,1419,No,,,,,
,1420,Great Hotel With Great Staff As I've Come To Expect From The Arch - Thank You. ,,,,,
,1421,Great Hotel And Great People!,,,,,
,1422,Looking Forward To Staying Again Soon. ,,,,,
,1424,Super Hotel!,,,,,
,1432,Have Already Recommended To A Friend And Will Hopefully Be Back As Well.,,,,,
,1440,Rates Remain Challenging,,,,,
,1449,Everything Was Verk Good.,,,,,
,1451,No Not Really,,,,,
,1454,Housekeeping Were Very Flexible With Laundry Times. Thanks!,,,,,
,1455,I Love Staying At The Arch And Will Be Back In A Few Weeks Again Hope! ,,,,,
,1457,Quite A House Number In The Very Posh Area Of Marble Arch. You Are Doing A Great Job  Keep It Up. Thank You.,,,,,
