,5467,Booked Stay In December Via Credit Card As A Surprise For My Sister's 60Th Birthday. Received A Phone Call From Reception 3 Days Before Arrival Stating That The Orangery And Club House Wern't Available. Find This Very Disappointing As Booking Was Non-Refundable And Grossly Limited Dining Choice For A 5 Star Hotel. ,,,,,

,5438,There Was An Infection Of Flies In The Sealed Light In The Bathroom  Room Was Dusty And Glass Table Was So Streaky You Couldnt See Through It  ,,,,,
,5441,Lovely Apart From Would Not Bring Children Next Time - Not Set Up To Have Kids There At All.  Would Benefit With Some Kind Of Kids Area.  Husbands Were Playing Golf So We Were Left To Entertain Them For 5 Hours Which Was Fairly Difficult In A Hotel Like This - Although If You Don't Want To Encourage Children Then It Is Fine How It Is.,,,,,
,5442,Lovely Experience. Had A Relaxing Time In The Spa. Food Was Fantastic  Bedrooms  Relaxing & Very Comfortable. All Staff Friendly. Def Be Back. Thanks For A Great Weekend Which Was A Treat For My Mums Birthday. :-) ,,,,,
,5443,Great Stay With A Couple Of Niggles,,,,,
,5444,I Found My Stay Very Relaxing Our Suite Was Lovely. My Partner And I Had A Very Nice Meal In The Orangery. The Best Part Of My Stay Was My Indian Head Massage This Was My First Ever Treatment And I Was Very Nervous But Abigail Made Me Feel At Ease And The Massage Was Great I Will Definitely Be Returning To The Spa And Hopefully The Hotel. Thank You Rockliffe.,,,,,
,5446,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,5448,Hotel Maintained To High Standard Every Time I Stay.,,,,,
,5450,Always Enjoyable. The Staff Are Faultless. However We Found A Few Very Minor Negatives Compared To Our Previous Visits. 
-We Found The Spa To Be Cold On This Visit Or At Least Not As Hot And Enjoyable As Last Time. It Was Still Spotless And Clean And The Staff Very Attentive.
- We Found Our Room To Be Quite Dusty
- The Bathroom Had A Very Suttle But Still Evident Smell Of Damp. 

These Very Minor Problems Are Not Enough For Us To Complain And Would Not Prevent Us From Returning Again As We Love To Visit Rockliffe Hall. 
Please Praise The Staff As They Are Always Fantastic,,,,,
,5452,Northern Luxury,,,,,
,5453,Satisfactory But Suite Was Freezing When We Checked In And Therefore Took An Hour To Warm.  This Did Affect Our Initial Enjoyment.,,,,,
,5454,5 Star Excellence,,,,,
,5455,Excellent Overall Standard Of Facilities And Totally Attentive Staff. ,,,,,
,5456,Fantastic,,,,,
,5457,Good Experience  Although A Few Small Changes Could Make It Excellent,,,,,
,5459,Beautiful Surroundings  And The Best Spa Facilities By Far Compared To All Other 5Star Spa Hotels We Have Stayed At. ,,,,,
,5460,Staff Were Too Professional  Friendliness Did Not Seem Sincere.  Spa Lacked Atmosphere.  Breakfast In Room Was Cold.  Food In Bistro Was Delicious And Room Was Lovely.  I Came On A Winter Special Deal.  Would Not Pay Full Price.  ,,,,,
,5463,Welcoming  Relaxing  Luxurious,,,,,
,5465,Never Been So Relaxed In My Whole Life. ,,,,,
,5466,Remains Excellent,,,,,
,5467,Have Stayed At The Rockcliffe A Few Times With My Husband And Always Throughly Enjoyed My Stay. Feel Extremely Disappointed Obviously Less Staff Lacking In Attention To Detail No Choice Of Dining Areas Small Dining Tables No Table Clothes  Felt As Though The Hotel Was In The Middle Of Change But This Should Not Be Reflected Onto The Customers,,,,,
,5469,Fantastic Experience In A Luxury Spa Hotel With First Class Staff.,,,,,
,5473,Good  A Very Comfortable Luxurious Hotel. Not Totally Maintaining Its Early Standard But Still Head And Shoulders Above Anything Else Available In The Area,,,,,
,5474,Had An Excellent Time ,,,,,
,5475,The Experience Was Once Again Excellent Overall But The Shine Was Somewhat Taken Off Our Stay By The Overly Long Waits In Between Some Of The Courses At Our Dinner In The Orangery On Saturday Evening. We Were Told When Ordering Of The Launch Of The New Menu & How The Restaurant Had Been Closed For 4 Nights For Preparations. The Menu Looked Very Good & It All Tasted Exquisite. Our Only Issue Was That Twice We Had To Wait Almost Half An Hour Between Two Of The 5 Courses  We Didn't Get Onto Dessert Until 11Pm! We Had Booked Our Table For 7.30 & Even Though We Didn't Sit Down Until Just After 8 This Was Too Long. It Looked Pretty Clear That The Serving Staff Were Aware Of The Delays. Launching A New Menu Is Obviously A Major & Exciting Task But I Feel The First Night Or Two Should Not Have Been Tested On Full Paying Guests  It Was Almost Like We Were Being Used As Guinea Pigs. That In Itself Is Not A Problem As We Enjoy Fine Dining & Experimentation But I Think There Should Have Been Some Concession Until The Food Production Is Fine Tuned. Things Can Go Awry In All Establishments At Times & We Have Seen This Happen In Other 5-Star Establishments - Sometimes It Just Can't Be Helped. What Distinguishes The Best Hotels Is How A Situation Going Wrong Is Dealt With & I Do Believe In This Instance More Could Have Been Done To Explain & Compensate For The Delays. I Did Bring This Issue To The Attendion Of The Lady On The Desk At The Orangery When We Left & To Reception On Checking Out. The New Menu Is Fantastic  The Food Was Tremendous  The Restaurant Staff Were Excellent  Just A Pity The Overall Time It Took Spoiled The Experience Of Such Great Food & Wine. ,,,,,
,5476,Excellent Stay. Only Negative Was Breakfast Was Just Ok. Service Very Good But Waited A Long Time For Cooked Breakfast To Arrive And Not Cooked As Ordered.,,,,,
,5477,Relaxing   Courteous Staff And Excellent Facilities. Pool Seating Now Looking Shabby And Needs Replacing.  ,,,,,
,5479,Absolutely Fabulous But Disappointed With The Food (Explained In More Detail In The Food Section Of The Questionnaire),,,,,

,5437,Cobwebs In All The Lights But Apart From That  All Was Fine Regarding Cleanliness. I Was Surprised How Small The Tv Was For Such A Large Room As We The Bed Was A Long Way From The Tv. Also  A Docking Station To Play Music Would Have Been Nice. Minor Grumbles Really.,,,,,
,5438,There Was An Infection Of Flies In The Sealed Light In The Bathroom  Room Was Dusty And Glass Table Was So Streaky You Couldnt See Through It  I Have Taken Photographs Of The Room,,,,,
,5439,Stayed In Room 214 There Are A Few Broken Floor Tiles Adjacent To The Shower Which Should Be Replaced.,,,,,
,5440,Robe Had Been Previously Used As Found Ticket In Pocket From Last Guest ,,,,,
,5442,I Want To Take The Bed Home!! It's Very Comfortable. ,,,,,
,5443,Bit Dusty  Scrapes On Furniture Ect Nothing Major ,,,,,
,5445,The Air Conditioning Didn't Appear To Be Working So Room Got Hot At Night.,,,,,
,5446,The Bathroom/Wet Areas Under The Basins Looking Worn  Signs Of Mould Around Shower Tray. Not What You Expect For 5 Star.,,,,,
,5448,£10 Charge For Ice And Glasses To Room Is A Disgrace  Other 5 Star Hotel Locally Does Not Charge For This And It Does Make A Difference When Deciding Where To Stay.,,,,,
,5449,Tv In Bathroom Wouldn't Change Channels From The Corporate Video.
Curtains Cover The Radiators Which Make It Hard To Heat The Room.,,,,,
,5453,Temperature Of Suite Was Disappointing On Our Arrival Which Meant We Kept Our Coats In Until It Warmed Up ,,,,,
,5457,Was Impressed With Room Upon Arrival. Struggled To Operate Lights  Too Complicated. Didn't Realise That Main Tv Had To Be On To Operate One In Bathroom  Therefore Didn't Take Advantage As Was Already In Bath.
Would Be Nice To Provide An Aux Cable For Use With Radio So Own Music Can Be Played.
Ended Up Sleeping With Balcony Door Open As Couldn't Get Room To Cool Down Despite Turning On Air Con To Lowest Setting As Soon As I Got Into Room.
Bed Very Comfortable,,,,,
,5459,Very Spacious Apartment ,,,,,
,5462,Damp Smell Also Webs Above Curtains In Bedroom Dust On Fan Shower Head Dirty,,,,,

,5469,Could Have Stayed For Months! Best Ever.  Clean Spacious Fab Views Comfy Bed. Lovely Extra Touches Eg Magazines   Fresh Coffee   Topped Up The Bottled Water,,,,,
,5480,It's Only A Small Thing But The Bin  Had Some Cotton Wipes In That Did Not Belong To Any Of Our  Party  ,,,,,

,5436,Breakfast Poor. Food Was Cold. Menu Choice Could Be Broader. ,,,,,
,5437,You Need A 'N/A' Above As We Did Not Use All Of These Services.,,,,,
,5439,We Had A Few Drinks In The Cocktail Bar. Atmosphere Is More Gentleman's Club Feel  Not An Intimate Place For Couples To Share Drinks.


I Had Treacle Salmon Starter In The Brasserie And Although Beetroot Was The Main Ingredient Of The Dish  Overpowering The Ginger And Lemon Grass  This Was Not Described.     ,,,,,
,5440,Noticed That The The Menus Had At Different Places Had Some Of The Same Things But At Different Prices.  Didn't Like That To Be Honest ,,,,,
,5441,We Have Eaten In The Orangery Before Which Is Lovely (Will Be Better When It Is Michelin Star Though).  This Time As We Had The Children We At Lunch In The Brasserie Which Was Poor To Say The Least.  The Mezze Looked Like A Platter For Children And The Meats Were Not What Was On The Menu.  Dinner In The Clubhouse Was Nice  Steak Wasn't Amazing  I Asked For It Rare Which Usually Would Be Chargrilled On The Outside And Rare On The Inside But It Looked Anaemic!  Soup For Starter Was Delicious.  Breakfast - Bit Disappointed  We Were Waiting From 10.10Am For A Table And Didn't Get Sat Down Until 10.30 And By That Time There Was No Fruit Left And No Croissants Which Wasn't Really Our Fault That We Were Sat Down Late.  English Breakfast Was Nice Though. ,,,,,
,5443,Reading The Website It Suggests All Menus Are Availble In Brasserie What Ever Time You Eat & Special Every Day.  Limited Menu & No Specials On An Evening & No Choice If You Just Want A Light Bite.  Requested A Steak But Chef Would Not Do Anything Off Menu.  Disapointed With Icecream 3 Small Scoops In A Bowl With Syrup Very Expensive.  Both Mane Meals Were Very Nice Also Enjoyed The Bread. ,,,,,
,5444,I Had Egg Shell In My Egg At Breakfast That Did Put Me Off My Food A Little.,,,,,
,5446,Would Prefer Not To Be Sat With Spa Guests In The Brasserie Whilst Eating Afternoon Lunch. This Should Not Be Recommended To Hotel Guests For Something To Eat During The Day.,,,,,
,5449,I Presume From The Speed That The Cooked Breakfast Arrives It Is Pre Cooked - It Certainly Wasn't "Fresh",,,,,
,5455,Seating In Cocktail Bar Lacks Some Intimacy As Seats And Tables Are A Little Difficult To Move Close Together.  ,,,,,
,5457,Buffet Dinner In Clubhouse And Buffet Lunch In Conference Suite. 
Quality Of Food Ok But Not Exceptional. Limited Places To Sit During Lunch So Difficult To Eat! Couldn't Find Any Salt/Pepper/Vinegar.
Green Tea Ran Out Early On First Day And As Far As I Could See Wasn't Replaced.
Small Niggles  Overall Good But Small Improvements Could Make A Big Difference To Overall Impression,,,,,
,5459,Ambience Was Perfect In The Clubhouse During Our Evening Meal. ,,,,,
,5460,See Previous Comment,,,,,
,5465,Very Helpful Staffs,,,,,
,5467,Bar In The Brasserie Had No Change Both  Orangery And Club House Were Closed,,,,,
,5469,Lovely Environment And Helpful Pleasant Staff. Husband Loved All The Food. I'm A Vegetarian And Breakfast Perfect But Suggest Brasserie Consider Wider Menu  For Vegetarians With Several Choices.  To Include More Nutritious And Varied Veggie Food. Happy To Elaborate On Types In Separate Email If You Want. ,,,,,
,5473,It Seems Strange That 2 Out Of 3 Restaurants In The Hotel Would Be Unavailable At The Same Time  Leaving Only One Option. The Breakfast Service In The Orangery Was Good  But Not Up To Previous Standards. The Waitress Was Not Very Welcoming  She Leaned Right Across Us When Placing Things On The Table Rather Than Going Around And Being Less Intrusive.,,,,,
,5475,See Question 8.,,,,,
,5477,Wine And Drinks Overpriced For Quality Of Product. ,,,,,
,5478,We Had The New Menu In The Orangery   Which Was Excellent  But Would Still Like The Option Of A More Traditional Menu,,,,,
,5479,I've Really Had To Mark The Food Down For One Reason  I've Been A Vegetarian For 25 Years And Have Eaten Great Food And Poor Food....I Had High Expectations For Rockcliffe Hall Being A 5 Star Hotel With A Michelin Star Chef (Who I Appreciate Only Cooks In The Orangery But I Believe Overseas The Other Restaurants) And Hoped For Something New And Exciting...We Decided On The Clubhouse Because There Was A Number Of Vegetarian Dishes To Choose From.......The Starter Was Amazing But The Main Was Massively Disappointing! I Birds Eye Veggie Burger Made From Frozen Processed Vegetable In Breadcrumb Is Certainly Not What I Expect From A 5Star Establishment!!  We Did Not Pay For My Main But To Be Honest The More I Think About The More I'm Disappointed.....I Would Love To Hear Back From Your Team That The Processed Dreadful Burger Has Been Taken Off The Menu Completely....Its A Bit Of An Insult To Vegetarians To Think We'd Accept Such Sub Standard Food :( Sorry To Be So Blunt But You Did Ask :/,,,,,

I Was Upset About This. Also As It Was My First Time And A Guest At The Hotel  The Staff Were Not Helpful. Big Difference To The Hotel Where They Were Excellent!,,,,,
