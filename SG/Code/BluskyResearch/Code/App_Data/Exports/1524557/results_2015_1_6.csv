,3832,Took Along Time To Recieve Welcome Drinks Have Been Using Spa Since Opening And Feels As It Had Become More Popular Personal Touch Has Been Lost ,,,,
,3833,The Policy Of Not Reserving Poolside Seats Does Not Work. The Spa Was Very Busy And We Seemed To Be The Only People Who Did Not Leave Towels On Unoccupied Seats.,,,,
,3836,Being A Regular Visitor To Your Spa  Both My Wife And I Are Surprised That You Don't Have A Crm System That Tells You We Have Been Before. Considering G We Use Rockcliff Every 8 Weeks Or So  Everyone Still Asks Us 'Have You Been With Us Before'. ,,,,

,3812,We Were Disappointed That There Were Children Using The Pool  When Visiting Other Spas The Spa Area Was Dedicated To Adult Use At Specified Times. Also The Pool Seating Are Is Very Open  Perhaps A More Relaxing Environment Could Be Achieved By Moving The Pot Plants To Create More Privacy For Those That May Wish To Relax On The Loungers,,,,
,3814,None,,,,
,3815,Would Be Nice For Staff Not To Tidy Dressing Gown Away From Chair While I Was In The Pool. Made Me Feel Uneasy In Case My Towel  Gown And Slippers Were Disposed Of,,,,
,3821,Some Facilities  Especially The Hydro Pool Were Very Busy.,,,,
,3822,Didn't Have The Wow Factor For Five Star. Could Have Been In Any 3/4 Star Hotel. Had Higher Expectations.,,,,
,3823,Yes  My Only Criticism Is Of The Showers In And Around The Pool Areas. The Hot Option Was Too Hot To Be Refreshing And The Cold Option Was Unbearably Cold. Please Provide An Adjustable Temperature Or At Least A Cooler (But Not Freezing) Option For Those Who Want To Cool Off/Refresh After A Sauna.,,,,
,3828,The Facility Is Of A Very High Standard  It Makes For A Very Enjoyable Experience.,,,,
,3829,The Towels Were Not Replenished In The Changing Rooms; We Had To Ask For Towels And When They Eventually Brought The Towels After A Fifteen Minute Wait The Young Girls Did Not Apologise For Our Wait And Just Abruptly Passed Me A Towel.  Also I Think A Better Shampoo And Conditioner Could Be Used In The Showers  As The Shampoo And Conditioner Left My Hair Feeling Dry.,,,,
,3831,The Towels Were Not Replenished In The Changing Rooms And We Had To Ask For These And Waited Fifteen Minutes For These To Arrive  And When They Did There Was No Apology For Our Wait And I Was Just Abruptly Handed A Towel.  Also The Shampoo And Conditioner In The Changing Rooms Left My Hair Feeling Dry  And So Maybe A Different Shampoo And Conditioner Could Be Used In The Showers.,,,,
,3833,One Of The Foot Spas Was Not Working.,,,,
,3835,Hydro Pool Had Limited Access For No Of People And Not All Areas Were Working,,,,
,3836,You Seldom Have Enough Loungers For The Amount Of People At The Spa. We Are Always Having To Sit On Chairs Due To Lack Of Loungers. ,,,,
,3837,Pool Area Quite Busy Would Suggest Extra Loungers Be Provided,,,,
,3838,Ganging Area Messy Clients Not Placing Used Items In Baskets Provided.  Pool Was Rather Chilly On Entering,,,,
,3843,Wonderful Experience,,,,
,3845,No Towels In Changing Rooms.
Nom Plastic Bags For Wet Costumes. 
Not Enough Chairs/Loungers For The Amount If People In Pool. ,,,,
,3849,It Would Be More Helpful To Have Extra Towels Available In The Spa Area Not Just The Changing Rooms ,,,,
,3853,The Hydro Pool Steps Were Dirty And Some Of The Rooms Smelt Of Other People's Sweat (Hot Bed Room Particularly). Some Aromatherapy Fragrances May Have Helped,,,,
,3856,Buy One Get One Free :) ,,,,
,3859,I Think There Could Be A Better Service Around The Pool As It Was Not Staffed All The Time ,,,,
,3860,Did Not Experience The Butler Service,,,,

,3823,My Friends And I Seemed To Have Different Experiences During Our Massages Even Though We Technically Had The Same Treatment. I Was Surprised That My 60 Minute Full Body Massage Did Not Include The Front Of My Shoulders And Décolletage Area  Whereas Theirs Did According To Them. ,,,,

,3812,Both My Friend And I Found The Menu Overly Complicated  A Simple Selection Of Salads Would Be Preferred. I Found The Food Disappointing. The Experience Of Eating Lunch In A Robe Next To Other Guests In Suits Was Somewhat Bizarre. I Had Expected The Entire Spa Area To Be Secluded And For The Use Of Spa Guests Only. ,,,,
,3814,Should Have Been Offered A Welcome Drink With Meal As Part Of Deal But This Was Not Given.,,,,
,3815,No,,,,
,3820,The Brassiere Staff Took A Long Time To Take Our Welcome Drinks Order  We Had Been Seated For Over 30 Mins.  ,,,,
,3825,We Have Eaten In The Brasserie Many Times And Never Found It Less Than Excellent In The Past. The Tapas Menu Did Not Quite Suite Us As Well And We Were A Little Disappointed At Several Of The Meals Arriving With Wilted Salad On The Side.  Staff Were Friendly  Although Forgot Our Coffees!,,,,
,3827,Excellent Afternoon Tea.,,,,
,3828,The Brasserie Was Fairly Busy  The Service Was Good And Could Find No Fault.,,,,
,3829,We Did Not Use The Brasserie On This Occasion But Have Used It In The Past,,,,
,3830,We Have Visited A Few Times And The Menu Hasn't Changed During These Times. It Would Be Nice To Have Something Different. ,,,,
,3831,We Did Not Use The Brasserie For Food On This Occasion  Only Pre Drinks  But Have Eaten In The Brasserie In The Past When Attending A Full Day Spa Experience.,,,,
,3832,Restaurant Busy Items Of Food Ordered Were Missed And Had To Reorder ,,,,
,3836,Hardly Ever Busy And Seldom Attentive. We Wait Ages To Be Asked What We Would Like  Then We Wait Ages For The Bill. ,,,,
,3838,Food Was More Than Excellent,,,,
,3842,We Were Only Allowed One Small Cup Of Coffee.!! Although Described As A Brunch It Was More Like A Breakfast. Limited Choices. A Buffet Would Have Been Better,,,,
,3843,They Went The Extra Mile To Help Me   Very Thoughtful & Caring   Nothing Was A Problem   Credit To The Company ,,,,
,3846,I Did Not Use The Brasserie,,,,
,3848,It Has Been The Same Menu For A While. 
Always A Tad Disappointed With The Dessert  Options,,,,

,3812,I Hope That This Review Does Not Appear Negative  I Did Enjoy My Day But Felt That The Children And Privacy Aspect Made It Difficult To Relax And Derive Full Benefit From The Experience. I Am Aware That Others May Wish To Take Their Children. Maybe Certain Days Or Times Could Be Dedicated For Each To Give All Users Clear Expectations,,,,
,3814,None,,,,
,3815,This Was My Second Time Here And I Was Disappointed That It Didn't Live Up To My Experience The First Time Due To The Issues Mentioned Previously. It Mightn't Sound A Big Deal About Tea/Coffee Not Delivered But It Is When Someone Suffers From Low Blood Sugars,,,,
,3820,The Hydro Pool Was A Little Crowded Which Made It Hard To Relax ,,,,
,3825,We Felt A Little Disappointed By The Brasserie As Have Always Loved Eating Here In The Past. This Will Not Put Us Off Coming Again As The Spa Itself Is So Lovely. ,,,,
