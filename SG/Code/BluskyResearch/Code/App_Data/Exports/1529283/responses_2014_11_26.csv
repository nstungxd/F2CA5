She Persisted In Telling Me That You Do Not Accept Debit Cards Even After I Had Said Twice That I Was Using A Credit Card.  She Asked If I Had Stayed Before And Then Gave An Almost Sarcastic 'Welcome To Sopwell House' When I Said I Had Not Stayed Before.  I Had A Warmer  Nicer And More Helpful Welcome When Staying At A Premier Inn Recently.,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Room 154 Had A Slightly Grubby Feel To It.  It Was Very Small.  There Were No Bathrobes Or Slippers.  The Furniture Had A Cheap Feel About It.  For Example  The Mirror Hanging On The Side Of The Wardrobe Was Not Fully Fixed On And The Bed Was Small.,Yes,,Yes,No,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,I Had To Keep The Tray In My Room After I Had Finished As The Corridor Was So Small It Could Not Be Put Outside.  I Ordered Decaf Coffee With My Breakfast  When It Arrived It Was A Pot Of Hot Water And A Nescafe Sachet Of Decaf.  I Could Have Had That From The Sachets Provided In-Room.  There Was Nothing On The Room Service Menu Card That Indicated Choosing Decaf Meant You Would Get Instant Coffee Instead Of Ground Coffee. It Was Very Disappointing And Not The Standard I Would Expect From This Price Of Hotel. Also  My Husband Had A Full English Breakfast Delivered  The Poached Egg Was Tasteless  The Sausage Burnt And The Bacon So Salty It Was Inedible.,,,,,,,The Brasserie,,,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,Had Breakfast In The Brasserie  There Was An Excellent Choice Of Food.  I Did Have To Get Someone To Toast A Bagel For Me Though  It Would Have Been Good To Have A Toaster To Be Able To Do It Myself As I Waited A While And The Bagel Was Cold By The Time I Got It Back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,We Had A Lady Serving In The Bar Of The Function Room For The Wedding Reception Who Was Kept Very Busy All Night But Still Mainatined A Sense Of Humour.  I Regret That I Did Not Get Her Name. She Was Petite With Glasses And Long Fair Hair.,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Fell Below,On Monday The Staff Were Much Friendlier Than On Saturday Or Sunday.  They Said Good Morning  They Held Open Doors And They Smiled.  Saturday And Sunday Was Not Welcoming At All.,I Hope My Experiences Were A One-Off And Not The Norm.  I Appreciate That Room Sizes Are Not Something You Can Change  But I Did Feel The Standard Was Below That Of Similar Hotels I Have Stayed In.  I Was Forced To Stay In A Premier Inn Recently And The Room Was Larger  Cleaner  Brighter And Had Better Furnishings Than My Room At Sopwell House - At Half The Price.,Female,35-44,,,Anita Barron,anita.barron@gs.com,5/18/2013,5/20/2013,,,,,,,,,,,Please Select The Box

There Was No Pre-Arrival Contact From The Hotel Itself  No Email To Confirm The Booking Etc. However  The Spa Rang Me In Order To Book My Treatments For My Trip Which Was Very Efficient And They Were Very Friendly To Talk To.,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Agree,,,The Brasserie,The Cocktail Lounge,,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,In The Cocktail Bar  More Enjoyable Experience Due To Staff Friendliness  Smiley And Bubbly. In The Brasserie  Experience Was Enjoyable Once Restaurant Manager Was Able To Speak To Us And Offer A Good Service.,,,,,,,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,N/A,Agree,The Reception Of The Spa Was Friendly And Helpful  The Lockers And Changing Area Was Well Kept  And Finally The Treatments Were Enjoyable Because Of The Bubbly Members Of Staff Who Were Able To Talk To You And Converse With You  In Order To Let You Relax And Feel At Ease.,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Yes,Only With Hotel Staff  Spa Staff Were Very Attentive.  On Arrival My Friend And I Experienced Service Issues By Reception  Whose Staff Were Not Attentive And Did Not Have A Friendly Way Of Speaking To Guests.  We Arrived And Were Checking In When They Asked For Me To Present The Card I Had Made The Booking With  However I Was Not The Card Holder And Did Not Have The Card On Me  As It Was My Dad's. I Was Told By The Receptionist To Speak To The Other Receptionist (Phyll) As She Was New Which I Fully Understood. As I Began Speaking To The Other Receptionist About The Problem  Her Tone Was Extremely Patronizing  Not Noticed Only By Myself But Also By My Friend  Her Way Of Speaking To Me Was Very Condescending And I Felt Very Unwelcome And Felt Like I Was Being Treated Like A Child When I Am A Young Adult. I Was Then Told That We Could Not Check In Unless We Had A Card  Were As I Responded This Was Not Told To Me In Any Way Otherwise I Would Have Happily Obliged  As I Could Have Brought My Dad With Me To Help Us Check In  However  I Explained Very Calmly That This Was Not Reiterated To Me (In Email Or Over The Phone) And Therefore I Was Not Aware Of It  And It Was Responded With 'Its Just Common Sense' Which I Was Taken Aback By  As I Feel This Was Not Necessary To Say As I Had Already Explained That If I Knew This Was The Case  I Would Have Brought The Card Holder In Order To Verify The Card. As This Proceeded  I Was Concerned With Time As I Had Booked Spa Treatments For My Friend And I  As It Was Her 18Th Birthday At 4Pm  And It Was Now 3.30Pm  However The Receptionist Was Reluctant To Allow Us To Check In Without A Card And Suggested Taking My Friends Card In Order To Debt The Total Amount From. However  I Was Not Wanting To Do This As It Was For My Friends Birthday And I Was Paying For It. I Spoke To The Other Receptionist And Said That  Wouldn't The Full Amount Only Be Taken At The End Of The Stay And She Was Agreeing With Me That  That Should Be The Case  However The Other Receptionist Was Beginning To Be Rude And Simply Saying We Cannot Check You In Unless We Have The Card And Debt The Whole Amount Now. I Asked Several Times Why Would The Card Have To Be Debited The Full Amount Now  But An Answer Was Not Clearly Given Until I Had Asked Several Times  Because It Was A Debit Card  The Amount Had To Be Taken Immediately. I Simply Said Ok  But My Mum Was Currently On The Phone To The Manager  Who Came Out To Speak To Me  She Was Much More Attentive About The Situation And Simply Said That Because Of The Policy They Needed A Card To Be Able To Check Guests In  And I Said I Fully Understand But It Was Not Reiterated To Me Otherwise I Would Have Happily Brought The Card Holder Along. She Then Said That She Would Be Able To Debit My Friends Card Only Â£50 Instead  Therefore Allowing Us To Check In  As The Card Holder (My Dad) Had Agreed To Come Down To The Spa To Verify The Card Within A Few Hours. This Experience Was Not Pleasant  And Was Embarrassing For My Friend And I. As It Was Her Birthday I Wanted To Give Her A Stress Free Trip To The Spa And Experience The Treatments  However  I Feel The Moment We Stepped Into The Hotel  We Did Not Receive A Warm Welcome At All.   The Spa Staff Were Much More Friendly And I Would Definitely Return To The Spa But Unfortunately I Would Not Like The Experience Of Staying At The Hotel Again.,I Felt That Some Members Of Staff Need To Be Acknowledged And Thanked For Their Hospitality During Our Stay.  We Arrived On The 27Th Of May Around 3Pm And Was Greeted With A Smile By The Man On The Door  However I Did Not Catch His Name.  The Manager On That Day  However  I Unsure How To Spell Her Name Prima/Prema  Was The Only Person At The Hotel Reception Who Was Able To Solve Our Problem And Allow Us To Check In With The Least Amount Of Hassle. However  The Other Receptionist Phyll  Was Very Patronizing And Condescending When Speaking To Me.  The Spa Staff Were Lovely  On Reception They Greeted You With A Smile And Were Happy To Answer Any Questions.  I Had Booked Spa Treatments And The Two Women Who Were Providing The Treatments Were Very Smiley And Bubbly And Made You Feel At Ease  I Am Unsure Of The Name Of The Woman Providing My Friend Jess With Her Treatment. My Person's Name Was Jodie And She Was A Lovely Person And Was Able To Create An Enjoyable And Relaxing Experience.  In The Brassiere  The Manager Was The Most Attentive Staff Member  Being Able To Answer My Questions Efficiently And Offer Any Help During The Meal.  In The Cocktail Bar  Around 10Pm  The Man Behind The Bar Was Very Smiley And Attentive And Helped Us With Answering Questions And Was A Friendly Staff Member.    ,Strongly Agree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Fell Below,The Experience With The Hotel Fell Below My Expectations Due To The Complex Check In  Which Put A Dampener Over The Ability To Enjoy The Facilities. However  The Spa Definitely Met My Expectations And The Treatments And Staff In The Spa Exceeded My Expectations.,,Female,18-24,,,Sophie,sophie_lenovo@outlook.com,27Th May 2013,28Th May 2013,,,,,,,,,,,Please Select The Box

We Sat At Our Table For 10 Minutes Without Having It Made Up Despite Asking Several Staff Walking Past. They Then Proceeded To Make Up All Of The Other Vacant Tables Around Us But Not Ours. Eventually When It Was Set  We Were Left Missing Several Items Of Cutlery And No Milk Which We Had To Go And Get Ourselves In The End. Went To Make Tea And The Pot Had Run Out Of Hot Water  When I Asked A Member Of Staff If They Could Top It Up They Looked At Me Blankly.

The Food Was Ok But Not Something I Would Particularly Recommend To Other People.  We Ordered A Bottle Of House White With Our Meal.  At The End Of The Meal  We Waited For A Long Time To Ask If We Needed To Sign Anything (We Were Staying On The Spa Package And So Meals Were Included) And So Left Without Getting Anyone's Attention.  Staff Had Taken Our Room Numbers When We Arrived And So We Thought That Would Be Sufficient.  At 11Pm That Night  One Of Our Rooms Got A Call From Reception From A Member Of Staff Seemingly Accusing Us Of Deliberately Leaving Without Paying For The Wine.  We Explained That We Hadn't Paid For Anything During Our Stay Yet (We Assumed We Would Settle It All At Check Out As Per Our Conversation Upon Booking)  That The Staff In The Brasserie Took Our Room Numbers So Assumed The Wine Would Be Added To Our Room Bill.  The Member Of Staff Didn't Seem Happy With The Explanation And Was Quite Rude In Her Accusation.  The Room They Called Late At Night To Raise This Issue Had Two Heavily Pregnant Women Asleep In It - Given We Were Staying At The Hotel (And So Had Not Left The Premises)  Had Given Our Room Numbers To The Brasserie And Had Left Credit Card Details With Reception On Check In  I Think The Late Night Phone Call About An 'Unpaid' Bottle Of Wine Was Very Unprofessional And Unacceptable.

Unfortunately The Mattress On The Bed Was Very Uncomfortable- I Could Feel The Springs On The Mattress Which Means It Was Not Pleasant To Sleep On. The Pillows Were Uncomfortable So I Had To Use One Of The Small Cushions. However  The Major Problem With The Room Was It's Location  Directly Next To The Air Conditioning Unit. This Made My Stay Unbearable  I Was Awake Until 2Am Due To The Noise And Then Was Woken Continuously Through The Night. Since I Had Booked The Stay For A Relaxing Break  This Was Very Disappointing As I Woke Up Exhausted And Just Wanted To Go Home To Get A Proper Sleep.,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Disagree,Agree,I Had The Buffet Which I Thought Was Plentiful And Of Good Quality. However  Toast Was Not Offered Which Was Surprising. Once I Had Got My Food I Requested Some Toast With Brown Bread. Ten Minutes Later My Food Was Going Cold And Toast Not Appeared. I Requested It Again And It Came Five Minutes Later  But With No Butter. Requested Butter. Five Minutes Later It Turned Up  Hard As Rock! Toast Was Now Cold (Like The Butter)  Had To Request New Toast  New Butter And Get More Breakfast Items As The Ones I'd Got Were Now Stone Cold. Toast (With Spreadable Butter) Turned Up Five Minutes Later....On White Bread. I Gave Up At This Point. It Was A Little Bewildering As There Were Plenty Of Staff And It Was Very Quiet In The Brasserie  So Service Really Should Have Been Better. Staff Were Very Friendly And Polite Though.,,The Brasserie,,,Good,Good,Good,Fair,Excellent,Good,Service At Dinner Was Very Good. At Lunch However I Was Not Offered Water  Bread Or Butter  Despite This Being Clearly Available To Other Tables.

However One Of My Treatments Finished Slightly Early And As They Are Not Cheap It Is Important That Guests Are Offered The Full Amount Of Time. The Pool Was Lovely And Relaxing On My First Day But On The Morning Of Check-Out I Thought I Would Have A Final Swim And Was Dismayed To Find An Aqua Aerobics Class Taking Place In The Pool. Not Only Were All The Swimmers Forced To Squeeze Into A Tiny Section Of The Pool  But Everywhere Else You Went (Sauna  Steam Room Etc) You Couldn't Escape The Loud Pop Music- Not Very Relaxing! I Think If These Classes Are To Be Offered They Should Be After Check-Out Time As People On A 1-Night Stay Miss Out On Having A Relaxing Swim On The Day Of Their Departure.,Strongly Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Yes,All Mentioned On Previous Pages. All Staff Were Lovely And Polite  But Staff In Brasserie Not As Efficient As They Could Be. This Is A Real Shame As It Left Me Feeling A Bit Frustrated With My Overall Stay.    Due To The Unbearable Noise Where My Room Was Located  I Asked To Switch Rooms At Around Midnight And The Staff Were Very Accommodating And Helpful- Unfortunately The Room I Was Moved To Was Equally As Noisy So I Had To Move Back  But This Was Not Their Fault.,,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Fell Below,It Is Unfair To Market Your Hotel As A Relaxing Break  And Then Give People Rooms Where  Unless They Are Heavy Sleepers  They Will Be Unable To Get A Good Night's Sleep. I Wish I Had Read The Reviews On The Internet Which Make Similar Comments  So I Would Have Known To Specifically Request A Room Away From The Air-Conditioning Unit.  Also  As Check-Out Is At 11Am  I Would Advise Having More Than One Member Of Staff On Reception At This Time As There Was A Queue To Check Out.,,Female,25-34,,,Kate Tangri,kate_tangri@hotmail.com,19.06.13,20.06.13,,,,,,,,,,,

It Did However Seem Like More Of An Inconvenience That We Were There And He Couldn't Close Up Quick Enough After Our Order Was Complete.,Tanzin (Terrace Bar) - Both This And Last Year  He Was Extremely Attentive  Pleasant And Friendly To Us  Always Ensuring We Had Everything We Wanted And That All Problems Were Easily And Efficiently Resolved.,Agree,Agree,Agree,Met,Nothing Apart From The Content Of Previous Comments.,Many Thanks For Another Wonderful Year At Sopwell House  We Look Forward To Seeing You Soon.,Male,25-34,,,Jeremy & Sarah Horne,jez_horne@zyen.com,03/08/2013,05/08/2013,,general,spa & country club,,leisure breaks,,dining,,christmas,,

When I Checked In And Asked About Breakfast And Meals And What We Will Be Having.  The Lady Phones Through To The Kitchen  They Made No Effort And Said We Can Fruit And Croissants.  Unless The Croissant Were Diary Free We Could Not Have Them.  I Expected Extra Effort  And We Would Have Less Options Than Meat Eaters Without Any Help From The Kitchen Staff. When We Called Front Desk  The Phone Either Was Not Answered Or It Took Along Time To Be Answered.,Disagree,Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Room 107 - The Pillows Were Too Soft  Would Be Good To Have A Pillow Menu.  When We Arrived The Room Was Cleaned To A High Standard.  But On Sunday Am  There Were Two Trays In The Room  But Only One Tray Was Removed.  We Was Left With A Dirty Tray In The Room.  The Room Had Butter Biscuits And Diary Milk Which Could Not Be Eaten Or Drunk By Vegan.  If The Room Was Allocated On Booked And I Stated We Were Vegans  This Should Have Been Removed. We Forgot To Put The 'Do Not Disturb' Sign Out  But In The Morning The Cleaner Did Not Knock And Say Room Service.  This Normally Happens In Other Hotels I Have Stayed At  Announce They Are Entering A Room,Yes,No,No,Yes,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Room Service Took Too Long To Answer The Phone  The Service Was Poor.  In The Morning I Had To Go Down To The Restaurant As No One Answered The Phone.  In The Evening  The Phone Also Took Ages To Answer  On Some Occasions We Called Housekeeping And Asked To Be Transferred Or For Room Service To Call Us Back.   There Was No Selection For Us  The Staff Made Us Feel Like We Were Being Difficult.  We Had Reservations For The Brasserie But Decided To Have Room Service.   We Had A Choice Of Roasted Vegetable Panini And Fries Or Pasta With Vegetables.  This Was Disappointing And The Prices Were Totally Made Up And More Than Some Of The Meals On The Menu.  They Asked Us What We Wanted  But I Don't Understand Why They Did That As All Our Suggestions They Could Cater To. One Evening We Asked For Orange Juice  This Was Not Sent Up.  When We Asked The Delivery Staff Where It Was.  We Was Told They Would Sort This Out.  But The Orange Juice Was Not Sent Up.  We Did Not Bother To Phone Back As The Phone Was Never Answered.  We Asked For Soya Milk For Tea  The Milk Was Not Soya As The Next Day Milk Had Curdled  Thickened Separated.  This Does Not Happen With Soya Milk.  For Breakfast On Monday Morning  The Jam Was Not Brought To Our Room.  We Had To Phone To Get This Sent Up And We Got Warm Milk  Even Though We Asked For Cold Soya Milk. Honestly The Whole Experience With Room Service Was Poor And The Selection Was The Worst I Have Had In A Hotel Of This Status.  We Spent A Total Of Â£76.51 Including Room Service On Food At Sopwell.  Totally Over Priced For What We Had.  Thankfully We Were Able To Go To Woody's Vegetarian Cafe For Lunch On Both Days.  The Service Charge On Saturday Night Was Â£7.25 Night Porter And Â£3.51 Service Charge.  For The Service We Received  This Was Over Priced. I Would Not Want To Stay Again And Have To Go Through This And Struggle With Food  And Drive 20 Minutes To Have Eat A Decent Meal.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Agree,The Spa Was Fully Booked So Did Not Have Any Treatments.

But After Having Time To Think About It  I Don't Think I Will Come Back And Stay.  This Is Our 4Th Time Staying At Sopwell Over The Years And The Worst Yet.  Even With 50% Off The Accommodation  I Really Don't Think Its Worth It Especially Having Spent Â£400 For This Stay. I Would Appreciate It  If You Could Contact Me Directly To Discuss As I Was Going To Write You A Letter And Put My Feedback On Trip Advisor.  I Did Ask To Speak To You  But You Were Not Available.

After Asking If We Were Able To Order Food To The Hotel She Had Told Us It's Not Advisable As There Is A Restaurant  The Restaurant Does Not Cater For Vegans So We Had To Order Out.  Overall I Will Never Stay At Sopwell House Again  We Booked One Of The Most Expensive Rooms  And To Be Treated In That Manner  The Service Was Appalling. Very Disappointed As Our Room Was Lovely. ,,Agree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Fell Below,,,Female,25-34,,,Seema Patel,seema01patel@gmail.com,05/10/2013,06/10/2013,,,,,,,,,,,Please Select The Box

Perhaps You Should Not Charge Â£149 For A Room That Is Not To The Same Standard Of The Other Rooms. It's A Shame We Were Not Put In One Of These As Perhaps Our Stay Would Have Been More Enjoyable.

They Were Twin Guys  Very Charming And Helpful Throughout Our Stay. Key Cards Didn't Work Twice  And We Had To Go Back To Reception But That Was Resolved Albeit Annoying To Come Back Down. You Should Check The Magnetic Strip On The Door Itself For Future Reference. The Spa Was First Class  Loved The Espa Range And The Therapist Holly Was One Of The Best I've Ever Had. Spa Facilities Were Great On 2Nd Day  First Day Was Bombarded By This Massive Group. Afternoon Tea Was Fabulous And So Tasty And Relaxing In The Lush Environment. Waiter Was So Accommodating As I Couldn't Eat The Fish Options Of Sandwiches And Provided Me Alternatives. We Dined In The Brasserie For My Partners Birthday Meal The First Night And The Set Menu Met Expectations And More. We Had Breakfast And Lunch The Following Day And Both Had Such A Wide Selection Of Good And Healthy Food. The Room Was Good With A Great View. My Partner Loved That You Had Sky Sports Available  We Have Stayed In Hotels Around The World  Even The Shangri-La Chain And They Didn't Have This  So He Was Impressed.

The Spa Staff Were Excellent  However The Service We Received Everywhere Else In The Hotel Was Appalling Considering The Premium We Paid To Stay With You. We Waited For 45 Minutes On The Terrace Area Before A Waiter Even Took Our Order.  It Then Took 20 Minutes To Serve Us 2 Drinks. Later That Evening Our Friends Came To Pick Us Up To Go To A Function And We Decided To Have Some Drinks On The Terrace Before We Left.  Again It Took Around 20 Minutes For Someone To Take Our Order.  The Waiter Who Took Our Order Clearly Could Not Understand Us And 3 Of The 4 Drinks Ordered Were Wrong.  We Were Then Presented With Another Table's Bill For Â£107. On Both Occasions The Terrace Was Barely Half Full.  There Were Simply Not Enough Staff There And Those That Were There Appeared Incompetent. The Next Morning Was No Better  The Breakfast Buffet Was Empty And Not Being Refilled  There Again Seemed To Be Very Few Staff On Duty And We Waited An Eternity To Eat. Our Final Ordeal Was Checking Out.  Stood In A Queue At Reception For 30 Minutes.  I Explained My Dissatisfaction To The Girl On The Desk.  She Referred Me To A Lady Who Was Introduced As The Duty Manager.  She Felt The Best Way To Deal With My Complaint Was To Make A Joke About It And Tell My Wife To Cheer Up!  She Was Trying To Be Friendly  However Massively Misjudged The Situation And Compounded The Incredibly Poor Service We Had Already Received. She Went Off To Find The Manager  But He Was Off Duty.  She Promised That The Manger Would Call Me Later That Day And I Gave Her My Mobile Number.  It Is Now 3 Days Later And Unsurprisingly I Have Not Received A Call. It Is A Rare Treat For Myself And My Wife To Have A Child Free Night Away And We Had Travelled 180 Miles From Our Home In North Wales.  Including Spa Treatments And My Wife's Visit To The Hair Salon  We Spent Â£400 On Our One Nights Stay With You And Our Lasting Impression Of Sopwell House Is The Appalling Level Of Service We Received.  ,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Very Nice Room  But Very Small For An 'Executive Double',No,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,,,,,The Conservatory,Very Poor,Fair,Fair,Very Poor,Very Poor,Very Poor,,,,,,,,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,N/A,N/A,,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Yes,See Previous Comments.,Holly From The Spa Was Excellent  Very Friendly And Professional,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Fell Below,,,Male,35-44,,,Jonathan Seddon,jonathan.seddon@sjpp.co.uk,06/07/2013,07/07/2013,,,,,,,,,,,

Hello  I Thought I Would Drop You A Line Regarding To My Recent Stay At Sopwell House On One Of Your Two Day Breaks.  All In All  My Sister And I Had A Lovely Time.  The Service In The Restaurant  Overseen By Tony Most Of The Time  Was Superb And The Food Was Great At Breakfast  Lunch And Dinner.  We Have Used The Hotel In The Past And Really Noticed A Significant Improvement In Facilities All Around The Hotel And Especially The Country Club And Spa And Our Afternoon By The Pool  Massages (Holly In My Case) And Even A Haircut On Site Were All Great.  My Only However Though Was About The Room Allocation.  On Arriving We Were Shown A Room That  In My View  And Having Stayed Previously For A Hen Night And Wedding As Well As Previously ÂGirlyâ Spa Weekends  Was Most Definitely Not A ÂSuperior Twinâ As Per The Booking Made.  In Fact  It Was Still A Double And Would Required ÂTwinning.  I Questioned This At Reception And Was Told Nothing Else Was Available By The First Receptionist  Then Other Rooms Did Become Available  Once A Second Receptionist Got Involved  But I Was Informed There Would Be An Extra Charge Of Â£20 Per Night.   I Agreed To This And We Were Shown Two Other Rooms  Which I Suspect Were Targeted At Disabled Guests Â Wide Doors  Low Sink  No Bath ... However  Both A Better Standard Than The First Offering  So One Of These Suited Us Once The Double Bed Had Been Made A Twin.  Having Looked At Your Website And Deliberating Choosing A Larger  Superior Room Â Described As Sleeping Up To 3 Adults  I Was Perplexed At Where You Would Have Put A Third Adult Without Removing The Armchairs?  None Of The Rooms We Saw Had A Black Marble Bathroom Or Room For A Third Bed As Is Stated May Be Available In Some Of The Superior Rooms.   On Checkout  As Had Been Explained  We Had Been Charged Extra For The Room Which I Was Happy To Pay.  However To Add To My Room Frustration  Unfortunately  I Was Next To A Couple Checking Out As The Receptionist Congratulated Them On Achieving A Complimentary Upgrade To Their Room.  I Understand They Are Likely To Be Have Been Booked In Under A Different Deal  But Did End Up Feeling A Bit Like A Second Class Citizen.  Having Worked In Hospitality Previously  I Know How Discretionary Such Things Like Room Allocation Can Be.  It Was A Shame That The Reception / Room Allocation Experience Was So Far Removed From All The Other Experiences Of Our Stay.  You May Want To Share This With One Of Your Managers To Ensure Future Guests DonâT End Up Being Similarly Frustrated.  I Think It Is Difficult To Spot Which Of Your Guests Is Likely To Be An Experienced Hotel User  So Taking An Approach Where All Get The Best Service Possible Is Always Going To Reap Rewards In My View.  As Stated  The Overall Experience Was A Good One  Being In A Customer Facing Role Myself  I Always Welcome Feedback Whether Positive Or Negative As A Means Of Improving Our Service.  I Hope You Find This Helpful And Feel Free To Pass Onto Those Individuals We Have Named!  As Previously Mentioned  The Service Overall Was Really Top Notch!

At Breakfast On The First Morning We Were Asked If We Would Like Brown Or White Toast Or A Combination Of Both.  We Asked For White Toast Only  But Were Given A Combination Of Both.  On The Second Morning Our Table Had Not Be Laid Up Properly After The Previously Guests Had Vacated It And There Were No Cups On The Table For Tea/Coffee And No Member Of The Waiting Staff Came To Ask Us If We Would Like A Drink.  In The End We Had To Ask For A Cup Of Tea.  The Managers In The Restaurant Seemed To Be Very Good  But The Actually Waiting Staff Did Not Listen And Did Not Deliver What Was Requested Of Them.  The Breakfast Food Was Brilliant  Both Is Choice  Quality And Taste  But The Service Somewhat Let It Down.,,The Brasserie,,,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Fair,Good,Good,Our Table For Our Evening Meal Was Not Laid Up Properly After The Previous Guests Had Vacated It And Throughout The Meal The Staff Had To Keep Going To Get Cutlery Or Glasses For Us.

Also  When We Went To The Bar For A Drink  The Waitress Got The Wrong Drink On The First Night And Left Us Waiting For A Long Time On The Second Night.  Overall  Apart From The Managers  We Would Consider Most Of The Waiting Staff To Be Poor.  The One Exception Was In The Terrace Bar Where We Had Something To Eat And A Pot Of Tea On The Sunday Afternoon.  We Were Served By A Young Man With Ginger Hair And Glasses And He Was The Only Member Of Staff Who Actually Engaged With Us And Had A Conversation With Us And He Got Our Order Right First Time.,Young Man In The Terrace Bar - Ginger Hair And Glasses.  He Was In The Terrace Bar On Sunday Afternoon (23/6/13) And Served Us With A Pot Of Tea For Two  A Panini And A Smoked Salmon Bagel.  Despite Him Being Very Busy Trying To Set Up For A Big Party Coming In For Afternoon Tea  He Still Took The Time To Chat To Us  He Got Our Order Correct And Was Friendly.  He Was The Only Member Of Staff Who Actually Did This.,Agree,,Disagree,Fell Below,Staff Should Be Better Trained And Encouraged To Interact More With Guests.  More Importantly They Should Listen And Get Orders Correct - If They Don't Hear What We Have Said Then We Don't Mind Them Asking Again  Especially As It Is Quite Noisy In The Brasserie.  Customer Service And Making Guests Feel Welcome Is Very Important  Both To Us As Guests And To You To Encourage Future Business.,Overall Our Stay Was Comfortable.  We Really Enjoyed The Food And The Room Was Nice.  However  The Room Was A Little Warm And The Bed Creaky  But We Slept Ok.  The Gardens At Your Hotel Are Lovely And Credit Should Be Given To Your Gardeners For Keeping Them Looking So Lovely.  Mostly It Was The Service From A Lot Of Your Waiting Staff That Let Your Hotel Down.  We Were Attending A Friend's Celebration In The Area  Hence Our Stay At Your Hotel  But I Am Not Sure That We Would Return To Your Hotel If We Were In The Area Again.  Also  Despite The Fact That I Booked Our Stay In My Name  Mrs Leonard  And I Was Addressed As Mrs Leonard By The Receptionist Upon Check-Up  The Email Inviting Me To Take Part In This Survey Was Simply Address 'Dear Leonard'  Which I Found Rather Rude.

Lastly  The Check Out On Sunday Morning.  This Was Very Poor  We Waited About 25 Mins To Check Out And The Queue Was Horrendous.  My Husband Noted That Quite A Few People Were Complaining About The Overall Service In The Hotel.  This Needs Rectifying Quickly As It Is Just Not Acceptable For This Kind Of Hotel To Have These Kind Of Problems.  My Husband Stays In Many Hotels And He Was Amazed That A Hotel Of This Standard Should Have These Problems With Service.,On Saturday Evening Before We Went Out We Decided To Drink In The Cocktail Bar.

Paul The Manager Had Indicated That We Were To Have Free Champagne And Were To Be Looked After At Dinner. Well We Had Already Ordered And Paid For A Bottle Of Champagne At The Table And That Was The Only One We Had. When We Asked The Waitress About It She Said She Was Told To Give Us The House Wine. So Although We Had Paid For 2 Treatments Each Only 4 Of Us Had Them  The Other 4 Had One Treatment That Lasted Half An Hour.,It's A Shame That These 4 Ladies Missed Out On A Treatment Due To No Fault Of Our Own And I Realise That The Spa Is Busy And Always Booked.

Tried To Set Temp Waited Half An Hour Then Found Chambermaid To Try  She Couldn't Do So Called Reception. Maintenance Arrived And Set  As Heating Came On Smell Of Smoke Worse  Also Carpet Damp To Walk On As Room Had Been Smoked In And Carpet Cleaned.  At First Reception Said No Other Room Then We Were Moved To Room 222.  This Was Ok But Only Double Bed  We Always Have Kingsize As Mr Whyman Large Build  Mattress Soft And Over Noisy Banqueting But That Was Not So Much A Problem.  We Dined In The Main Restaurant Which Was Fine  Although Water Never Did Arrive When Requested.  On Departure Mr Whyman Asked For Reduction For Inconvenience As This Was Meant To Be A Relaxing Weekend For Him Due To His Busy Work Schedule  Like Many Others  But Vince Said He Could Do Nothing But Offered An Upgrade Next Time We Stay! Our Afternoon Completely Wasted So He Left Not A Happy Man.  I Have Been A Member For 12 Years  Stayed Many Times Which Have Been Lovely With No Complaints  The Last Being 4 July 13.  I Really Think He Could Have Made A Reduction  Or Offered Lunch In Brasserie Or Something  An Upgrade Just Means You Have To Spend More Money.  We Have Stayed Twice At Luton Hoo And Been Upgraded To Suites At Â£799 For Nothing  So That's Is Where My Partner Will Chose Next Time.  This Was My Idea As A Member I Am Happy There  But When Membership Went Up It Was My Partner Who Persuaded Me To Stay  So I Felt Quite Bad Vince Didn't Give Any Compensation  Apart From Bottle Of Wine In Room.  All He Could Say Was How Great The Place Is Now With The Refurbishments  But I Know As A Member Had To Put Up With Them All.    Not A Relaxing Weekend As Planned  Which Is A Shame As We Were Going To Use It More Often As My Partner Not Local  Also Spa Busy No Treatments Available Which Is Understandable  Breakfast And Service Really Good Though.

When Phoned To Confirm This Was Told Correct Even Though Cheaper To Pay Full Price To Use Leisure Facilities. Checked Again With Evening Staff After Wedding Who Informed Me Any Guest At Any Price Were Able To Use Leisure Facilities. When Checked Again On Paying Sunday Morning Was Told Could Not Use Leisure Facilities As Paying Discounted Price. Expressed My Anger At Being Advised Differently Repeatedly So Two Of My Guests Did Use Them On Sunday Morning At No Extra Charge. My Complaint Is That The Extra Charge Seems Too High And Even Petty. Have Never Been To A Hotel That Does Not Allow Guests To Use Leisure Facilities Whatever Rate They Pay For The Room. But Also That I Was Advised Differently On Four Different Occasions By 4 Different Members Of Staff  So There Would Appear To Be A Staff Training Issue There.,Porters Were Very Polite And Helpful,Disagree,Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Met,Asked For Early Check In Of 1.30Pm As Hotel On Way To Church Then Reception At Hotel After.

On The Saturday Evening I Informed The Restaurant That We Would Be Bringing Guests With Us On The Monday Only To Be Told That Such Facility Was Not Available On Monday Evenings.

Service Was A Bit Slow And We Left Before We Got Our Dessert (Although We Had Ordered It) And It Was Brought To Us In Our Room. They Said It Would Not Be Charged For But I Think It Was. The Restaurant Manager Apologised At The Time And They Did Have A Large Birthday Party Going On. It Was All Just A Bit Unfortunate Although The Fault Was Probably Ours For Choosing The Wrong Place To Eat  But I Thought There Was No Alternative.

The Facial Which I Went Into With Eye Make Up On Still Had The Bottom Line On When I Went Back To My Room.  As For The Pedicure  I Felt It Fell Well Below ' Deluxe' As I Was Told I Was Having.  When It Came To Checkout There Was An Extra Â£47 On My Bill. I Queried This And Was Told I Had Booked A 'Deluxe Pedicure' I Said I Had Not I Had Called And Asked If I Could Change A Back Massage For A Pedicure And Was Told It Would Be An Extra Â£15.  Whilst Waiting For The Manager  I Was Sitting In Reception And Noticed That My Pedicure Was 'Two Tone' As The Second Coat Of Nail Varnish Did Not Cover The First  This Could Be Because The Spa Room Was So Dim That The Therapist Could Not See Properly.  I Explained All This To The Manager  Who Said That I Had Booked A 1Hour Facial And A Deluxe Pedicure And That The Package Was 2- 25Minute Treatments And It Was In My Letter . I Explained That I Had Not Booked This  It Was A Gift  And Not In My Letter Which I Showed Him  And That When I Phoned To Book These Treatments  All I Was Told Was That It Would Cost An Extra Â£25. He Then Deducted The Extra Cost From The Bill.  My Husband Has Suffered A Stroke And The Past Few Months Have Been Very Stressful. I Therefore Did Not Need This Aggravation Added.   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firstly  The Receptionist Asked Us What We Wanted To Do With Our Room And Was Fairly Surprised When We Wanted To Check In. We Then Had To Repeat Our Personal Details A Number Of Times As She Incorrectly Entered Them Into The System. She Then Presented Us With Paperwork With Someone Else's Address On And Appeared Exasperated When We Said It Was The Wrong Address And The Process Began Again. She Then Asked For Payment And Was Very Very Unclear Asking For Â£50 And We Kept Asking What This Was For - It Wasn't A Problem For Us To Pay We Just Were Not Clear What It Was For. The Whole Check In Process Was Confusing And Lacked Clarity.  She Clearly Did Not Listen To Us And Even When We Said We Had Stayed Before - Told Us Directions To The Pool As So On  Again Not A Problem If She Hadn't Just Asked Us If We Had Stayed Before And Then Ignored The Answer.  It Demonstrated A Lack Of Customer Care And We Felt A Bit Like Generic Cattle Rather Than A Couple Embarking On A Romantic Retreat!  It Really Took The Gloss Of Our Arrival.  ,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,It Matched Our Experience Of Poor Customer Care  For Example No Toast And Having To Ask A Number Of Times For Items.

On Both Days We Waited Over 20 Minutes For Anyone To Even Acknowledge Us And Take Our Order And This Was After Several Prompts From Us. It Was Really Disappointing And Embarrassing.  Then The Food Took A Very Long Time To Arrive And On Both Days The Orders Were Wrong  Just Little Things Like Olives In A Salad When I'd Asked For The Salad Without Olives And Chips With The Burger Instead Of Separately Plated As I Am A Vegetarian And My Husband Is Not And We Were Hoping To Share!  Both Lunch Experiences Left Us Really Disappointed And Would Make Us Unlikely For Us To Return.  We Just Expect Firstly  A Better Standard Of Service And Secondly  Attention To Detail.  I Really Feel The Staff Let The Hotel Down . Please Note We Were Delighted With The Dinner Service That Was Quick  Discreet And First Class. We Were On A Romantic Retreat Break Away From Our 3 Children (Which Is Rare!) And Really Wanted To Feel A Bit Spoilt By The Sopwell Experience But The Inconsistent Service And Totally Poor Service Really Took The Shine Off And We Ended Up Spending Sunday Lunch Talking About How Terrible The Service Was Rather Than Enjoying Ourself. It Was A Real Shame.,,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Fell Below,,A Mixed Stay  Lovely Room And Evening Meal But Tg The Inconsistent Service In Every Other Area Was Incredibly Disappointing.  We Have Stayed A Couple Of Times Before And Loved Our Stay  Hence Coming Back. This Time However  We Would Look For Other Alternatives. It Was Little Things But When They Add Up And Fall Well Below What You'd Expect From A Hotel Of Your Calibre   It Makes Us Not Want To Return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And In Fact  We Moved To The Side To Make Way For Her And Found Ourselves Apologising To Her.  She Looked As Though She Was Managerial And Had A Bunch Of Keys Jangling At Her Side.

I Enquired About & Booked Our Stay Over 6 Months Ago & A Week Before Coming I Called To Confirm Our Booking & I Am Glad I Did! There Were Only 2 Rooms Booked Instead Of 5 & I Hadn't Received Any Conformation Of My Booking. My Initial Call Wasn't Dealt With Straight Away  I Called Back Twice & Left Voice-Mail Messages To Which I Didn't Get A Return Call  I Had To Then Call Again As I Wanted To Resolve This Issue & Make Sure There Were Rooms For Everyone That Was Coming With Me For The Weekend. Luckily I Spoke To Jenny Bevans Who Sorted Everything Out For Me & Booked The Extra Rooms I Required. It Seemed The Information On The Computer System Compared To The Paperwork Was Totally Different  Which I Was Very Surprised About. On Arrival Afew Of Us Checked In At Different Times  6 Guests Were Told They Weren't Booked Into A Room & The Receptionist Didn't Seem To Know What She Was Doing & Wasn't Very Welcoming  She Spent Most Of The Time Asking For Money! I Confirmed Beforehand I Would Pay On Arrival/Departure. There Was Also An Issue With Lack Of Communication From The Reception Staff  As We Were Having To Ask Alot Of Questions Rather Than Being Told Where To Go & What To Do  Times For Dinner  Where The Spa Was  How To Get To The Rooms Etc. We Also Had An Issue When It Came To The Lockers In The Changing Room  They Were Very Temperamental As They Wouldn't Always Open/Close. When Putting The Code In For My Locker  Another Locker Opened Instead! I Eventually Got Mine Open  But I Didn't Feel These Were 100% Safe! On A More Positive Note  Our Experience At Sopwell House Was Very Enjoyable & Relaxing  The Rooms Were Very Nice  The Food Was Excellent & The Facilities Were Brilliant. The Surroundings & Location Were Amazing & The Treatments Were Enjoyed By All. On The Down Side  We Felt Very Disappointed With The Lack Of Communication & Poor Customer Service We Received On Arrival & Also The Problems With The Initial Booking I Made & The Lack Of Communication Between Staff.

We Went Straight To Our Room And Got Changed And Came Down To The Bar To Be Told It Was Shut. On Previous Visits The Bar Shut At 2Am So We Were A Bit Miffed But Nonetheless Went Back To The Room To Order Drinks And Room Service. Room Service Came Over An Hour After Ordering (A Few Sandwiches!) And To Say That Was Was Delivered Was Disgusting Us An Understatement. A Very Nice Gentleman That Even Dealt With Us And His Customer Service Was Second To None. He Explained That You Were Short Staffed And The Person Making The Food Would. Not Usually Be Making It. It Was Very Simple Things Like The Bread Was Hard  Probably Where It Had Been Sitting There For So Long And The 'Toasted' Salmon Bagel Was Not Toasted Etc Etc. I Was Fed Up And Ran Myself A Bath But The Hit Water Would Only Run Luke Warm! I Gave Up And Went To Bed.

It Was Disappointing To Note That The Booked Room Was Not Available At 3Pm  Despite The Website Confirming That Rooms Would Be Available From This Time. So In Summary The Check In Experience Was Unacceptably Poor. The Experience Continued Negatively At Dinner  When The Host Advised That Our Booking Again Did Not Include Dinner. When I Explained What Had Happened At Check In She Said She 'Would Need To Charge' And 'Would Tell Our Story' To Reception. Clearly This Language And Approach Is Totally Unacceptable And Left A Sour Taste In The Mouth During Dining  Spoiled The Stay In Fact.,Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,See Previous Comments On Unacceptable Arrival Process,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Disagree,Room 257. Insufficient Quantities Of Milk  Sugar And Teabags Etc  Only Enough For One Cup Which Really Isn't Enough. The Flex On The Kettle Is Too Short For The Available Plug Sockets  Meaning That To Boil The Kettle It Needed To Be Precariously Balanced At An Angle On The Desk - Certainly A Health And Safety Hazard.

In The Morning Every Bed Was Decked With A Towel Though The Very Great Majority Remained Unattended For At Least Two Hours. There Was Nowhere To Sit Or Relax Yet Very Few People About.

Secondly The Rooms Must Be Ready As Advertised At 3Pm: If They Cant Be Ready  Dont Advertise That They Can. Thirdly  Better Communication Between Check In And Brasserie Staff So That The Customer Is Not Inconvenienced. Fourthly  Better Management Of Bed Availability In The Pool.,I Would Like Someone To Contact Me By Email At Asmcgee@Mac.Com And Respond To My Experiences.

However  We Found The Spa Facilities Very Very Busy. Not At All Relaxing. There Were No Loungers Or Chairs Available For Us Poolside On The Day We Arrived  There Was Also A Shortage Of Robes Availablen. I Am Overweight And The Towels Did Not Cover Me. My Friend Is Heavily Pregnant And Not Having A Robe To Cover Her  She Felt Self Conscious And With No Where To Sit Poolside  We Only Spent An Hour There For Our Whole Stay. The Treatments We Received Were Fantastic And Helped Us To Relax. We Enjoyed The Food In The Evening And The Quality Of The Room Was Great. We Were Told That The Restaurant Would Be Open At 6.30Am And Arrived At 7.30Am To Have To Wait An Extra Half Hour To 8Am! We Ended Up Laying On A Bed Relaxing After Breakfast As We Could See How Busy The Pool Area Was. For This Reason We Checked Out By 11 And Decided Not To Stay For Lunch Or To Use Spa Facilities. We Couldn't Fault The Staff Or Facilities(Apart From The Make It Yourself Nescafe Coffee At Breakfast - But That Is Being Very Picky!)

Also The Reception Desk Staff Knew Nothing Either About The Christmas Package - It Was Incredible  ,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,This Was Mews 10. The Room Was So Shabby And In Need Of Refurbishment That It Would Be Difficult To Keep Clean. The Heating Was Completely Inadequate And Old And At One Point Broke Down Briefly. It Was Badly Secured To The Wall With Loose Screws Which Looked Dangerous. I Had To Ask For Two Radiators And Many Extra Blankets. There Were No Towel Rails Or Hooks In The Bathroom Which Also Had No Heated Towel Rail  Making It Very Cold. It Took Ages To Heat The Bathroom With The Inadequate Manual Heater. There Was A Problem With The Bath Taps Which Were Old And Broken So It Was Difficult To Turn On The Water. The Bed Was Not Finished And I Had To Finish Putting A Pillow In A Pillow Case. There Were No Brochures Laid Out - I Found The Main One For The Hotel In An Obscure Drawer Two Days Later - The Christmas Scroll Was Crucially Missing - And The Smaller Brochures Were Old And Dog-Eared And Not Laid Out. It Poured With Rain For Most Of The Stay And There Were Big Leaks Over The Door So Spouts Of Water Poured Down As You Stood By The Door Trying To Open It  So That You Got Soaked And This Could Have Made An Older Person Ill. Incredibly The Wi Fi Gradually Ran Out Like An Old-Fashioned Meter - This Was The Thing My Friends Found So Unbelievable. When I Raised Some Of These Points With Vince He Said (Clearly With The Greatest Sincerity  As If Scarily He Had Been Brain-Washed Into Nonsensical Beliefs) That I Should Have Called Hotel Maintenance To Have Hooks Put On The Doors - He Didn't Seem To Realise That It Is The Hotel's Responsibility To Provide An Adequately Equipped Room  Not A Guest's Responsibility,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Although Some Deliveries Were Ok In General This Was Also Appalling - Even When Vince Stepped In To Try And Improve It - What Was Worse Was That Even His Requests Were Flouted And Ignored. Meals Were Delivered Absolutely Stone Cold Or Badly And Resentfully  Or In Direct Contravention To Precise Instructions. It Was A Nightmare And Very Scary And Was The Key Reason I Never Risked Going Back To The Hotel. I Actually Felt Frightened About Being Alone As A Woman  As The Room Service Was Always Delivered By Men  Never Women  And It Was Not Always Clear That They Were Not Drunk.,,,,,,,The Brasserie,The Cocktail Lounge,The Conservatory,Very Poor,Very Poor,Very Poor,Very Poor,Very Poor,Very Poor,This Was An Absolute Nightmare - Once The Scroll Had Not Been Delivered And Incredibly I Had Not Been Told That A Dinner Dance On Christmas Eve Was Compulsory For A Single Guest (I Had Assumed The Dinner Would Take Place In A Different Room From The Dance Floor)  With No Option Of Not Attending It (Although If I Had Realised Beforehand  There Would Have Been A Chance Of Finding A Sensible Solution) And I Had Lost Any Opportunity Of Meeting Guests Before Christmas Day (As None Of The Guests In The Spa Were On The Christmas Package) Raising The Real Risk Of Not Being Able To Participate In The Christmas Package At All As A Single Person  Which Was What Eventually Happened. There Was Never At Any Point The Slightest Attempt To Make Sure I Received The Expensive Meals I Had Paid For. The Only Attempt Was On Christmas Eve Where I Had A Miserable Late Meal In The Brasserie  Served Cold And Unappetising  With Peter Unnecessarily Giving What He Later Described As 'Butler Service' Which I Did Not Want And Did Not Request  When There Was A Perfectly Good Maitre D' Standing Doing Nothing,,,,,,,Agree,Strongly Disagree,N/A,N/A,N/A,Agree,All The Spa Treatments Were Booked Up Prior To The Christmas Package - Another Sign Of The Complete Lack Of Any Help From The Reservations Department,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Yes,The Service Was Staggeringly - Unbelievably  Scarily - Incompetent. It Seemed That Not A Single Person In The Whole Hotel Had Read The Christmas Brochure. Most Incredibly  On Several Occasions (Including Even From Reservations) I Was Asked As A Guest By Staff For Basic Information About The Hotel As If I Would Be More Informed Than They  And As If This Was Normal. The Reception Desk Staff Knew Nothing About Midnight Mass At The Cathedral  And Nothing About The Carol Concert (Which I Assumed From The Description In The Christmas Brochure Would Be An Operatic Selection). The Time On The Brochure Was Completely Wrong For The Mass As By The Time I Arrived There (With A Guest Not On The Christmas Package) There Was Standing Room Only And There Was No Option Of Exploring The Cathedral Which Would Have Been Possible If We Had Been Advised To Arrive Much Earlier. We Were Also Cheated By The Taxi Driver. It Was As If The Hotel Had Never Had A Christmas Package Before And Had Never Had A Single Guest At Christmas Before. The Sensible Solution Would Have Been For Peter The Manager To Look At The Guest List And Introduce Me To Other Single Guests (Such As A Mother And Daughter Who Reservations Had Told Me About  Although They Sensibly Might Have Cancelled) - This Was Never Suggested Or Tried.,Once The Situation Was Completely Out Of Control And Beyond Recall On Boxing Day  When I Had Lost The Whole Of The Christmas Package And All The Hotel Did Was Argue That It Had Never Made Any Mistakes (Clearly Only Concerned About Not Losing Money) Vince Did His Utmost To Turn The Situation Around With Extraordinary Sincerity And Kindness - But Since His Values Were Completely At Variance With The Ruthless Values Of Peter And The Hotel - It Was Worrying Dealing With Vince As He Had Been So Naively Brainwashed By The Hotel  Like So Many Trusting Well-Intentioned People Who Are Unable To Comprehend The Ruthless Callousness Of Commercialism. He Presented A Nonsensical Position That The Hotel Was So Eager To Please Guests That I Could Have Requested Maintenance To Put A Hook On The Bathroom Door - I Was So Shocked By His Ingenuousness That I Didn't Bother To Contest This  As I Have Seen People Made Ill When They Discover Their Values Are So At Variance With The Grim Realities Of Real Life,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Fell Below,At Every Stage Sensible Steps Could Have Been Taken To Turn This Situation Around  As I Am A Realistic Tolerant Person. However As The Sole Preoccupation Was With Justifying The Hotel's Position So As Not To Lose Money  There Was Never Any Possibility Of This,The Check Out Was As Callous And Insensitive As The Rest Of The Stay - Gita  The Manager  Pretended Nothing Had Happened And Even Charged Me Even Though I Had Had No Value For The Stay - I Was So Exhausted And Upset And So Convinced By The Ruthlessness Of The Hotel That It Didn't Occur To Me That I Could Have Refused To Sign The Bill For The Relatively Low Amount Outstanding  Otherwise I Would Have Refused. Although I Had Told Her Twice What Time I Was Leaving Which Was Half An Hour After She Came To Do The Check-Out  She Appeared To Have Forgotten This  And Offered Me Help Then And There With A Hotel Member Of Staff She Had Brought With Her. By Then I Had Lost All Confidence In The Hotel's Ability To Organise Anything So I Was Given No Help Half An Hour Later When My Taxi Arrived,Female,,Ms,Camilla,Ballinger,cballinger7@gmail.com,23 December 2013,27 December 2013,,,,,,,,,,,

I Understand It's A Huge Hotel  And Takes Time To Prepare The Rooms But I Do Feel Enough Notification Was Given  It In Fact Proved Quite Stressful To Get In To Prep The Room Just Before The Guests Arrived. ,The Brasserie Was  Booked For Dinner Over The Telephone. I Called To Double Check The Booking A Few Days Before We Arrived. Yet On Arrival For Dinner We Were Told The Booking Was In The Restaurant. We Had Definitely Requested The Brasserie.

We Woke Up And Went For Breakfast And Went To Reception At 11Am To Check Out. We Then Headed To The Spa To Be Told We Were Not Allowed In As We Had A 2 Year Old And Swimming Had Finished!  At No Point Were We Told There Were Time Restrictions On The Swimming (At Check In  Or At Breakfast)  So We Had Not Showered Due To The Fact We Were Planning On Using The Spa Facilities.  I Asked At Reception And The Same Lady Was There Who Checked Us In Apologised As She Said She Should Have Told Us About The Restrictions.  The Front Of House Duty Manager Then Told Us We Could Go Into The Pool But We May Be Asked To Leave If Our Daughter Was To Loud And Disruptive As We Would Probably Get Complaints From The Other Guests!!  We Declined This  As We Were Not Prepared To Go In Only Be Told To Leave Again! Our Daughter Had Her Swimming Costume On So We Had To Deal With Her Being Extremely Upset As We Had Told Her We Were Going Swimming. We Then Went Into The Spa To Get Her Changed And Went Straight Home To Shower Which Is Not What You Expect When You Have Stayed In A Nice Hotel – You Want To Use The Facilities.  For A ‘Spa’ Hotel This Is Completely Unacceptable As We Had Planned To Use The Facilities And If We Had Been Told There Was A Time Restriction We Would Have Gone Swimming Straight After Breakfast!

The Biggest Disappointment For Us Was After The Treatments  Feeling Relaxed  Entering The Pool And Finding Several Children In There Making Noise. They Weren't Doing Anything Wrong  But This Totally Disturbed The Whole 'Spa' Experience  As The Pool Area Did Not Feel Relaxed. It Didn't Really Feel Like A Spa At All - More Like A Leisure Centre. I Recently Visited Wybosten Lakes Spa With Friends And Have To Say That I Would Favour The Spa There Over Sopwell House  As The Wybosten Lakes Spa Had A Wonderful Quiet  Relaxed Atmosphere Which Unfortunately Sopwell House Did Not.

However  When Your Hotel Is Packed Full Of Spa Weekend Guests The Atmosphere Is Not What I Would Expect At All From A Calibre Of Hotel Such As Sopwell Park.

The Number Of Guests Shuffling Around In White Bathrobes And Slippers  Especially In The Brasserie On Sunday Morning Gave The Hotel An Air Of "One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest'.  

Saturday Night In The Same Brasserie Was Interesting.  We Couldnt Help But Notice That The Customer Base Was Massively Dominated By Women  And The Noise Level That Accompanied That Was Substantial.  But Then I Understand That There Were Two 'Hen Parties' In The Brasserie That Night  Including One That Had The Prospective Bride Dressed Up In The Customary Barbie Pink Sash And Tiara.  While The Silver Mini Skirts And Skin Tight Dresses Favoured By Her Guests Made Us Question Whether We Had Taken A Wrong Turn And Were In A Romford Nightclub.

We Didnt Eat In The Restaurant Because We Felt That We Were Underdressed As We Were Wearing Jeans - Smart Jeans - But Jeans None The Less.  I Obviously Made A Misjudgement There.  

The Staff Were Great.  I Would Say That Your Staff Are What I Would Expect From A 5 Star Hotel.  Its Your Guests That Are The Problem And My Background In Luxury Hotel Sales Tells Me That Its Your Spa Weekend Breaks That Are Attracting Them.  

All In All I Spent Just Over £500 On A One Night Stay On Saturday Night.  A Not Unsubstantial Amount Of Money.  And I Spent My Evening Experiencing An Atmosphere That I Could Have Had For £40 In The Brighton Branch Pizza Express.  The Suite We Stayed In Was Lovely.

However Service Was Difficult To Get  Offers Of Coffee And Toast Were Not Given As Soon As We Were Seated Or Even Soon After. We Had To Chase Staff Down For This. They Were Very Polite Once We Got Hold Of Them Though. Service Did Seem Relatively Hectic And There Was No Routine To Clearing Tables Etc. I Thought The Food Offering Could Have Been Improved If There Was Some More Local Produce. Quality Was Ok But It Didn't Seem Outstanding. On The Sunday The Room Was Very Busy And We Did Have To Wait For A While To Be Seated. The Room Did Feel Too Small To Accommodate Everyone.,The Restaurant,,,,Poor,Fair,Excellent,Fair,Poor,Poor,The Main Issue With The Restaurant Is The Prices. With The Level Of Pricing I.E. 2 Star Michelin Level  You Set Expectations Very High For Service And Food. Unfortunately The Experience Didn't Come Near This Level And That Left Me With A Feeling Of Being Being Duped. The Service Was Polite And Relatively Quick But It Was Not Personal  We Had Different Staff At Every Visit To The Table. When We Did Complain There Was No Real Effort To Understand Why Or Go Out Of Their Way To Understand What The Problem Was. Overall It Felt Like The Staff Were Inexperienced. The Food Arrived Worryingly Quickly After We Ordered It  Which Made Us Feel Like We Were Being Rushed. Our Starters Were Luke Warm As If They Had Been Pre-Prepared. One Was So Cold We Sent It Back. The Replacement Was Warmer But The Meat Element Had Suffered From Over Cooking. They Looked Stunning And At Over £12 They Should Do. Unfortunately They Did Not Deliver On Flavour. They Lacked Seasoning And A Depth Of Flavour That I Expect For Something Priced At This Level. Our Main Courses Were Better In Flavour Terms  But Not Stunning Which They Should Be For £30 Each. Again We Felt Rushed And When A Large Party Arrived At 9Pm It Became Clear Why We Were Being Hurried. I Could Accept All Of These Faults At Half The Price  But At This Level It Felt Way Over Priced.,,,,,,,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Facilities Were Very Good  Even Though They Were Busy.,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Yes,I Wouldn't Call It An Issue But The Impersonal Service In The Restaurant Was A Let Down For This Level Of Hotel And Price.,,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Fell Below,,The Hotel Fell Below Expectations Mainly Because Of The Price.

I Emailed To Find This Out And Did Receive A Quick Response. But It Would Have Been Helpful Have These Details When I Originally Booked  Then We May Well Have Been Able To Have Our Extra Treatment Around The Same Time As Each Other.
Arrival - It Would Have Been Nice If Someone Showed Us Where The Facilities Were Eg Spa  Bar Etc  Saving Us Wandering Around Like Lost Souls!,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,,,The Brasserie,,,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,All Staff Very Helpful And Friendly,,,,,,,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,N/A,Agree,We Did Not Know Where Anything Was At First.,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,No,,Renata And Ladies At Reception Were All Very Courteous.
Andre Helped Carry Our Bags To Our Car Without Hesitation.
Corrine And Sarah In The Spa  Very Courteous And Good At Their Jobs.,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Strongly Agree,Met,As We Had Booked Our Spa Break In Advance It Would Have Been Extremely Helpful If We Had Robes & Slippers In Our Room  So We Could Relax And Make Our Way To The Spa Ready For Our Treatments. A Small Paper Map Of Where Facilities Were In Hotel Would Be Handy  Although All Staff Were Wounderful  It Would Have Been Nice Not To Have To Ask Continually.
,Re Above : What Actually Happened For Us Was That We Left Our Room Laden With Bits And Pieces As We Did Not Know What To Expect. We Went Though A Door That We Believed To Be The Spa Treatment Area (Seeing Other Ladies Going To & Fro In Their Robes) Up Some Stairs To Be Greeted By Spa Staff  And Led Into A Room With Other Guests Waiting. They Were All Wearing Robes  So We Were The Odd Two Out. We Were Quickly Called To Our First Treatments. I Asked Corrine Why We Were Not Supplied With Robes Etc  She Fiirst Said Maybe Because We Were Not Having A Spa Day  I Said We Were Having That And Staying Overnight Too! She Went Out Of Her Way At End Of Treatment To Kindly Supply Us With Robes Etc. Apparently We Should Have Gone To Spa Reception Which We Did Not Even Know Existed. This Was To Be A Relaxing Spa Treat For My Mum  So It Was A Little Uncomfortable For Her (And Me) Carrying Around Clothes And Things Until We Found The Lockers. (Hence Robes Etc In Room).
I 'M Sure I Read That The Spa Rooms Would Have Been Finished For Our Stay On 20Th March. Our Treatments And The Made Up Guest Rooms Were Very Good But I Had To Ask For The 2X £5 Discount On Final Payment.
The 'Experience' Was Met All But For The Little Hiccup As Above. We Did Enjoy Ourselves  The Treatments  The Staff  The Food & Drink  The Room And The Service And Do Hope Very Much To Return Again.

When We Arrived To The Hotel Desk  We Were Highly Welcomed Upon Arrival.

From The Tiny Room With A Very Very Small Bathroom (Without A Bath - Even Though Your Website Advises All Rooms Have A Bath?) The Treatments Were Good But The Heat In The Pool Area Was Unbearable And The Service In The Brasserie Was Laughable All The Way From The General Waiting Staff To The Manager.,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Disagree,We Had A Voucher For The Friday Night Break And I Have Emailed The Code Though On Booking But Had Lef Thte Voucher At Home. The Girl Who Booked Us In Advised She Would Need To Check With Her Supervisor About This And Come Back To Us. We Heard Nothing  But Then On Check Out The Same Girl Presented Us The Bill Including The Full Spa Break. On Mentioning This She Said She Would Have To Check With A Supervisor (!?) And We Were Told We Would Be Charged The Full Amount And On Presenting The Voucher We Would Be Refunded. I Turned Up A Few Days Late And Was Left Waiting For Quite A While At The Desk While The Girl Went To Check.........,Disagree,Agree,Agree, Very Dusty Room. I Have A Picture Of The Glass Table In Our Room That Would Appear Not To Have Been Cleaned For Days. As Said Before - Very Small Room And The Bathroom Was Far Too Small.

The Waiter Reappeared And We Had To Ask For A Bottle Of Wine And He Took Our Order. Within 90 Seconds Our Starter Appeared.......! On Finishing This We Asked For A 10 Minute Break And Our Main Course Arrived Within 5 Minutes. I Have Never Felt So Rushed In A Restaurant.  We Found Ourselves Not Wanting To Put Down Our Cutlery In Case The Plates Were Taken! We Had Finished The Bottle Of Wine And Were Contemplating Another To Take Through To The Lounge When A Waiter Appeared And Whisked Our Ice Bucket Away And Deposited It At Another Table! Not A Word Said About Ordering Anything Else! We Mentined This To Another Waiter Who Eventually Sent The Manager Over Who Enquired If We Were Staying Another Night? We Advised No And Asked Why He Had Asked This And He Said If We Were We Should Consider Eating At The Fine Dining Restaurant..!?? We  Obviously Incorrectly Thought That A Brasserie At A Four Star Restuarant Would Be A More Relaxing Expereince Then A Fast Food Restaurant - But To Be Honest I Have Had Far More Relaxing Meals With My Children At Mcdonalds. ,,,,,,,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,N/A,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Hot Hot Hot.

Rooms Should Have A Bath Or If Not This Should Be Mentioned. The Heat In The Pool Area Again Shoyuld Be Easy To Rectify And Finally I Begrudge Being Asked To Leave A Gratuity For Drinks When A Non-Disclosed 10% Fee Is Added!

The Hotel Is Held Out As Being A Premium Hotel But The Level Of Service Fell Far Below What I Would Have Expected. On The Saturday I Wanted To Have A Drink In The Cocktail Bar  The Conservatory Bar Or Outside. I Could Not Find A Spare Seat Anywhere Due To The Amount Of People There For Afternoon Tea. For A Resident To Not Be Able To Find A Seat Anywhere In The Hotel Is Not Acceptable. After 30 Minutes Of Waiting I Eventually Found A Two Chairs For Myself And My Partner. It Then Took A Further 45 Minutes To Be Served And Have A Coffee Brought To Me. 

At Dinner That Evening In The Brasserie The Service Was Similarly Poor. The Staff Were Inattentive And I Had To Get Up To Find Someone To Ask For Drinks To Be Brought. Also  My Food Arrived And Was Not What I Had Ordered. It Was Not Taken Away And Took A Further 10 Minutes For My Correct Order To Arrive  All The While My Partner's Food Was Left On The Table Getting Cold.

All In All  The Service Was Very Poor And If Sopwell House Wants To Market Itself As More Of A Destination For Afternoon  With No Regard For Making Allowance For Residents To Be Able To Even Find Somewhere To Sit  Then This Should Be Made Much Clearer.,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,I Was Assisted By A Trainee Receptionist Who  While Very Pleasant  Was Slow And Not Able To Answer Simple Questions.

One Group Of Ladies Spent An Hour In The Jacuzzi Totally Oblivious To Others Wanting To Get In. A Gentleman Fell Down The Wet Steps And Hurt His Back While We Were There. The Lady Cleaning At The Time Just Carried On Without Asking Him If He Was Ok! I Ended Up Leaving The Spa Earlier Than Intended Because It Had Become So Busy. We Extended Our Room So That I Could Get Ready For A Wedding I Was Attending In The Afternoon. On Three Separate Occasions The Cleaners And Concierge Knocked To See If Our Room Was Available. Each Time We Told Them We Had Extended Our Room But They Still Continued To Knock.

1) Guttering Above The Entrance To Room 10 In The Mews Was Completely Blocked Leading To A Waterfall In Front Of The Door When Gaining Entrance In The Rain On Monday 7Th April. This Did Not Seem To Be A Recent Blockage And Should Have Been Noticed And Rectified.
2) On-Line Booking System. I Use The System To Book With A Corporate Code As Advised By Yourselves. Every Time I Make A Booking I Have To Add My Address And Contact Details. Then  Every Time I Arrive At The Hotel I Have To Give All Of My Contact Details Again  Wasting Both My Time And Your Staff's. When Queried It Is Apparently Just The Way The Booking System Works. Given You Are Trying To Sell Yourselves As A High-End Location I Find It Somewhat Lazy And Unprofessional To Simply State That's The Way Your Own It System Works.

Our Room Was Nice  Apart From Several Large Dried 'Personal' Hairs In The Bath Tub! We Did Not Use The Bath! (I Have Photographs As I Was Quite Disgusted)
Our Treatments Were Very Nice  We Both Enjoyed Them Despite The Fire Alarm Going Off For About A Minute Half Way Through The Massage.
My Husband Used The Gym And Was Impressed With The Staff And Equipment.
Around 6.30Pm The Fire Alarm Went Off Once Again For A Minute Or So  I Was Just Out Of The Shower And The Panic Wondering What I Needed To Do  Although Comical Now  Was Rather Annoying.

I Was Thoroughly Disappointed With Our Evening Meal. The Food Was Nice  Our Choice Of Wine Was Pleasing But The Service Was Such A Complete Let Down. 
I Felt Like I Was Being Served In A Motorway Service Station! The Waiter Rushed About  Hardly Looking Where He Was Going  He Whipped My Dinner Plate From Under Me When I Had Only Just Put The Last Mouthful Of My Meal In. We Felt Completely Rushed! The Table Next To Us With Four Ladies On However Seemed To Get More Attention Than Anyone  Several Members Of Staff Were Most Attentive To That Table  Most Noticable.
Breakfast The Next Morning Was The Same  Shoved In  Rushed Out. This Time It Was My Husbands Plate That Was Whisked Away As He Finished And While I Was Still Eating.
So  Despite Paying For Lunch We Left............

A Disappointing Experience For A Day That Was Very Special For Us. We Felt Like We Were Being Treated Differently As We Were On A 'Spa Break'  Like The Poor Relative. Maybe The Staff Should Be Reminded That £300 For One Night Is Alot Of Money!

This Is Something That Could Of Course Happen To Anyone. However  We Found The Receptionist's Attitude Ungracious  If Not Downright Rude  Which Is Not Something We Would Expect From A 5 Stars Hotel.
The Other Problem Was That The Spa Was Full Of Kids That Were Very Loud And Pretty Much Invaded Every Single Facility Available  Including The Jacuzzi Which Is Not For Kids Under 12.

My Burger Meat Was Very Dry And Crumbly  I Had To Smother It With Ketchup To Make It Palatable And My Partner's Steak Was Very Fatty With Hardly Any Meat. This Was Very Bad Quality For Sopwell House In My Opinion.  The Breakfast Next Morning Was Good. And My Room Was Very Nice. I Was Very Upset When At Around 10Am I Was Sitting On The Toilet With The Bathroom Door Open And One Of Your Staff Walked Straight Into My Room. I Had The Do Not Disturb Sign On The Door. Could She Not Read ?? I Was So Embarrassed And This Has Put Me Off In Wanting To Stay Again. The Stay Was Meant To Be A Pleasant And Stress Free Experience. We Paid A Lot Of Money For Our Stay  Evening Meal And My Spa Treatment. But Those Two Things Let Me Down Greatly.

The Treatments Were Lovely  As Was All The Food. The Disappointing Elements Of The Trip Was That There Were No Tea Or Coffee Facilities In The Room Or A Mini Fridge. The Worst Part Of The Stay Was That We Were Provided With No Complementary Drinking Water. We Had Driven To Sopwell House And On Arrival Were Quite Thirsty But There Was No Drinking Water Provided In The Rooms  We Also Had To Pay For Water With Dinner Even Though Our Stay Was Full Board. In Less Than 24 Hours We Spent £8.40 On Still Water And I Think It Is A Shame That Such A Nice Hotel Lacks The Initiative To Provide The Most Basic Of Complementary Services  Clean Water. ,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,The Receptionist Seem Very Confused At Both Check In And Out.,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Room 142.

The Power And Heat Of The Shower Were Excellent.
The Staff Were Polite.
The Sash Window That Actually Opened Was A Delight.
However  I Slept Poorly. This Was Due To The Presence Of A Smoke Alarm(?)Or Sprinkler(?) On The Ceiling Which Intermittently Emitted A Momentary Flash Of Bright Light. I Found It Very Disturbing  And Arrived At My Job Interview The Next Day Absolutely Exhausted. I Also Missed Breakfast Because I Had Slept So Badly I Found It Hard To Get Myself Up And Going In The Morning.
So Despite The Fact That Sopwell House Is Clearly A Beautiful Hotel  I'm Not Sure I'd Want To Stay Again. If You Can't Sleep At Night It Doesn't Matter Whether You're In Buckingham Palace Or The Travelodge On The M1.
One Further Thing... The Receptionist Who Greeted Me Was Delightful ~ Very Polite And Helpful. 
However  She Didn't Smile Much And Looked At Her Computer Screen During The Check-In Process More Than She Looked At Me. I Think Eye Contact Is A Really Important Element Of Good Manners  And Would Have Preferred Her To Pay More Attention To Me Than To Her Screen.,,,,Please See Section 6.,,,,Please See Section 6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Please See Section 6.,Please See Section 6.,,,Ms,Elizabeth,Murtagh,elizabethdeborahmurtagh@gmail.com,Sunday 27 April 2014,Monday 28 April 2014,,,,,,,,,,,

We Hand To Stand Around And Wait For Loungers  Whichbwas Such A Let Down As It Was Supposed To Be A Birthday Break And Also A Breakmaway From Our Young Children And Also To Chill Out As We Have Had Quite A Stressful Year And Really Needed To Unwind Which Was Very Difficult To Be Honest. You Could See Every Persons Disappointment As They Walked Into The Spa And Find You Have No Where To Go Really  Which Is Quite Intimidating When You Are Standing Around Semi Dressed And Feeling Very Awkward To Be Fair. The Spa Facilities Are Not Adequate Enough  I Would Describe Sopwell House As More Of A Hotel With Limited Spa Facilites  I Wouldnt Clasifiy It As A Spa Which I Was Under The Impression Of. ,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Yes,All Was Pretty Good Until We Checked Out And We Were Charged For A Spa Treatment That My Brother Had Pre Booked As A Surprise For My Birthday. The Lady Was Adament That No Payment Had Been Made  So I Had To Call My Brother Who Was Abroad At The Time And Explain The Situation  Which Was Very Embaressing For All Of Us As It Was Suggested I Pay For The Treatment And Then Get The Money From Him  Which Was Very Unprofessional And Quite Rude To Be Fair. After The Manager Calling The Spa (Although When I Said My Brother Had Paid Directly Via The Spa She Said That Wasnt Possible As All Payments Come Via Reception) Was She Implying We Were Lying  I Hope Not  As We Are Not That Type  And Would Embaress Ourselves Over £45!!!!!!!!!
The Spa Or The Manager  Not Sure As She Wasnt Very Helpful Then Said My Brothers Card Had Been Declined Over The Phone And Thats Why Payment Had Not Been Paid. I Can Assure You I Would Find It Very Unlikely My Brothers Card Would Ever Decline. And We Also Pointed Out To The Manager That If That Was The Case  Why Would The Spa Person Finish The Phone Call If It Had Declined  Surely She Would Have Waited For Card To Accept Payment Before Placing The Phone Down  And She Had His Contact Number  Why Not Call Him Back?!?!? Given They Knew It Was A Surprise Birthday Gift  You Dont Just Charge To The Persons Room. Very Unprofessional And Unacceptable.
,All Staff Were Helpful And Friendly Apart From That Very Last Check Out Issue.,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Fell Below,,Aside From All I Have Commented On  It Was Generally A Good Stay For The Money We Paid  Although The Issues With Checking Out Was Unacceptable Regardless Of How Much Money Is Paid. We Probably Wouldn't Come Back Again Which Is A Shame As Its A Lovely Hotel But If You Want To Come For A Spa Break To Chill Out Then Your Better Off Going Else Where. I Was Going To Be Visiting With 9 Girlfriends Of Mine For A Spa Break/ Get Together As We Do Each Year ( Visitors From Usa  France  Italy And Switzerland) But We Are Now Looking At Booking Elsewhere As Its Obvious You Would Not Be Able To Cater For Our Spa Needs.

The Brasserie's Food Was Very Good - We Were Impressed With The Service As Well Both For Dinner And Breakfast. The Menu Catered For Families With Young Children And We Appreciated This. We Also Liked The Cocktail Lounge.
However  We Were Not Notified When We Booked The Stay That The Lifts Were Out Of Order And On The Day Due To Refurbishments  We Had To Climb Two Flights Of Stairs With Two Young Children And Our Luggage  With Two Members Of The Family Moved To The Mews Apartment  Away From The Main Building. This Diminished The Whole Experience.

Staff Were Friendly And Helpful.,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,We Have Stayed At Sopwell Twice Before This Trip. We Have Always Booked A Standard Room And Been Very Impressed With The Size And Quality Etc. Having Checked In This Time  After Confirming This Was Our Honeymoon  We Arrived At A Much Smaller Room - Still Lovely But We Were Quite Disappointed.  Long Story Short  It Seems We Were Double Upgraded To Executive Suites On Both Our Previous Visits But Never Told So. This Was Great On Those Visits As We Didn't Pay For An Upgrade For Which We Are Grateful. But As We Didn't Know We Had Been Upgraded  We Came To Expect This Room As A Standard Room So Were Quite Dissapointed When We Received A Real Standard Room This Time.  Aside From The Size  This Particular Room Was Next To A Cupboard And A Busy Stair Well So Within 10 Minutes We Had Already Had Enough Of The Banging And Crashing Going On Around Us.  We Went Back To Reception And Were Helped Very Kindly (By Lucy I Believe) Who Explained That We Could Upgrade To A Superior Room Complimentary Or An Executive Room For Half The Normal Rate.  This Was Much Appreiciated And This Is When It Became Apparent That We Had Stayed In Executive Rooms Before.  Overall  We Were Happy To Pay A Little Extra For Some More Space And The Peace And Quiet Of This Other Room For Our Honeymoon.  This Experience Did Taint Our Visit A Little. Its Hard To Understand How You Could Have Upgraded Us Twice For Free Previously Without Even Mentioning It But On This Visit  Which The Hotel Knew To Be A Special Occasion  We Had To Pay For It.  ,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,Strongly Agree,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,,,The Brasserie,,,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,On Our First Night I Ordered The Smoked Trout Salad For Starter. When It Arrived There Seemed To Be A Lack Of Trout  However We Assumed It Was Cut Up Small And Mixed In With The Dressing Etc. On The Second Night  My Husband Ordered The Same Dish And It Was Apparent There Had Been No Trout With My Meal The Night Before.  His Dish Had Large Pieces Of Trout On Top Of The Salad And Lots Of Parmesan Shavings Mixed In. This Lead Us To Believe They Had Perhaps Run Out Of Trout And Parmesan The Night Before But Never Told Us.  If They Had  I Might Have Ordered Something Else.  Again  Overall The Dish Was Still Nice And This In No Way Ruined Our Experience But It Is Not Really The Kind Of Behaviour We Expected In Such A Nice Hotel. ,,,,,,,Strongly Agree,Agree,N/A,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,N/A,Strongly Agree,I Was A Little Dissapointed To Find There Was Hardly Any Treatments Below Approx £70. On A Previous Visit I Enjoyed I Believe A Half Body Massage Or Shorter Timed Back Massage For Around £40. I Would Have Liked To Have This Again But It Is No Longer Available It Would Seem.  I Appreciate This Is A Luxury High End Facility But It Would Be Nice To See Treatments To Fit All Budgets On Offer. ,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,No,,I Believe The Lady Who Rectified Our Booking Was Lucy.

We First Met Him On Friday 16/5 And Found Him To Be Highly Professional. We Were Reassured By His Professionalism / Attentiveness And Believe He Will Make Our Special Day A Fantastic Experience. I Would Also Like To Mention Jenny In Reservations Who Provides An Excellent Booking Experience As She Has Done For Many Years. If I Was To Make Any Criticism The Queuing At Check-In / Check-Out Has Always Been Tedious And Time Consuming.

It Was Obvious That The Restaurant Was Understaffed But There's Simple Ways Of Dealing With That Rather Than Ignore And Frustrate Guests.

I Had To Go To Reception And Tell Them That We Were Not Being Served After 20 Mins Of Standing At The Bar And Waiting. The Bar Was Very Busy. I Watched A Couple Leave And A Group Of Women Huffing As They Could Not Get Served. There Were A Few Staff About But None Of Them Acknowledged Our Being There Or Suggest How Long We Might Wait.

At 21.10 We Were Still Sitting Waiting And No-One Informed Us When We Would Get To Sit For Dinner. Only After Complaiing We Were Finally Offered A Complimentary Drink. It Was Not Until 21.40 That Our Table Was Eventually Ready. I Do Not Believe This Is Acceptable For A Hotel That Prides Itself On Its Service And Quality.

But The Special Touches Were Missing - I Stayed The Night Before And Was Placed Straight Over The Previous Wedding So Loud Music Kept Me Awake Most Of The Night. My Parents Arrived And When They Checked In They Were Given Details On Entertainment And The Reception Had No Idea They Were Booked For Their Daughters Wedding! We Had Left Money At Reception For The Speakers Man To Collect Before The Event- He Couldn't Locate It So On The Night Of The Wedding I Went To Reception To Ask About It- I Was Made Wait So Long I Had To Remind The Reception That I Was Missing My Wedding And Could They Perhaps Look And Then Bring Down The Envelope.  So Small Details Were Missed That Are In Fact Big Details. Nones The Less The Staff Catering He Wedding Were Exceptional And The Food Was Really Excellent - We Would Have Enjoyed Ourselves In A Field That Day!! But Feedback Wise I Did Think What A Pity.

This Year On Our Return It Was Completely Different- Despite A Very Long Check In Queue The Reception Was Warm And Friendly And Professional. The Room Was Stunning With A Card As A Nice Touch. The Meal Was Great And The Service Excellent. The Spa Was Busy But Really Relaxing. We Felt Spoilt  Valued And There Was A Genuine Warmth. Really Lovely And We Will Come Back Again Even Though We Only Live 10 Minutes Away!!!,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,I Did Request That For This Visits That We Not Be Given A Room Directly Above A Wedding! I Never Got A Response About This.

The Area Was Definitely Clean.
When U Entered The Spa Area All Seating Was Marked With Towels Or Robes But Clearly People Had Been And Left. 
One Area I Thought Could Improve Was That Someone Be Aware Of Who Is Where And Clear Chairs As Be One Available- As Lots Of People Arrived Into The Area With No Where To Place Their Belongings Despite In Fact Many Of The Seating Areas Being A A Available.
This Makes The Difference Between And Efficient Tranquil And Neat Spa Area V's A Messy Old Towels And Robes Everywhere- Massively Different First Impression . ,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,,No,On This Recent Visit Everything Was Really Exceptional,On Arrival A Very Warm Italian Lady Called Gracia I Think Greeted Us And Others As There Was A Queue.

I Have Stayed In Quite A Few Different Rooms Now And Definitely Prefer The Newly Refurbished Ones. The New Showers And Decor Are Excellent. There Is Sometimes An Issue With Noisy Fans. The Rooms Over Looking The Kitchen Are Noisy At Ground Level Due To This. Since My First Visit In Dec 2013 I Have Been Located On The Other Side On The 2Nd Floor - E.G Room 232. On This Occasion A Fan Constantly Started Up And Stopped And Appears To Be Catching On Some Ducting. This Fan Was Not The Heater / Cooler Unit In My Room But Possibly In The Corridor Or The Wc Extract System.

My Issue Was Really The Evening Meal Which Was Tired And Over Cooked  But Then To Have A Member Of Staff Knocking On My Door For Payment At 11.30Pm Was Completely Unacceptable.  I Was Using A Debit Card And When I Checked In Simply Stated That I Do Not Have A Credit Card  As I Am Sure There Must Be Others.  I Know The Waiter Was Only Doing His Job  But There Should Have Been A Duty Manager On Hand To Make A Simple Decision.  To Wake Guests Up With A Credit Card Machine Was Simply Woeful. Breakfast  Complete With Poor Quality Tissue Napkins  Was Wonderfully Disappointing.  A Little Tlc From The Duty Chef Would Ensure That Sausages Were Simply Not Scraped Off The Grill (Stuck Together In 3'S And 4'S) Before Being Dumped In The Chaffing Dishes.  But Then Again I Am Not A Fan Of Buffet Breakfast  Which Is Why I Usually Stay At A Hotel Where I Would Not Expect It To Be Served.

We Had No Idea And Were Not Told On The Phone That The Room Would Be So Small And For Just A Few Pounds More  Which Our Friends Paid  We Could Have Had A Comfortable Room With A Nice Outlook.  
When Telling The Manager She Could Not Do Anything Except Offer Us A Smaller!!! Room Which Was Of Course Not Acceptable  You Were Very Busy.
It Was A Shame That In Every Other Way  And Again I Commend Your Excellent Staff  We Had A Nice Time But The Room Would Make Us Think Again About Staying.

My Last Visit I Could Have Been At The Thistle For The Quality If Food And Room But Paid Well Over The Thistle Price.....We Have A Corporate Rate Of £55 At The Thistle But I Push To Stay At Sopwelll For The Great Service  Great Rooms And Cleanliness.....

On My Last Visit I Booked A Superior Room At £119 Per Night.....Was Told I Was Given A Upgrade To Amews Room....Which On The Website Is The Same Price So Nit Sure How It Was A Upgrade....The Room Smelt Bad  The Kitchen Area Is Old And Worn  The Boiler Door Was Wide Open  The Desk Was Stained And Not Nice To Work From  The Lounge Area Was Not Clean Or Comfortable.....Granted This Has Not Been Upgraded But To Say This Was A Upgrade Was Wrong....The Bath Room Is Not Any Where As Nice At The Main Rooms.

That Evening I Ate In The Restaurant And Was So Disappointed.
I Order A Caesar Salad With No Anchovies.....It Came Piled High With Anchovies  The Chicken Was Black From The Grill And It Had Barely Any Dressing......I've Worked In The Catering Industry For 30 Years And This Was Not Value For Money At £9.95

I Also Order A Rare Steak With New Potatoes And Rocket Salad.....It Came With Chips  The Rocket Was Limp And Hot After Having The Steak Dumped On Top  This Was Returned To The Kitchen Were I Watched The Chef Complain To The Waiter And Slap The Steak Onto Another Plate  Take The Same Limp Rocket And Soak In Balsamic Syrup And Add Some Pre Cooked Sautéed New Potatoes Which Where Greasy And Over Cooked......Worst To Come The Steak Was Well Done....
The Waiter Clearly Wasn't Interested So I Left....
The Next Day I Decided To Eat Locally But Have A Drink In The Room With A Colleague  When I Went Into The Kitchen Cupboard To Get A Glass I Could Not Believe The State Of The Glasses I Was Expected To Use.....I Reported This To Your Foh Manager Who Was Very Embarrassed......

Will I Be Back Honestly I Don't Know.....As I State The Thistle For Half The Price Could Be A Safer Bet....

My Last Revue For Sopwell Was How Good Your Service And Rooms Were  What A Contrast My Latest Visit Was.....

We Waited For An Hour For The Afternoon Tea As They Had Forgotten Our Order Manager Was Very Good And Chased It Up For Us.
We Had Friends Meeting Us At 5.30 For Drinks As This Was A Treat For My Husbands 65Th Birthday.
They Arrived In Terrace Area Before And Ordered Drinks.When We Arrived We Also Ordered More Drinks The Bar Staff That Served Us Was Badly Trained And Did Not Know How To Make A Lime & Soda There Was A Fuss Over The Wine Order And A Cider Was Also Ordered When Asked If He Had Ever Worked In A Bar Before Was Told It Was His First Week.My Husband Asked If He Could Take Off The Bottle Top And The Said Staff Member Replyed I Can't Find Opener  What Do You Want Me To Do Open It With My Teeth.As You Can Imagin My Husband Was Shocked By This Reply.At This Point Another Member Of Staff Came To Take Over Situation.
This Is The 6Th Time I Have Stayed At Hotel Over The Years My Daughter Stayed For Her Hen Weekend  There Were 10 Of Us At That Time.
As You Can Imagin This Has Made Us Think About Staying Here Again.
We Had Stayed At Limewood In New Forrest The Previous Weekend And Our Expieriance Could Not Have Been More Different.
We Are Business Owers Ourself's And Understand The Importance Of Customer Service Especially In The Hospitality Industry.
As We Live In Bournemouth And Travelled Some Distance For This Weekend We Were Disappointed.

We Upgraded Our Room Which In Itself Was Fine However Many Lights Were Not Working  The Radiator In The Bathroom Was Not Working And The Room Was Cold Overall.  Room Service Was Incorrect Whereby Only One Meal Was Sent So We Needed Up Eating At Different Times. 

The Room Was Situated Over The Conference Venue And There Happen To A Wedding On Whilst We Were Staying Which Itself I Have No Problem With   However The Music Could Be Heard In Our Room Until 1Am! To Top It Off We Were Then Disturbed My Room Keeping At 8Am Walking Into Our Room And Wake Us  Again A Error On There Behalf   I Feel Very Strongly That We Should Have Been Advised Of The Risk Of This Union Check In And Been Offered Another Room. 

Also In The Spa The Sauna Was Not Working And There Was Free Loungers As Many Had Towels/Robes Placed On Them However No Guests To Be Seen?! When We Did Many To Secure Loungers We Found On Two Occasions That Staff Had Removed Our Towels Whilst We Were Swimming Therefore A) Left Us Without Towels Or Robes And B) Again With No Loungers!

My Mum Rang Down And Asked For Some Water And Was Told It Would Be £6 So Didn't Bother Getting Any. Also We Were Booked Into Rooms Directly Over A Wedding Party  It Was Very Noisy. Even After The Music Finished There Was Loud Noise From Party Revellers Who Then Made Their Way Noisily Down The Corridor.It Was Around 3Am When Everything Calmed Down And It Really Did Spoil The One Night We Had Booked ... Had We Been  Staying A Second Night It Wouldn't Have Been So Disappointing. ,I Really Think When A Wedding Is Being Held  Guests Staying In Rooms Near By Should Be Made Aware And Even Offered A Little Compensation Such As A Bottle Of Wine In The Room If No Other Rooms Were Available. This Was The Only Thing That Let Our Stay Down ... Quieter Rooms Would Have Been So Much Better. But I Must Say The Hotel And Service Was Absolutely Brilliant ... The Staff Need To Be Made Aware Of Just How Good They All Are And The Chef .... What Can I Say ... Blooming Brilliant.

When I Queried Why  She Was Unsure And I Explained That I Had Booked The Room For My Husband's Birthday And Wanted The Mews Room.  She Didn't Say To Me "We Know You Booked... But Sorry We Have Had To Book You Into The Hotel  She Just Told Us That Was That". She Then Spoke To The Manager Who Came Out And Again Said The Same.  I Reiterated It Was For A Birthday Surprise And The Manager Then Said That It Was Because Of Maintenance Issues.  

She Did Offer An Executive Room Which We Accepted Because We Could Definitely Not Get The Mews Room We Requested.  The Manager Didn't Apologise The Receptionist Did.  However  When We Went To The Room  The View Was Overlooking The Side Car Park - Not The Picturesque Views We Had Wanted!  We Did Try To Change The Room Because Of This  But Nothing Was Available.

Whilst We Were Happy With Our Room And Could Not Fault It I Was Very Disappointed To Be Told We Couldn't Have The Room That I Had Booked And Only On Speaking To The Manager Were We Told It Was Maintenance Issues.  The Receptionist Was Just Happy To Book Us In The Hotel.  It Was Only That I Knew The Mews Room Was Not Part Of The Hotel Building Itself That I Picked Up On The Change.

We Did Have An Enjoyable Stay With You But As It Was My Husband's Birthday Surprise It Was Disappointing Not To Get What We Had Booked.  I Appreciate That Things Do Happen But I Think The Situation Could Of Been Handled Differently.

Many Thanks

,Agree,Agree,Agree,Met,No,I Think The Room Service Menu Could Be Broader And I Felt The Costs For Room Service (Especially Drinks) Was Disproportionately Expensive. I Have Stayed At 5 Star Hotels In Central London Where The Room Service Costs For Soft Drinks  In Particular  Weren't So High. In Comparison To How Reasonable Food Was Priced In Brasserie It Just Seemed Too Much. Consider A Few Cheaper Options To Encourage People To Use Room Service.

Sincerely Glad We Could Be Accommodated On Day We Did Arrive And Had Booking Confirmation For Otherwise Would Have Been Far Less Than Impressed.   Unfortunately Mix Up Continued When Presented For Dinner As Although We Had Been Allocated 7.30Pm Reservation The Restaurant Didn't Have Us On The List For That Day!  Otherwise And Despite An Agonising Back Pain I Arrived With  Our Stay Was Very Relaxing. Surroundings Are Comfortable  Facilities Good Though Did Wonder How Comfortable An Experience It Would Have Been Had We Visited At The Weekend - Envisage Spa And Changing Area Would Not Accommodate Larger Visitor Numbers So Well And Would Lose The Serenity Experienced On An Early Week Day.  Food Was Lovely And Staff Likewise.  Special Thanks To The Two Natalie's In The Spa For Their Patience During My Treatments Given I Had Mobility Issues Due To An Agonising Back Complaint.  They Left Me Feeling V Relaxed And I Found Them To Be Warm And Friendly.   In Summary  Stay  Staff  Facilities And The Weather Made For An Enjoyable And Relaxing Stay.  Would Like To Have Stayed Longer . ,Agree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Sorry Inadvertently Provided Answer To This In The Previous Section.,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Lovely And Spacious Room And Bathroom.  With A Crippling Back It Was However A Shock Having To Take Steep Stairs To Our 2Nd Floor Room.  If There Is A Lift We Were Not Made Aware Of The Fact.   I Didn't Mention My Back Problem As I Am Not One To Make A Fuss But I Was In Pain And The Spa Visit I Hoped Would Bring Relief. On Reflection And Considering There Were Guests More Senior In Years I Do Wonder How They Would Manage The Stairs.  Perhaps I Looked Healthy Enough To Take The Stairs?  My Mention Of This Really Is With A View To Staff Taking More Notice Of The Customer Which In My Experience Helps To Anticipate Needs Enabling Opportunity To Ensure First Class Customer Service  Not That The Level Of Service Was In Any Way Poor But There Is Room For Improvement.  A Bottle Of Water And Drinking Glasses On The Service Tray Would Have Been Welcome - I Found Just 2 Sachets Of Coffee On The Tray A Mean Offering  Ditto One Small Bottle Of Body Wash For 2 People.  Perhaps As Ours Was A Gift Voucher Booking (In Celebration Of A Milestone Anniversary) The Norm Is To Provide The Most Limited Of Room Compliments.  I Would Expect That Had We Requested More These Will Have Been Provided But The Point Is One Should Not Find The Need To.   ,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Strongly Agree,Agree,At Busy Times A Toasting Machine May Prove Beneficial And Enable Guests To Take Toast With Their Breakfast Than Encounter Delay Awaiting An Order For Same From The Kitchen.,,The Brasserie,,,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Fair,Good,Good,

Were Guest Numbers To Increase As We Were Told Is The Case When Really Good Deals Are Offered And At The Weekend  It Was Apparent From The Tranquility We Enjoyed That This Enjoyable Sense Would Be Threatened When There Is A Greater Numbers Of Guests Using The Spa  Pool  Jacuzzi  Steam Room And Sauna.  Some Spa Members Confirmed Our Thoughts As They Spoke Themselves Of The Negative Impact On The Ambience At Busier Times.   Just To Add That I Would Have Loved For There To Have Been A Blow Dry Bar In The Spa.   The Spa Decor Up To The Treatment Rooms Is Very Nice.,Strongly Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Yes,None Really Other Than The Booking Confusion That Resulted In Us Not Being Able To Visit On Our Preferred Date And Not Being Expected On The Day The Hotel Booked Us In For.,I Arrived With Agonising Back/ Hip Pain And The Two Natalie's In The Spa Were So Patient And Understanding - Due To The Pain I Was In It Took A While For Me To Be Able To Get To An Upright Position From Sitting Or Lying Down And Both These Young Ladies Were Very Patient With Me.  For A Middle Aged Lady Movement Was Particularly Painful When I Visited But I Enjoyed My Treatments And Found The Two Natalie's So Considerate  Friendly And Welcoming.   All Staff In The Spa Were Helpful  Informative  Down To Earth And Wholly Competent In Delivering A High Level Of Customer Service.  Their Approach And Service Delivery Are A Credit To The Hotel And Left Me Wishing I Could Have Stayed For Longer.,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Met,In The Main Expectations Were Met But For Reasons Outlined Within This Feedback There Is Room For Improvement If All Guests Are To Feel Genuinely Valued Customers.   ,The House And Grounds Are Beautiful And We Had A Lovely Stay And Fabulous Weather.. Comments Made Are Not To Criticise As There Is Much That Is Very Good At Sopwell And Are Intended To Be Viewed As An Honest And Helpful Point Of View.

It Would Be Nice To Find Information On The History Of Sopwell And It's House Within Guest Rooms. The Location Of The Secured Booklet On Display In Reception Is Not Well Thought Out. It Is Right By The Point At Which Guests Engage With Reception Staff And Limits Privacy Of Conversation If Someone Is Stood Reading The Book Alongside.  I Managed A Quick Read Of Some Pages Before Someone Approached The Desk Before Feeling Compelled To Give Space For Privacy In Their Conversation With Reception.  It Looks An Interesting Read But To Have It Fixed And No Apparent Alternative Format Of Interesting Content From It Around The Hotel I Think Is A Pity.

This Was Due To A Small Piece Of Glass Found In The Beef Stroganoff On The Day Of Our Departure Where My Guest Uncomfortably Removed It From Her Mouth.  Fortunately It Did Not Cut Her  But As You Can Imagine It Put Us All Off Our Food.  The Manager At The Time Was Very Apologetic And Did Not Charge Us For The Soft Drinks We Had  But I Feel My Guests May Try And Persuade Us To Go Elsewhere Next Year  Which Will Be A Shame.  I Appreciate These Things Happen And Will Still Push To Come To Sopwell House Next Year (Already Booked)  As In The Past We Have All Had Such Fun And The Treatments We Have In The Spa Are Wonderful.  Once Again I Must Praise Holly For Her Professionalism.  I Would Also Like To Say Although We Were Asked Not To Go To The Pool Until 2 Pm. As It Would Be Too Busy  It Was Actually Empty At That Time And I Feel That If We Were Allowed To Used The Facilities Sooner  We Would Not Have Felt The Need To Leave Sopwell House Soon After Arriving At Approximately 11.30 To Go To The Nearby Park For A Stroll.  This Was Also Due To A Wedding On Your Grounds Which Restricted Us Using Them.  However   If We Could Have Used The Facilities  As We Have Done So In The Past  We Would Have Happily Stayed At Sopwell And Had Lunch There.  I Feel It Is Necessary To Let You Know Of Our Disappointments At Sopwell House This Year.  With Kind Regards  Francesca Steadman

However  There Were Two Problems I Experienced. The First Is That On The 'Comments' Section When Booking I Mentioned That It Was My Girlfriend's Birthday And That If There Was The Possibility Of An Upgrade Or Anything To Make It Special That I Would Appreciate It. The Person Who Checked Us In Essentially Read This Request Out In Front Of My Girlfriend. It Was Highly Embarrassing For Me. This Information Should Have Been Treated Discreetly. Secondly  I Had Booked Afternoon Tea And Again  In Advance  Asked If There Was Anything That Could Be Done To Make That A Little More Special As It Was On My Girlfriend's Actual Birthday. I Got Told That "We Can Offer A Nicely Decorated Birthday Plate To Celebrate Your Girlfriend's Birthday On Sunday 6Th July At 14:00." This Didn't Happen. I Followed Up By Email With Lucila Ito And She Said She Would Look Into It And Would I Give A Few Days For Her To Respond. This Was On The 7Th July And To Date I Have Had No Reply.

Whilst I Appreciate That The Offer Was Made As A Kind Gesture  Not As A Standard  It Was A Shame That It Didn't Happen. I'm A Little Disappointed That It Couldn't Have Been Made A Little Bit More Special With A Splash Of Customer Service!

They Were Forgotten About When They Had Asked For A Cup Of Tea At The Bar  And Had Waited For 20 Mins Whilst They Watched The Bar Tender Serve Drinks For Others.  Then They Were Not Told That The Package I Had Bought Included Lunch.  When I Had Stayed Previously We Were All Told At Check-In That Lunch Will Be Served At 1Pm The Following Day.  So Unbeknown To My Parents They Checked Out At 11Am And Were Still Not Told Of The Lunch.

The Print Out Of The Confirmation Which I Had Given To Them Was Handed Over In Reception And Not Given Back.

I Then Found Out A Service Charge Had Been Added To The Bill Which I Contested. He Struggled To Understand Me And Eventually Just Said There Was Nothing He Could Do  It Was Done By The Hotel.

One Or Two Quirks  Mainly To Do With Information On-Site E.G. Very Few Signs And No Plans  Little Info In The Bedroom  Had To Ask Where The Spa Was And Where Breakfast Room Was Located.  
Breakfast: Hot Water Ran Out And Took Too Long To Replace After I Had Had To Ask  Which Shouldn't Be Necessry.  It Was A Busy Morning  But Only 2 Flasks Of Hot Water.  The Toaster Should Be In A Museum!  Otherwise  Good Food And Selection.  We Were Part Of A Family Wedding Group  But Only Afterwards Did We Learn There Was A 2Nd Breakfast Room And That Some Of Our Family Were In Another Room.  We Were Really Disappointed About This  And Heard Other Guests (Not Our Party) Making The Same Comments.  Some Family Members Who We Don't See Often Had Travelled A Long Way And We Missed Spending Time With Them Because Of The 2 Breakfast Rooms.  The Hotel Could Learn From Cheaper Hotel Chains About Breakfast Service.
Spa Was Lovely - When We Found It!  Again  No Signs.  Once Past The Spa Reception  We Had To Ask Other Guests Where The Changing Rooms Were And Both Of Us (Female & Male) Missed Seeing The Baskets For Used Towels In The Changing Rooms. 
Check-Out Took Far Too Long.  The Hotel Must Have Known How Many People Were Staying For One Night On Account Of The 2 Wedding Parties.  We Were Not There At The Last-Minute  But There Was No Facility For Quick Check-Out For Those Who'd Pre-Paid  So In Front Of Us There Were Guests Who Were Paying  Booking Taxis Etc. Which Delayed Us Unnecessarily.  Surely There Could Be A Quick Drop-Off  Followed By E-Mail Receipt?  We Weren't In A Particular Rush  But It Was Irritating That A Member Of Staff Was Being Used To Chat To Waiting Guests ('Have You Enjoyed Your Stay?' Etc.) Instead Of Used To Reduce The Queue!  Overall  We Found Staff To Be Friendly And Helpful. 
We Really Liked The Hotel And Hope To Find A Reason To Visit Again.  I Was About To E-Mail With These Comments  Before Receiving This Form.

Although I Have Stayed In A Few Hotel / Spa Resorts  This Was My First Stay At Sopwell And I Can Honestly Say That On A Personal Note I Have Never Been So Impressed With Every Aspect Of A Hotel / Spa. 
Starting On Arrival  The Staff Were Extremely Professional And Polite. The Rooms Were Immaculate  Spacious And Exceeded My Expectations. Every Member Of Your Team Were Beyond Helpful No Matter What The Request And Carried Out Their Duties With A Smile. The Spa Facilities  Restaurants And Bars Were Welcoming  Comfortable And To An Extremely High Standard. The Grounds Were Perfect And The Food Was Amazing From Breakfast To Dinner.

As For The Wedding Itself  I Must Say That The Whole Day Went Like A Dream And I Know The Bride And Groom Were Amazed At How Professional And Accommodating All Of The Staff Were  With A Special Mention To Joe (The Wedding Coordinator) The Only Issue I Believe Was With Brides Breakfast (Which Was Organised To Be For Her And The Bridesmaids In The Brides Suite) I Understand Was Rectified Asap.

All In All I Would Have To Rate This As One Of The Most Relaxing And Comfortable Weekends Away And I Am Sure I Will Be Returning In The Near Future.

On A Separate Note  As I Mentioned Earlier I Have Stayed In A Fair Few Hotel / Spa Resorts  Which Has Been Down To My Occupation. I Currently Employed As A Senior Member For One Of The Largest Interior Fit Out Companies In The Uk And Regularly Work In Partnership With Exclusive Hotels Throughout The Uk And Europe.
I Must Say That The Mattress In My Room (106) Is The Most Comfortable I Have Ever Experienced And Would Like Experience That On A Nightly Basis. I Would Be Very Appreciative If You Able To Speak To Your Procurement / Purchasing Manager And Provide Me With The Suppliers Details.  I Am Sure That Purchasing Will Have O&M Manuals For All Of The Items In The Rooms.

Once Again Thank You To All Of The Staff For Making This Such A Great Weekend.

I Look Forward To Hearing From You And Returning Soon

Kind Regards

This Is Indicative Of The Poor Administration And Miscommunication I Frequently Experience With Sopwell House!,Agree,Agree,Agree,One Small Shower Gel And One Small Shampoo Isn't Really Enough For Two Guests Sharing A Room.,No,Yes,Yes,No,,,,,,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,It Took An Age To Be Seated  Despite Several Free Tables Available.  We Were Ignored By Staff And In The End I Had To Go Up To Someone And Tell Them I Was Sitting Myself Down.  Staff Were Too Busy Clearing Tables And Getting Ready For Lunch Service - It Was Only 10Am!  There Was No Crockery (Plates  Cups Or Mugs) So I Had Nothing To Put My Buffet On!  There Was No Coffee And No Hot Water.  I Had To Hunt Down A Member Of Staff And Request All Of These Things.  And I Had To Do This Several Times Before Anything Was Replenished.  They Made Me Feel Like I Was A Nuisance And Everything Was Too Much Hassle For Them.  A Very Unimpressive Experience.  What Little Food Was There Was Very Average As It Was Cold And Had Been Sat Out For Ages.  ,The Restaurant,,,,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Sadly The Main Courses Were Incorrect And One Dish Had To Be Sent Back.  It Meant One Diner Had No Food While The Rest Of Us Ate And His Meal Arrived After We Had Finished.  Once Again It's The Same Old Story With Sopwell House  The Product Is Good  The Service/Delivery/Attention To Detail Is Lacking!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Yes,Check-In And Breakfast - Both Already Covered In Earlier Questions.
I'm Not Sure Whether I Would Return To Sopwell House Even Though I Have Been A Frequent Visitor For Many Years.  Standards Are Slipping And Having To Explain Things And Hunt Down Members Of Staff Is Tiresome And Certainly Not What I Would Expect To Have To Do!,The Waitress Who Served Us For Some Of Our Dinner Was Very Friendly And Helpful.,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Fell Below,Get Your Booking System Sorted.

We Found This A Very Unusual Situation. We Were Only A Party Of Eight And Do Not See Why We Should Be Expected To Chose Our Meals In Advance  We Therefore Refused To Accept This And Said That We Would Chose When We Arrived In The Normal Manner. When We Arrived We Found That The Menu Was Different From That With Which We Had Been Supplied So We Don't Know How It Would Have Worked If We Had Chosen Our Meals When We Were First Asked To. The Menu Gives A Useful And Accurate Guide To How A Steak Should Be Cooked Depending On The Taste Of The Person Ordering  It's A Shame That The Chef Hasn't Read It !! A Rib Eye Steak That Was Ordered Rare Was Served Well More Than Medium. It Was Sent Back And The Replacement Was Correctly Cooked But It Does Not Reflect Well On The Kitchen. The Steak I Ordered Was Also Significantly Overcooked Although I Chose Not To Add To The Issue By Sending That Back Also. The Staff Were Obliging And In The End We Had An O.K.

The Brasserie Dinner Was Lovely  Great Food But Don't Feel Like We Were Looked After And We Had To Ask Someone To Take Our Order Because No One Came To Us. The Wine We Ordered Came Warm And We Had To Ask For Another Bottle As The Ice Bucket Could Not Cool It In Time Before We Opened The Bottle. 

The Conservatory Was Lovely And We Ate Lunch Outside On Arrival. We Had A Nice Waitress But All The Tables Outside Are Rocky On The Slate Floor Which Was A Pain And We Noticed There Were Plates And Glasses That Had Not Been Cleared From The Day Before On Our Second Day Stay.

The Service In The Cocktail Lounge Was Pretty Shocking To Be Honest. I Sat Myself Down At An Empty Table And There Was One Gentleman Running Around Like A Maniac Very Flustered Trying To Set 1 Table Up For Guests. He Continued To Ignore Me For About 10 Minutes Before I Managed To Ask Him For A Menu. He Took One Of The Chairs Away From My Table For Another Table Without Asking And I Had Friends Joining Me. The Food Was Great  It Came In Good Time But Just Felt Like Again The Service Could Improve. 

We Then Had Drinks In The Cocktail Lounge After Arriving Back From Dinner Elsewhere. We Waited And Waited And Waited To Be Served And Then Waited Even Longer For The Drinks To Arrive. We Went To The Bar To Ask If We Should Expect The Drinks And She Started Making Them There And Then Having Clearly Forgotten.

Loved The 5 Star Treatment Without The 5 Star Price. Liked That The Hotel Wasn't Too Big. Felt More Exclusive.
Room Was Great  Nice Décor  If A Little Small For A Single But Not Unexpected. Would Have Been Nice To Have A Bath And A Fridge But Realise Short Of Space.

One Big Disappointment - Room Service Dinner And The Response To My Feedback. I Have A Number Of Dietary Restrictions And So Ordered Soup Without Bread And A Large Mixed Salad With Grilled Chicken And A Sparkling Water. I Got A Bowl Of Not Very Warm Soup  A Massive Basket Of Bread  And A Piece Of Chicken On A Plate Of Lettuce. So  Soup  Chicken And Lettuce For 30 Pounds. When I Expressed My Concern Upon Checking Out  I Was Assured That Someone Would Call Me That Day And I Gave The Receptionist My Mobile Number. No-One Rang. The Following Day I Received An Email Requesting My Contact Details To Which I Duly Replied. Still Nothing. Very Disappointing. I Travel A Lot For Work And Frequently Order Room Service And  In Terms Of Value For Money  This Was One Of The Worst. I Did Order Room Service Breakfast And That Was Delicious.

When We Told Him It Was Our Mini-Honeymoon Weekend  He Also Very Kindly Offered Us A Complimentary Glass Of Prosecco. He Needn't Have Done This  But It Was A Lovely Gesture And It Was Followed Through. Essentially  This Was The Best Experience We Have Ever Had On Arrival At A Hotel - And It Set The Scene For The Rest Of Our Stay. As My Husband Is Spanish  Vincenzo Kindly Introduced Us To Marco (? - Apologies If I Have Not Remembered The Correct Name!) Who Is Also Spanish And Helped Us With Our Baggage To The Room. My Husband Was Particularly Overwhelmed On Seeing The Football Gallery And Finding The Flag And Photos Of His Favourite Team (Barcelona!). We Enjoyed The Spa  Whilst Slightly Busy Being The Weekend  The Facilities Were Very Well Kept And Clean. We Enjoyed Dinner In The Brasserie  Food Very Well Prepared And Pleasantly Presented With Quick Service. The Cocktail Bar - Some Of The Best Cocktails We Have Ever Tried! We Would Come Back Even If Not Staying For An Evening Just To Experience The Cocktails With Friends. Breakfast Equally Surpassed Expectations With A Range Of Selection To Choose From.

   Waist Of Time. 
- We Understand That It Is Opened To The Public But The Minimum Standard Of Prioritising Your Guest Was Not There.

A Nightmare Of A Diet But We Did Phone And Let You Know. It Is Gluten And Dairy Free And There Is Quite A Lot Of Fruit  Vegetables And Additives That I Cannot Tolerate In My Diet. We Were Assured On The Phone That It Would Not Be A Problem. I Have Only Recently Had To Go On This Diet For Health Reasons So I Did Have My Doubt About Keeping Our Booking. But My Husband Phoned You To Explain As He Was Really Keen For Us To Be Able To Have This Break As He Knew It Would Do Me Good. 
Went Down For Dinner. My Dietary Needs Had Been Noted Which Was A Relief. Explained About My Diet Whereby The Server Pointed Out One Dish That Was Suitable - Well That Is Hardly A Menu? For People With Dietary Needs. That Is One Option - Take It Or Leave It. So We Asked If I Could Have Something Different That Was Not On The Set Menu. I Asked For Plain Steak And Chips With No Sauce Or Anything Added To It. Was Told Yes That Was Fine But We Would Have To Pay The Difference Which Was Acceptable I Suppose (Didn't Really Have Any Other Choice). We Were Asked If We Wanted Water On The Table Which We Said Yes. The Upshot Of This Was When Our Bill Arrived It Would Not What We Were Expecting At All  Considering The Set Menu Was Part Of Our Stay. I Was Charged For A Side Salad - I Literally Had Steak Chips And A Couple Of Bits Of Lettuce. When We Queried It  I Was Told I Had A Side Salad. No I Had It In Place Of The Vegetables Offered As I Could Not Have Them And We Did Explain This At The Time. Ridiculous. The Price You Charge For Bottled Water Is Very High - We Did Not Realise We Were Paying For Water. We Were Charged For Other Substitutes. I Appreciate If You Go Away From The Set Menu There Would Be Charges But We Were Charged For Every Little Thing. Not Impressive When We Were Assured When We Originally Phoned Up  We Were Told Yes No Problem We Cater For All Dietary Requirements. Yes At A Cost You Do. No Reflexibility At All.

We Were Allocated A Twin-Bedded Room (Room 151) Which Was Very Nicely Furnished And Decorated With A Beautiful View Over The Countryside. Regretfully The Date We Chose To Stay Was Extremely Busy In Both The Hotel And Spa/Treatment Areas. The Reception Meet/Greet For The Spa Was Very Unfriendly And Was Not Particularly Helpful. We Had To Explore The Facilities On Our Own And Felt That This Really Let Down The Overall Pampering Experience. We Felt Very Much A Number Rather Than A Guest. The Swimming Pool And Sauna Was Extremely Overcrowded With No Available Loungers.
In The Evening We Had Pre-Dinner Drinks In The Bar And Again The Service Was Poor And It Was Not The Atmosphere That You Felt You Wanted To Stay To Relax And Enjoy A Few Drinks.
The Evening Restaurant And Staff Were Extremely Good And The Set Menu Offered A Nice Variety Of Choices. Breakfast Was Also Very Good. 
Overall The Hotel Was In A Superb Location And The Grounds Very Well Kept. I Would Like To Re-Visit At A Time When The Hotel Was Not So Busy Just To Enjoy The Excellent Facilities On Offer  But In A Quieter Period So As To Enjoy The Ambience And Relaxation.  ,Agree,Agree,Agree,Overall A Good Experience At Check-In/Arrival,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Excellent - Thank You,No,,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,The Brasserie,,,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Very Good,,,,,,,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Strongly Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Felt The Reception And Orientation Really Let The Experience Down.

A Positive Comment Is That My Friend Commented That Her Masseuse/Facial Was The Best That She Had Ever Experienced - Her Name Was Charlotte !

Finally We Were Given Milk That Had Been Left On Another Table Since The Guest Had Departed  Not Ideal  But Was Okay. The Manager Apologised And Was Very Helpful Following That.

Also My Friend Left Her Iphone In The Robe Pocket By Accident And The Staff Located It Within 5 Minutes And Brought It Into The Restaurant To Us  Which Was Really Nice. The Facilities Are Really Good  Just One Thing I Would Say Which Seemed To Be Causing Tension  Bed Hogging With Towels - Yes I Happens Everywhere  But At Other Spa's I Have Been To They Have Signs Telling People Not To Do It  And Staff Should Come And Clear Towels From Unattended Beds If They Have Been There For A Long Time. 80% Remained Empty But Full Of Towels For Most Of The Day On Sunday  And There Were People Too Afraid To Move The Towels  Even Though The Beds Were Clearly Not Being Used. Just A Sign In The Area Asking People Not To Do It Would Give Others The Confidence To Feel They Are Able To Go And Sit There.

However  Our Second Night For Dinner Was A Disaster We Were The First People There And Over Three Hours Later Others Had Arrived Later Ate And Left Before Us. The Main Problem I Feel Was No Staff Allocated To Our Table Of Ten. The Young Adults On Our Table Did Not Like The Set Menu And I Asked For Bigger Children S Meals. We Were Offered The Brasserie Menu But Told A Value A Totally Unrealistic Amount Of £20.00 Each !!!! Was Not Happy At That Amount At All  Soup Is £7.50. The Older Kids (Paid Adult Price) Still Wanted Kids Meal And I Asked Could They Just Have More Chips  Their Meals Finally Came Wrong  And Had To Be Returned  A Young Fella Was Sent Over To Explain The Pudding Was A Set Size  I Said Ok Suggesting Two Scoops Of Ice Cream Not One ( It Didn't Happen). Every Part Of The Meal We Had To Ask What Was Happening. My Parents Were Uncomfortable Sitting At Table After Two Hours And We Spent Lots On Extra Drinks. When We Finally Got The Bill I Was Shocked At The Service Charge And Challenged The Lady At Desk Did She Think We Had Received Any Real Service And She Agreed It Had Not Gone Well. After Over Three Hours I Was Unhappy And Asked That The Service Charge Be Removed  I Was Disgusted That I Had To Ask As She Knew We Were The First In That Night And The Waiting Around.

2621,Complete,24/11/2014 08:26,,Meeting Or Event,,,,,,,,,,Corporate Booking,,,,,,,,,,,Corporate Booking,,Fair,No,Maybe,I Though The Quality Fo The Food Was Good.. However  The Accommodation Was Poor. The Room I Was Assigned To Was Very Small And Overlooking A Roof.

My Main Concern However Was That I Was Givent He Wrong Key To A Room That Was Occupied By Another Person That Was Attending The Conference. When I Went Up To What I Believed To Be My Own Room I Walked In On A Male Taking A Shower. To Be Honest At The Time I Was In Shock. I Returned To The Reception Area To Let Them Know What Happened. While They Did Apologise And Offered A Late Checkout If Require Free Of Charge And Apologised Again When I Was Leaving I Felt That It Was Too Little Offered.

I Was Originally Concerned For My Colleague Who I Walked In On As He Was Extremely Embarrassed. However  I Feel That Insufficient Concern Was Shown To Me. I Am Only Glad That It Was Not The Other Way Around And He Did Not Walk In On Me.

So As You Can See My View On The Stay In Your Hotel Is Coloured By The Events Of The First Evening.

While I Accept That It Was A Mistake You May Need To Review How Keys Are Issued To Custoemrs Attending Corporate Events Going Forward.

Regards.

The Purpose Of Our Visit (9 Guests) Was To Get Together As A Group Of Friends To Play Bridge.  I Had Visited The Hotel Prior To Our Stay To Ensure That It Would Be Alright For Us To Play Bridge In A 'Lounge Area'.  We Kept Our Stay Short In Order Not To Become A Problem.  We Arrived At 4.15 On Saturday Afternoon And Left At 2Pm The Following Day.  We Played Bridge From 5Pm To 8Pm In The Conservatory On Saturday - When It Was Empty - And On Sunday Morning From 9Am - 1Pm - Again It Only Started To Become Busier At 12Pm.   We Were Made To Feel Slightly Unwelcome Regarding Our Playing (2 Tables Of 4 People Each).  We Had Dinner  Bought Drinks And Teas/Coffees And Snacks.  We Did Not Use Or Take Up Any Other Facilities.  Whilst Our Stay Was Lovely And The Hotel Superb.  We Were Made To Feel As Though We Were Slightly In The Way  With Several Comments About The Fact That The Hotel Is Not A Bridge Club.  Our Playing Bridge Was A Means Of Getting A Bunch Of Friends Together.
