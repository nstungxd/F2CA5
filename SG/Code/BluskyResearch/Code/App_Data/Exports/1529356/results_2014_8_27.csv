,----------------------,,,,,,
,1,It Was Perfect. We Got Engaged In The New Forest And The Hotel Was The Perfect Place To Help Us Celebrate.,,,,,
,2,Fantastic Experience  Spa Was Out Of This World. My Wife Said It Was The Best Massage She Has Ever Had! :) Only Staying One Night Meant We Only Got To Try One Of The Restaurants And Although The French Bistro Was Immense  We Would've Liked To Try The Manor Restaurant Too...,,,,,
,3,Failed To Deliver A 4 Star Experience And Felt A Little Dated And Old Fashioned At Times.  ,,,,,
,4,A Very Nice Stay  With Great Service And Food...Staff Were Very Friendly And Very Helpful,,,,,
,5,Room Excellent Senspa Excellent Zenspa Restaurant Very Poor,,,,,
,6,I Have Stayed At Cary's Manor A Few Times Now And Each Time Has Been A Great Experience. I/We Escape To Cary's Manor To Get Away From The Every Day Hectic Schedule That Is Our Lives With Children And Each Time We Really Feel That We Have Truly 'Escaped' To Another World! The Staff Are Very Friendly And Attentive Without Being Intrusive And I Would Definitely Recommend This Hotel To Friends And Family.,,,,,
,7,Not As Good As Usual. Really Disappointed That The Spa Was Full When We Got There. The Receptionist Said That We Were Notified In An Email Confirmation Of This  But The First Email Confirmation Didn't Mention It - It Was Only In Small Print In An Attachment Sent Later On - We Were Extremely Disappointed And Felt It Should Have Been Made More Obvious. We've Never Had Problems Getting Into The Spa Before And This Really Spoiled Our Weekend. Breakfast Wasn't Very Good - Chewy/Soggy Hash Browns  Slimy Bacon And Waitress Seemed In A Hurry To Snatch Plates Away Before We'd Finished Chewing. We Couldn't Arrange A Late Checkout  Which We Hope We Could Do To Make Up For The Lack Of Spa Facilities. Carey's Has Always Seemed Like Good Value Before  But This Weekend Was Very Disappointing And Made The Price We Paid Seem Really Expensive/Overpriced.,,,,,
,9,In General  Every Area Exceeded Our Expectations. The Spa Was Spotless And A Beautiful Relaxing Environment (On A Previous Visit It Had Been Almost Unbearably Busy). The Service In All Areas In The Spa And Hotel Was Impeccable  From Therapists To Receptionists And Room Service. The Single Area That Was Slightly Disappointing Was Breakfast; Good Coffee & Juice But Pastries That Were Nearly Stale. It's Minor And As A Result Of How Impressed We Were With Everything Else  It Feels Like Being Very Picky To Mention It. A Great Stay  Lovely Personal Touch With Chocs And A Balloon For Our Anniversary In Our Room On Arrival Too. Great White Company Products In Room (Although Should Senspa Products Be Offered Now?) We'd Definitely Recommend. ,,,,,
,10,A Pleasant And Luxurious Break,,,,,
,11,My 50Th Birthday Was A Very Special Occasion For Me And Spending My Day At The Senspa With My Wonderful Husband Was Just Perfect. We Then Enjoyed Afternoon Tea And A Fantastic Dinner At The Manor Restaurant. My Bedroom Was Perfect Too As The View Of The Garden Was Beautiful Especially With The Autumn/Winter Colours. Yes To Summarize For You It Was Bliss  Perfect And Special And Luxurious And I Felt Very Special.,,,,,
,12,Relaxing And Enjoyable. A Very Easy Place To Be.,,,,,
,13,Not As Good As Usual. We Discovered When We Arrived That The Spa Was Full - We Were Very Disappointed As We'd Never Had That Problem Before. We Were Told We'd Been Advised By Email  But There Was Nothing In The First Booking Confirmation I Received  Only A Small  Very Missable Sentence In An Attachment In The Second Confirmation. We Hoped To Arrange A Late Checkout  But Weren't Able To. Breakfast Wasn't Great  With Soggy/Chewy Hash Browns And A Circling Waitress Who Swooped To Clear Plates Before We'd Finished Chewing. Our Stay Seemed Very Expensive And Overprived This Time  When Previously It Has Seemed Like A High Quality Luxury That Was Fairly Priced.,,,,,
,14,Top Quality Hotel  Wonderful Atmosphere  Wonderful Attention To Detail,,,,,
,15,Very Nice Place. Good Feeling. Close To Brockenhurst Town So Lots Of Options For Eating Out Etc.,,,,,
,16, The Spa And The Treatments We Had Were Excellent And The Staff In The Spa Were Welcoming And Knowledgable. This Part Of The Break Was Faultless.Sadly The Hotel Experience Did Not Match It.There Seemed To Be Great Confusion From Our Arrival In Regards To Our Rooms  This Delayed Our Start Timein The Spa And Then Our Dinning Experience Was Truely Marred By The Manager Of The Brasserie Telling Us  After We Had Eaten We Should Use The Remainder Of Our Voucher In The Hotel Bar  As We Had Over £40 Left Oin Our Allowance…When We Got There We Were Rudely Told" No" By The Duty Manager  And That We Could Not.As It Was My 40 Birthday I Was Disapointed And It Spoilt What Had Otherwise Been A A Super Day.On Checking Out There Was Also Great Confusion Over The Bill And One Of My Guests  Who Has Received No Treatments Had Been Charged  And We Had All (4) Been Charged With Tips On Treatments Different To The Amounts We Had Genuinely Left…In The Hotels Favour I Might Add.This Really Was A Shame .It Seems That There Is A Lack Of Clarity In Communication Between Spa And Hotel. These Issues Aside  Like I Expressed Earlier The Spa Itself Was Wonderful On Every Level ..At Least.,,,,,
,17,Very Good Overall  All Hotel Staff Very Friendly And Efficient. Restaurant Staff Need Better Customer Service Training ,,,,,
,18,Stayed At The Manor Suite. The Private Terrace Was Slightly Unkept E.G. Spider Webs. It Was Also Quite Dark At Night  Quite Dangerous When Going Up And Down The Stairs. Other Than That The Staff Were Helpful And Friendly. And The Room Was Remarkable. Thank You,,,,,
,19,Excellent Facilities And Wonderful Staff. Unfortunately We Had Very Noisy Ppl In The Room Next Door To Us Who Kept Us Awake Until The Early Hours Of The Morning Which Was A Shame. We Stayed In Room 37 And The Noise Was Directly Next Door In Room 36 :( ,,,,,
,20,A Very Welcoming Hotel And Spa Experience.,,,,,
,21,Staff Friendly Food Very Nice Service Good But Room Was A Disappointment For The Money Paid. Didn't Have A Remote Control For The Tv...Rang Reception....Took Over An Hour Before Someone Came With 2 X Remotes...Neither Of Them Worked....Person Then Returned 10 Minutes Later With Correct Remote. Toilet Bowl Was Leaking All The Time...Toilet Handle Was Faulty ,,,,,
,23,It's Always Lovely  Great Service And Amazing Spa & Treatments. ,,,,,
,24,Enjoyed Our Brief Stay. Staff Very Friendly And Helpful. However As It Was Just For One Night. The Meal In The Evening Was Good But Not Particularly Memorable. The Breakfast Was Very Disappointing The Plates Were Cold The Food Had Been Prepared In Advance The Bacon Lukewarm And Brittle The Eggs Were Rubbery And  Congealed The Tomatoes And Mushrooms Lukewarm And Un-Appetising And It Is Very Annoying Having To Make The Toast. ,,,,,
,25,It Was A Very Relaxing Weekend That Was Exactly What We Wanted,,,,,
,26,Very Pleasant Stay With Friendly Staff Service,,,,,
,27,Spa Is Great  The Hotel Good  But Overall Very Very Expensive For What You Get. The Restaurant Food Is Beautiful And Staff Were Great But The Room Was Devoid In Atmosphere And The Pianist Wasn't To Our Taste,,,,,
,28,Very Relaxing Time - Staff Were Very Attentive And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. Bedrooms Were Very Comfortable And The Leisure Facilities Very Good.,,,,,
,30,Very Good Except The Evening Meal In The Fine Dining Restaurant The Steak Was Very Poor Quality,,,,,
,31,Brilliant Customer Service And Relaxed Atmosphere,,,,,
,32,A Very Relaxing Experience. All The Staff Were Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,33,Very Nice Although I Would Not Stay In The Rooms Leading Off The Main Staircase As Noise From The Reception Area Woke Us Up A Couple Of Times During The Night. ,,,,,
,34,A Very Mixed Experience. My Girlfriend Has Already Spoken To The Manager About This. In Summary:  1. Some Staff Were Polite And Extremely Helpful  Others Were Rude. An Example Was When My Girlfriend Asked For Another Room Key. The Conversation Went Like This: Gf: "Could I Have An Extra Room Key Please?" Staff 1: "Yes  That Won't Be A Problem" Gf: "Ok  Well Could I Have One Then Please?" Staff 1: "Yes  You Can" Gf: Baffled Silence As Staff Member Just Stood There Staff 2: "She Is Waiting For Your Name And Room Number!" Staff 1: "I'm Not A Mind Reader!"  So  She's Not A Mind Reader  But Expects My Girlfriend To Read Her Mind In Order To Understand What Information She Needs To Make This Happen!  2. Room Was Not What I Would Have Expected For £248 Per Night. A Cushion On The Sofa Has A Large Stain; The Shower Leaked Onto The Floor; The Bathroom Door Had Water Damage From The Leaky Shower; Paint Was Chipped Off Around The Ac Vent Etc. When I Mentioned The Stain On The Sofa To A Staff Member  They Asked Me Whether It Needed Cleaning Or Replacing And Asked Me What I Wanted To Do About It! Your Staff Should Not Be Asking Me How To Resolve These Problems. They Should Just Send Someone Out To Deal With It. They Should Also Not Deal With It By Just Turning The Cushion Over!!  3. The Quality Of The Breakfast Was Poor. The Eggs Were Served With Excessive Amounts Of Water (Poached And Scrambled). The Vegetarian Sausages Were Burned And Tasteless.  4. The Food In The French Restaurant Lacked Taste. The Fish Cakes Were Also Burnt.  5. When We Arrived  We Had To Wait About 20-30 Minutes Before We Were Able To Check In. In The End  We Waited In The Bar.  It Was Not All Bad. A Number Of Staff Members Were Extremely Polite And Helpful. Namely The Barman On Our First Night (17Th)  The Waiter In The Restaurant (Breakfast Time)  The Hotel Manager And The Gentleman That Took Us To The Train Station.,,,,,
,35,Warm  Friendly And Relaxing,,,,,
,36,Staff Were Fantasic  Particularly Reception And Our Lovely Waitress ,,,,,
,37,Miscommunication Regarding Booking Of Spa Appointments. Room Ok. Otherwise Food Very Good.,,,,,
,38,Excellent!,,,,,
,39,Very Average Unfortunately. Generally Good Service (Except In The Bar Where We Had To Go To The Bar Twice To Order Our Own Drinks - No-One Came To Our Table And You Were Not Busy). Room However Tragically Tired Despite The Update  And General Hotel Décor Poor. Spa Sort Of Fine But Actually Lots Of The Rooms Don't Really Work  E.G. The Sauna Where There Is No Water To Add To The Burner To Create Heat? First One I've Ever Been In That Doesn't Have That. Thai Dinner Nice Enough But Zero Ambience. ,,,,,
,41,Very Brief This Time  But Sooo Relaxing And Luxurious.  Staff Are Friendly  Courteous And Professional At All Times.,,,,,
,42,Good Break  Only Disappointment Was The Manor Restaurant  Food Was Good But The Atmosphere Was Very Poor  It Would Be Nice If It Was A Restaurant And Not A Corner Of A Function Room. Maybe Look At Moving The Restaurant Into The Lounge Room Next To The Bar (The Room With All The Sofas And Nobody In It!)  With A Lovely Roaring Fire.  The Spa Was Lovely  Only Recommendation Would Be To Have More Lockers In The Ladies  Where I Arrived At The Spa On Day One At 11Am  I Couldn't Put My Clothes In A Locker  Reception Had To Put My Bag In A Cupboard Under The Stairs! ,,,,,
,43,A Really Enjoyable Stay  Where Every Need Was Anticipated And Provided For. Every Member Of Hotel Staff Encountered Was Courteous And Helpful  Including Restaurant Staff Who Were Attentive Without Being Intrusive. The Facilities In The Spa Were Outstanding As Was The Cleanliness.  A Return Is Already Being Planned! ,,,,,
,46,Very Relaxing With Excellent Spa Facilities.,,,,,
,47,It Was A Really Nice  Relaxing And Fun Weekend. ,,,,,
,48,Amazing! ,,,,,
,49,It Was Exactly As We Hoped And Expected  Very Relaxing!,,,,,
,51,Very Enjoyable. Attentive And Pleasant Staff At All Levels. ,,,,,
,52,Spa Facilities = Excellent  Rooms And Corridors Quite Noisy  Was Woken Up Often Late At Night  Kettle In Room Was Full Of Lime Scale So Could Not Be Used. ,,,,,
,53,Poor,,,,,
,54,Superb Facilities Very Friendly Helpful Staff  Lovely Food And A Very Comfortable Bedroom. ,,,,,
,55,Very Pleasant Stay In A Relaxed Environment. ,,,,,
,58,My Girlfriend & I Both Found The Hotel Very Relaxing  Nothing Seemed Too Much Trouble  The Food Was Excellent In Both The Thai & Main Restaurants  The Spa Was Exceptional. All The Staff Were Polite & Helpful & Made Us Feel Welcome.,,,,,
,59,As Always A Truly Wonderful And Relaxing Break,,,,,
,60,Thoroughly Enjoyable And Not Long Enough  Courteous Staff And Fantastic Customer Service.,,,,,
,61,Reception Room Was Very Nice  Dinner Experience Very Average  Breakfast V Good  Service  Was  Better  At  Breakfast Spa V Good  Decor In Restaurant Very Out Of Date More Like A Banqueting Suit And Breakfast Area  Used  For  Dinner Corridors In New Part Of Building Tired And Out  Of Date,,,,,
,62,We Had A Lovely Overnight Spa Break And Thoroughly Enjoyed The Spa. Everywhere Was Clean And Spa Area Was Well Maintained. Little Touches (Head Waiter In French Restaurant Knowing It Was My Birthday  Fruit And Balloon In Room) Was Well Appreciated. Felt There Was A Bit Of A Mismatch Between Atmosphere In Spa/Hotel. Bar Was Uncomfortably Quiet- Despite Having 5/6 Groups/Pairs Of Guests. Spa Felt Much More Welcoming.,,,,,
,63,Enjoyable,,,,,
,66,Fantastic; Continual Service Excellence,,,,,
,67,Very Good Stay :-) As Always,,,,,
,68,The Whole Weekend At The Hotel Was Amazing. Everybody Was Very Friendly And All The Staff Were Very Helpful. We Ate In The Thai Restaurant And Also The Main Hotel Restaurant  Both Were Brilliant! The Room We Stayed In Was Divine And We Would Recommend The Hotel To Anyone We Know.,,,,,
,69,Comfortable  Friendly - Overall Memorable And Happy Experience.,,,,,
,70,We Enjoyed Our Stay At Carey's Manor- The Spa Really Was Spectacular. However We Felt The Other Areas Of The Hotel Were Not Entirely In Keeping With The Tone And Atmosphere Of The Spa. Cleanliness Was Very Good And All Staff Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,71,Awesome  Amazing  Everything Was Truly Exceptional  Dinner  Spa  Breakfast  Room  Love  Love  A Love  Brilliant Value For Amoney To.,,,,,
,72,Over Busy. Very Loud. Friendly Staff. Excellent Food. ,,,,,
,73,Customer Service Is Exemplary -From The Cleaners To Senior Managers  The Care Of The Customer Is Paramount. When This Is Added To Gorgeous Food  Amazing Spa Facilities  The Best Beds Ever And An Affordable Price  It Becomes The Only Place To Go For A Pamper. The Only Downside Is Saying Goodbye.,,,,,
,74,Good For The Soul!,,,,,
,75,Amazing,,,,,
,77,The Hotel & Spa Overall Was Wonderful And We Had An Enjoyable Stay. However  There Was A Few Items That Didn't Make The Total Experience Excellent. There Was A Few Opportunities For Staff Members To Surprise And Delight And Raise The Bar Of The Service They Delivered. Unfortunately They Didn't Take These Opportunities To Really Provide A Wow Level Of Service. In Addition We Booked Two Rooms And Paid Extra For The Four Poster Rooms. We Were A Little Disappointed With The Size And Quality Of The Bathroom. It Unfortunately Was A Little Small. The Second Room Had Maintenance Issues With Heating And The Shower Breaking. In Addition The Room Was Small Compared With The Other One We Booked. ,,,,,
,78,Wonderful Spa And Treatments And Food In All Restuarants. Service In Zen Garden Much Improved. Only Annoyance Is At How Difficult It Is To Split Bills Between Guests On Checkout As Itimisation Is Opaque  Hard Tofathom And Many Items Booked To Wrong Room Or Not Split Between Rooms As Requested. A Personal  Rather That Room  Tab System Would Be Highly Desirable.,,,,,
,79,I Have Sent An Email To The Switchboard With Regard To This. Our Stay Was Wonderful Spoiled Only By The Yet Again Very Frustrating Check Out Where Our Bills Were All Inaccurate.,,,,,
,80,Relaxing Weekend Away With Friends,,,,,
,81,Lovely Hotel And Fantastic Spa. Staff  Friendly And Courteous  Very Good Customer Service. ,,,,,
,82,We Enjoyed Our Stay Very Much At Carey's. ,,,,,
,83,Enjoyable. Very Glad To Have Been Staying In The Old House As The Modern Rooms Did Not Look Very Appealing. Drinks Expensive In The Manor  And Much Cheaper At The French Restaurant. Swimming Pool Was Nice But Steam Room And Sauna Not So Good; I Don't Think That The Sauna Was Working And It Was Very Small. Breakfast Was Fine But The Menu Was Not Explained. French Restaurant Food And Service Very Good.,,,,,
,84,The Spa Experience Was Great  Staff And Facilities Were Just What We Were Hoping For And Weren't Disappointed At All. We Had A Lovely Lunch In The Zen Restaurant And Again A Good Evening Meal In Le Blaireau.  We Were A Little Disappointed With The Hotel Room.  Thought It Was Just Satisfactory And Not As Special As I Was Hoping For As It Was A Treat For My Wife's 40Th.  It Was Clean But Felt I Could Have Been In Any Bog Standard Hotel Room Which Wouldn't Have Cost As Much As I Paid.,,,,,
,88,We Had A Nice Time. Staff Were All Very Helpful. Food And Service Was Excellent In All Three Restaurants. ,,,,,
,90,Lovely Room  Not Enough Time Spent... May Be Do 2 Nights Next Time. However Was Less Impressed By Brasserie Than Expected To Be,,,,,
,92,Excellent As Always  However Was Very Disappointed That The Cooked Breakfast Was No Longer 'Buffet Style' - During Previous Visits The Breakfast Had Been One Of The Highlights Of Our Stays. Didn't Feel As If We Properly Fill Ourselves Up. On The Opposite End Of The Scale - I Would Like To Mention That The Kitchen Staff During Our Dinner Reservation Produced Some Of The Finest Food Myself  Or My Partner Have Ever Eaten  Especially The Pork-Belly Starter. Room Was Clean And Well Stocked  And The Staff Were Professional And Polite - As They Have Been Every Time We Have Visited.,,,,,
,93,Overall The Experience Was Good - The Hotel And Spa Staff Were Extremely Polite And Helpful.  The Facilities Were Great And We Really Enjoyed Our Stay. The Only Glitch Was That When We Had Lunch In The Zen Restaurant We Asked Which Drinks Were Included (For Free) With Our Spa Stay And The Waitress Told Us That Coffee  Orange Juice And Apple Juice Were Included So We Ordered And Orange Juice And A Latte.  When We Were Presented With The Bill The Latte And Orange Juice Were On The Bill So We Queried This - The Waitress Told Us That It Was Only Filter Coffee And Concentrated Juice That Was Included.  After I Had Explained That This Was Not What We Were Told The Waitress Said She Couldn't Take It Off The Bill.  It Was Only After I Protested And Explained That I Did Not Feel This Was Very Fair - Had We Have Been Told That In The First Place We Would Have Ordered Drinks To Fit In With The Deal.  Eventually (But Reluctantly) She Removed It From The Bill  But When We Came To Pay Off Our Bill For The Room The Next Day It Was Still On There! The Hotel Receptionist Politely Removed It Without Question When We Explained What Had Happened. After We Had Questioned The Bill In The Restaurant  The Waitresses Were All Stood Behind The Bar Whispering And Looking Over At Us Which I Did Not Feel Was Very Professional And To Be Honest Made Us Feel Very Uncomfortable.  I Felt That Considering We Had Spent A Fair Few Hundred Pounds To Stay For 2 Days  In The Scheme Of Things The Fuss Over Having The £10 Approx. Removed From Our Bill Was Not Worth Us Having An Uncomfortable Feeling With The Staff For The Rest Of The Day. Especially As When I Walked Into The Spa Reception One Of The Restaurant Staff Was There And Said To One Of The Other Staff "That's Her!" Overall We Really Enjoyed Our Stay But Perhaps The Staff Could Be Trained A Little Better On Customer Service When A Query Arises So That This Does Not Happen For Your Future Guests.,,,,,
,95,A Perfect Break From The Stress Of Day To Day Life  With Wonderful Staff Who Really Care That You Have A Great Stay,,,,,
,96,Excellent Food  Excellent Service.  All The Staff Are Attentive And Friendly,,,,,
,97,Great Food  Great Staff  Great Location,,,,,
,98,We Had A Nice Time  But For Someone With A Disability (Parkinsons) The Senspa Has A Lot Of Up And Down Steps And The Layout Is Quite Confusing  Even After Our Third Visit.   The Fine Dining Experience Was Very Good.,,,,,
,99,It Was My Second Visit To The Spa And Without Question The Best Spa Iv Been To (And Iv Been To Lots) I Wouldn't Normally Do These Surveys  I Just Delete But I Need To Praise Your Amazing Staff. Every Single Member Of Staff We Came Across Was  More Than Helpful/Friendly And Professional. It Was Noted On More Than One Occasion  That Everyone Would Go Well Out Of Thier Way To Fulfil Our Requests. Fab Experience Will Definitely Recommend And Hope To Be Back Soon.,,,,,
,103,Very Comfortable Oakwood Room. Staff Very Good. Different Areas Of Hotel Felt A Bit Disparate. Would Have Preferred Cost Of Hydro Spa To Be Added In To Overall Cost And Unlimited Access. ,,,,,
,104,Very Enjoyable Time And My Wife Was So Pleased With Her Massage She Would Like To Return,,,,,
,105,Service And Food Very Good However  We Thought The Hotel Was Looking A Little Tired And The Restaurant Lacked Atmosphere As Well As Lacking Attention To Detail Ie The Lampshades Over The Wall Lights Were At All Angles.,,,,,
,106,Overall Excellent  The Staff Were Extremely Professional  Polite  Attentive And Helpful. The Food At The Sen Garden Restaurant Was Exquisite  Quite Possibly The Best Food I Have Ever Had In Any Of The Hotels/Restaurants I've Eaten At. The Only Fly In The Ointment Was That The Noise From The Christmas Party Which Was Taking Place On The Evening We Stayed Over Was Too Excessive.  We Were Advised Before Booking And Again At Checking And We Generally Accepted That The Noise Levels Would Be High.  This Was Within Reason For Most Of The Night And We Even Managed To Get Off To Sleep Even Though Our Room Was Directly Above The Function Hall Where It Was Taking Place.  This Was Until Approximately 2Am When A Full On  Top Of Their Lungs Performance Of The Pogues' "Fairytale Of New York" Rendition Broke Out In The Main Lobby From What Seemed To Be A Male Choir (I Use The Term Loosely) Of Ten Of So Drunken Party Goers Which Woke Me Up In Such A Violently Sudden Manner. After The Third Attempt At Clearing Their Way Through This Most Classic Of All Modern Christmas Pop Songs It Would Seem That Someone From The Staff Might Have Stepped In To Deny Them Of Another Encore.  My Question Is  Why Did It Take So Long Given That They Knew That Guests Were Sleeping Only Metres Away?!? On A Positive Note  Lack Of Any Consistent Tone And Taking Into Account That It Sounded More Like A Football Match Was Kicking Off At 2Am.... .....They Weren't That Bad! Our Weekend Uplifted By The Staff And Array Of Facilities On Offer  However I Would Say That More Attention Needed To Be Given To The Condition Of The Pool Area Ceiling As It Looked Like It Was About To Cave In Which Made Us Very Nervous Walking Around That Area Near The Entrance To The Pool. The Lights In Several Areas Were Out Which Whilst Making For A Better More Moody Ambience Meant That My Partner Kept Stubbing Her Toes Due To Poorly Lit Areas. That Aside  We Are Giving Serious Consideration To A Membership To The Spa Or At The Very Least Making Provision To Visit As Often As We Can Each Year.,,,,,
,107,A Very Pleasant Overnight Stay .The Rooms Provide All  That We Needed ,,,,,
,108,Very Relaxing And Enjoyable ,,,,,
,109,Very Disappointed Compared To Previous Visit Last Time We Enjoyed Full Use Of All Facilities Including Hydro Spa This Time We Were Charged An Additional £120 Although When Booking I Was Advised That It Was The Same Deal This Rather Spoilt What Was Otherwise An Excellent Break I Can't Help Feel However That This Was Very Underhand Indeed,,,,,
,110,Relaxing Break  Excellent Food In Zen Garden Restaurant  Friendly Staff,,,,,
,111,A Very Relaxing And Enjoyable Two Days. The Staff Were Very Welcoming  Friendly  Efficient  And Couldn't Have Been More Helpful.The Standard Of Food And Service In The Restaurants Was Also Excellent. I Also Left Behind A Battery  Charger In My Room And Was E-Mailed By Reception To Advise It Was In Their Safe Keeping. Another Plus For Excellent Srvice.,,,,,
,112,A Very Relaxing And Comfortable Environment With First Class Services And Customer Care,,,,,
,113,The Hotel   Facilities And Staff Are Excellent The Only Issue On Both Visits Is The Hap-Hazard Billing  ! - Nothing Tallies Up  !,,,,,
,114,Spa Facilities Very Good But Didn't Know About The 2 Levels For Experience Rooms. Mum Is 75 And I Was Aware That The Stairs Restricted Her Freedom To Move Between Rooms Without Me There To Ensure Her Safety In The Dimly Lit Area. The Bistro Meal Was Very Good And Service Excellent. Main Reason For Lower Rating Was Noise Between 2 And 3 Am In The Corridor -We Were Warned That There Was An Event On In The Hotel But We Didn't Expect Shouting And Door Banging At That Time Of The Morning. After A Relaxing Spa And Meal It Was A Shame To Be Exhausted The Next Day After Broken Sleep.,,,,,
,115,Very Welcoming  With A High Standard Of Service From Friendly Staff. Had Two Excellent Dinners In The Manor Restaurant.,,,,,
,116,Good Staff  Upgraded (Refurb) Rooms Much More Aligned To Price That Older Non Updated Rooms Which Are Poor.,,,,,
,117,Lovely. Surprised My Boyfriend For His Birthday  I Loved The Little Touches With The Welcome Prosecco On Arrival And Note To Say Happy Birthday. ,,,,,
,118,We Had An Amazing Time  And Will Be Looking To Host Our Wedding There. Anya Helped With Our Booking And Was Brilliant. Very Kindly Offered An Upgrade And A Balloon And Card Was Left In Our Room Which Was A Lovely Gesture. Thanks To Her And Everyone Else At The Hotel We Will Defiantly Be Staying Again And Recommending To Friends And Family. ,,,,,
,119,Simple Pleasure. Well Looked After And A Very Unassuming Hotel With All Your Needs Met. Perfect!,,,,,
,120,Our Stay Was Spoilt As We Were Not Aware That The Bistro Would Be Closed On The Thursday Evening Andfriday Evening And The Other Restaurant Closed Also On The Friday Due To Christmas Parties The Staff Were Very Helpful Serving Our Meal In Our Room But It Would Have Been Better If We Had Known Before We Booked As We Were Flexible On Time For Our Visiit Which Is To See Relations In Brockenhurst Wethank You For The Good Meal And Wine In Our Room   ,,,,,
,121,We Rarely Get To Go Away Without The Children So For Us A Sneaky Night Away With Access To The Spa Is A Luxurious Treat. Immediately From Booking The Required Package To All The  Hotel And Spa Staff We Met Were Polite  Efficient  And Professional. Nothing Felt Too Much Trouble. The Zen Garden Was As Delicious As Ever And Staff So Attentive. The Bottle Of Bubbly And Chocolates In Our Room As A Welcome Back Gift Was A Very Thoughtful Touch And Very Much Appreciated. We Always Like The Rooms 18 19.20 And You Have Always Accommodated This  Which Adds To Our Feeling Of Relaxation. We Will Be Back As Soon As We Can Save Up Again. Thank You Nicola Heckstall Smith And Mr Griffiths.,,,,,
,122,We Were Very Disappointed That The Bistro Was Closed To Us On Thursday And Friday Evenings And The Main Restauranton Friday Due To Christmas Parties The Staff Were Very Helpful And Kind Giving Us A Meal In Our Room The Wine And Food Were Excellant But We Would Not Have Booked Those Dates If We Had Known As We Were Flexible On Dates We Always Stay At The Hotel When We Visit Friends In Brockenhurst,,,,,
,123,The Room Was Fine  As Was Check In And Breakfast  But The Whole Experience Was Ruined By Noisy Christmas Party Revellers Who Kept Us Awake Until Very Late. As A Result We Managed Only 4 Hrs Sleep Which Ruined An Otherwise Pleasant Stay. Given That There Appeared To Be Two Main Parties On The Evening We Stayed It Would Possibly Have Been A Good Idea If Management Had Anticipated People Making A Noise In Their Rooms Until The Early Hours And Checked. ,,,,,
,124,As We Were Coming For A Friends Party We Had To Bring Our 11M Old Son And Were Surprised How Non Child Friendly The Hotel Was. Its Was Disappointing That We Couldn't Even Use The Pool.  The Breakfast Was Also Disappointing   It Took A Long Time  Service Was Lacking (We Felt Forgotten) And Wasnt As Nice As We Expected.  We Also Felt We Had To Keep Our Son As Quiet As Possible So Not To Disturb Others.   The Major Issue We Had Was Human Hair Still In The Bath. I Did Mention This At Checkout And The Duty Manager Did Refund Us £50 Which Was A Big Surprise.   The Hotel Is Beautiful But We Felt Trapped In Our Room As We Couldn't Use Any Of The Facilities Or Restaurants With Our Son. We Understand You Are Not A Family Friendly Hotel But Even The Staff Seemed A Little Off With Our Son Being With Us.,,,,,
,126,Very Pleasant And Relaxing ,,,,,
,127,Dawn Took My Booking  Gave Some Great Advice & Helped Me Through The 'Many Options' Available. Mentioned I Was Looking For 24 Hrs Of Relaxation & Was Given A Package Which Was Perfect For Just Myself. Had A Fantastic Room (19). ,,,,,
,128,We Had A Really Relaxing Time And The Food In The Zen Garden Restaurant Was Very Good And Reasonably Priced.,,,,,
,129,Very Nice  Food Was Good. Very Clean.,,,,,
,130,Not Long Enough! We Did The Christmas Deal Which Was A Huge Incentive As We Have Spent So Much On Our House Recently. ,,,,,
,132,Excellent As Always  Friendly Helpful Staff. Clean Rooms. All Staff Make You Feel Special And Add To The Experience   Which For Us Was Relaxing  Exciting To Be Back  Always Made Very Welcome. I Have Visited With My Husband   Mother And Friends And The Experience As Been First Class On All Occasions .,,,,,
,133,Relaxing And Peaceful With Excellent Food,,,,,
,134,Very Enjoyable And Relaxing. Overall Thought Our Break Was Reasonably Good Value For Money. Staff Friendly. ,,,,,
,135,Brilliant!,,,,,
,138,We Had An Absolutely Fantastic Christmas Break.  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble  Every Member Of Staff We Met During The Stay Met Or Exceeded Our Expectations We Would Highly Recommend Careys Manor And Especially For A Special Experience At Christmas. ,,,,,
,139,Relaxing & Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,140,Thoroughly Relaxing And Enjoyable. The Staff Were All Brilliant Thank You,,,,,
,141,Very Good,,,,,
,142,Lovely Setting  Great Service,,,,,
,143,Friendly And Relaxed,,,,,
,144,Excellent,,,,,
,146,You Need To Ask Guests Whether They Wish To Be Constantly Bothered Or Not. I Did Not Appreciate Constantly Being Asked Whether I Wanted Someone To Park My Car  Carry Bags  Open My Room Door  Turn Down Beds  Phoned To Ask Whether Everything Was Ok  Whether I Wanted Someone To Get M Car. Some Guests Might Find These Services Useful  I Found It Quite Tedious. ,,,,,
,147,One Of The Most Friendly And Welcoming Hotels We Have Ever Stayed In . The Staff Were So Helpful And Happy Throughout Our Stay. Your Attention To Detail For The Festive Period Was Very Special And Made Our Christmas.The Standard Of Food Was Outstanding .Our Room Was Very Comfortable . The Spa Was A Great Place To Relax.We Will Most Certainly Be Back. ,,,,,
,148,Very Personal And Luxurious Experience,,,,,
,149,A Wonderful Experience With Fabulous Food And Service,,,,,
,150,Very Relaxing And Staff Friendly,,,,,
,151,Very Nice Stay,,,,,
,152,Delightful!    Your Team Are Brilliant - Just The Right Tone - The Perfect Amount Of Attention  Leaving Us To Enjoy Ourselves.  I Should Like To Commend Nora  On Reception  And Ruben  Who Seemed To Be Instantly On Hand Every Time We Needed Something  They Are A Great Credit To You.    Thank You So Much For The Bottle Of Champagne And The Chocolates  I Was Not Looking Forward To Being 50  But Staying At Careys Manor Was The Perfect Treat To Compensate.  ,,,,,
,153,Bliss!,,,,,
,154,It Was A Wonderful Christmas (Our First Away From The Family So Booked With Some Trepidation). The Welcome  The Service  The Facilities  The Accommodation And The Food And Wine Were All Absolutely First Class. In Particular The Politness And Thoughfulness Of All The Staff Made Everything Very Special. ,,,,,
,155,Wonderful!  I Can't Fault It.  The Staff Can't Do Enough To Ensure My Stay Is Perfect.,,,,,
,156,Wonderful.  The Staff Can't Do Enough To Ensure Everything Is Perfect.  ,,,,,
,157,We Had A Very Enjoyable Experience The Only Negative Remark I Would Have Is Maybe That A Bit Of Background Music Would Be Nice In The Zen Garden Restaurant.,,,,,
,158,Always Relaxing With Efficient Staff And First Class Service,,,,,
,159,The Christmas Break Was Wonderful  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Anyone.   Tweaks Hear And There Would Be Good  But Overall It Was Outstanding.  Our Second Year Of Spending Christmas With Careys Manor And It Won't Be Our Last.,,,,,
,160,Good Spa  Excellent Customer Service  Brilliant Breakfast,,,,,
,161,From The Moment We Arrived To Mulled Wine And A Cheerful Reception Staff Until We've Booked Out On Friday We Had A Truly Wonderful Time. Thank You Very Much.,,,,,
,163,Very Relaxing. Combination Of Restaurants And Swimming Pool Appreciated. We Are Not Spa Users. Excellent Room And Bedding Etc. Good Walking And We Like Brockenhurst  Even In Winter.,,,,,
,164,We Found The Staff Very Attentive (Especially Terry In The Bar). Also The Restaurant Staff Very Also Very Good. My Only Criticism Is That I Would Have Liked A Fridge In Our Room  But Now I Know To Ask.  Also  Eating In The Other 2 Restaurants Was Very Confusing  To Them And To Us.  Even Though I Told Them We Were With The Hotel Package  They Still Charged Us For The Meals.  This Was Quickly Rectified On Check Out. We Will Definitely Come And Stay Again  Even Next Christmas.  Thank You  Geraldine & Kevin Tilley,,,,,
,165,Overall  An Excellent Experience.  However  The Service In The Manor Restaurant Slows As The Restaurant Fills And This Has Been Noted During One Than One Stay.,,,,,
,166,Excellent Throughout,,,,,
,168,Unfortunately Unable To Our Full 4 Day Xmas Break But Appreciate That You Agreed To Replacing The First Two Nights Which We Lost By Staying With You For An Extra Night On 27Th.,,,,,
,169,You Are On The Up    We Sense That You Are Working Hard And Keeping A Good Standard ,,,,,
,170,A Very Relaxing Break With Excellent Service,,,,,
,171,Stayed Previously In A Knightwood Room Which Was More Up To Date And Modern Than This This Time. See Following Comments Re Dining.,,,,,
,173,A Very Special Experience. All Aspects Of Ther Hotel Are Well Presented And The Staff Are Wonderful.,,,,,
,174,Wonderful Staff  Well Presented Accomodations,,,,,
,175,Fabulous,,,,,
,176,Overall Just What We Needed. .. Great Food   Lovely Treatments ..A Place To Relax And Be Spoilt,,,,,
,179,Very Accommodating Staff  From The Moment We Arrived And Throughout Our Stay,,,,,
,180,Our Christmas Stay Was Perfect And The Staff Made The Occasion With There Cheerful Approach To The Festive Season,,,,,
,181,I Have Always Been Happy To Come To Careys Manor. Unfortunately I Was Not Happy With Room 12  The Bedside Cabinet Was Dusty  The Curtain Was Falling Down And The Shower Went Hot And Cold With Very Low Pressure. Food Always Good And Staff Always Helpful. ,,,,,
,183,Was Wonderfully Relaxing. Having Never Been Before  I Would Definitely Come Again! We Had One Small Issue With Our Room - The Long Filament Bulb Above The Wardrobe Being Broken - And 10 Minutes After Reporting It To Reception We Were Offered A Free Room Upgrade To The Manor Suite  Which Was Fantastic. What Good Customer Service.,,,,,
,184,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,185,Excellent. Weather Was Foul  But Kindness And Consideration Of Your Staff Was Excellent  Especially Your Barman [The Man With The Slight Speech Impediment] And The Polish Gentleman Who Ran Me To The Train Station When It Was Hosing Down With Rain,,,,,
,186,We Booked For The New Years Eve Package And A Day In The Spa On The First. The Whole Event Was Magical  The Champagne Gorgeous  The Food Wonderful And The Entertainment Exactly Finished Off What Was A Brilliant Evening.  The Next Day We Spent Being Pampered (Sen Fusion Massage) Which My Husband Says Wasn't Long Enough! We Came Away Refreshed And Renewed Ready For The Oncoming Year.  We Will Be Back As Soon As Possible.  A Million Thanks.....,,,,,
,187,My Party And I All Found The Hotel Excellent.  We Thought The New Year's Party Evening Was The Best Ny Party Night We Had Been To  And We Have Been To A Few Over The Years.  The Staff Were Extremely Helpful And Very Polite.  Our Only Criticism Was Our Disappointment With The Spa And The Additional Charge To Enter The Main Areas.  Especially Not Being Able To Go In The Quiet Room To Relax Even Though We Were Spending Money On Treatments.  This Is Not Something We Have Encountered Elsewhere And Felt That Residents Should Have Full Run Of The Spa In Order To Obtain Maximum Enjoyment Without Additional Cost  This Area Would Put Us Off Coming Back For A Spa Weekend Which Is Something The Ladies In Our Group And Myself Often Do During The Year.  Also Not Clear Information Given In The Spa On How Things Work And Where You Can Get Refreshments Etc.  ,,,,,
,188,Excellent For The Price.,,,,,
,189,Wonderful! A Consistently High Level Of Excellent Customer Service From All Members Of Staff. Peter  Especially  Was Fantastic; Nothing Was Too Much Trouble And He Allowed Us To Relax And Register At The Spa While He Sorted Out Our Car And Took Our Bags To Our Room. We Loved The Ambiance Of The Hotel And The Facilities Of The Spa Were Superb. The Treatment (We Each Had A Zen Fusion Massage) Was Wonderful. The Food Was Excellent At Both Lunch And Dinner (We Ate In The Thai Restaurant Each Time) I Can't Praise The Whole Team Enough. ,,,,,
,190,Great!,,,,,
,191,Very Attentive And Friendly Staff  Excellent Meals  Especially The Wonderful Seafood Buffet For New Years Eve  The Gaming Tables Were A Brilliant Idea And A Diversion If You Wished To Have A Break From The Disco!  Room Was Excellent - Will Come Again Next Year If We Can.,,,,,
,192,Expensive For Quality And Experience. Have Stayed In Cheaper Hotels With More To Offer. Felt Excluded With The Two Tier System Used In The Spa Area  Have Never Experienced This At Other Spa Hotels.,,,,,
,193,Most Impressed With The  Response From The Reservations Team Namely Michael And Dawn Whom I Dealt With. Very Helpful And Both Did Their Best To Assist And Follow Up. The Service Level In The Restaurant Was Probably The Best  I Have Experienced From All Our Previous Stays Which Was Complimented With A High Standard Of Cuisine. Staff Throughout The Hotel Were  Helpful And  Courteous With The Front Desk Being Very Responsive . All Of Our Party Were Impressed With The Hotel And Staff Without Exception. It Says A Lot About The Management As All Success Starts At The Top! We All Were Very Pleased To Be Part Of The Party!,,,,,
,194,Mixed. The Hotel Itself Is Lovely And Most Of The Staff Were Extremely Helpful But The Night Porter Who Checked Us In Took Ages To Find Our Booking  Misplaced Our Bags And Didn't Give Us Any Info About Breakfast Etc The Next Day. Subsequently We Missed Breakfast And Went Home Hungry And Unimpressed. ,,,,,
,195,Thoroughly Enjoyed All Aspects.,,,,,
,196,Fantastic  The Perfect Place To Relax And Unwind.,,,,,
,198,Very Friendly And Accommodating Staff For Me Was Paramount. The Accommodation  Food And Spa Were Top Rate.,,,,,
,199,Very Relaxing. Staff All Helpful And Polite. Our Room Was Clean And Well Serviced.,,,,,
,200,Overall We Enjoyed Our Stay. We Had An Issue With A Faulty Kettle And Entry Into Our Room Of Room Service Staff In The Late Evening When We Had Not Requested Anything But Loved The Manor Restaurant And The Spa Facilities ,,,,,
,201,First Class   ,,,,,
,202,Very Friendly Staff And A Stunning Hotel. Very Warm And Cosy Inside. Fantastic Breakfast Too.,,,,,
,203,A Very Good Welcome From The Concierge Luis And Receptionist On Duty.A Very Nice Start ! Then The Place And The Hotel Is Really Nice.The Room Superb (We Had Room 15 And Except For A Strange Noise Often Eared Probably Same Air Condition Motor Or Samething Else From Above The Ceiling  But Comparing To Overall Was Not A Big Problem For Us). Beautifull Spa Facilities And Swimming Pool Area. A Nice Breakfast With A Very Good Service. Congratulations,,,,,
,204,From The Moment We Arrived We Felt Very Well Looked After By Your Excellent Staff. Our Room Was Very Comfortable And Quiet And Dinner New Year's Eve Was Wonderful ,,,,,
,206,We Felt Well Looked After By All The Staff And Loved The Accommodation And Food.,,,,,
,207,Really Enjoyed Our Stay At The Hotel.Such Friendly Staff And Lovely Atmosphere. The Room Was Very Comfortable With All Amenities And Very Clean. The Spa Was One Of The Best Wonderful Facilities And Friendly Therapists. Thought The New Years Eve Party Celebrations Were Great.The Food Excellent And A Sea Food Buffet To Die For! The Effort All The Hotel Staff Put In To Make A Memorable Night Was Amazing.      ,,,,,
,208,Very Good Service  Friendly Staff  Excellent Food. Regarding The New Year Eve Event  Only Criticism Was The Dance Floor Was Too Small And People Should Not Take Drinks On The Dance Floor.,,,,,
,209,Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,210,Relaxing Stay With Pleasant Atmosphere,,,,,
,211,The  New Year Event Was Excellent,,,,,
,212,Very Calm And Relaxing In Lovely Environment,,,,,
,213,Very Enjoyable And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For The Staff Who Were  Courteous And Cheerful.,,,,,
,214,Highly Disappointing.  The Service For Breakfast Was Appalling On The First Day.  The Coffee Tasted Like Dishwater.  The Evening Meal In The Manor Restaurant Tasted Good But The Size Of The Portions  Particularly The Vegetarian  Were Taking The Mickey.  We Went Back To Our Room And Ate Cheese And Biscuits.  The Thai Restaurant Was Good But The Toilet Facilities (Near The Thai) Were Equivalent To A 2 Star Hotel.  The Corridors Were Sad And Worn.  The Suitcase Stand In The Bedroom Was Unusable Because It Was Directly Beneath The Tv So You Couldn't Open The Lid Of The Case.  The Sound Of The Fan In Another Adjoining Bathroom You Could Hear Off And On During The Night.,,,,,
,215,I Have Used The Spa Annually For Five Years Now And Also Given Gift Vouchers To Friends And Family To Use The Facility.  However  I Was Disappointed With The Service During A Recent Visit And No Not View The Spa With The Same Regard As I Have In The Past And Will Be Trying Another Spa Next Time.   The Members Of Staff Were Generally Unhelpful And I Felt That I Was An Inconvenience Rather Than A Valued Customer. I Could List The Other Disappointing Moments But Feel Generally That It Was Nit Good Enough.   One Member Of Staff However  Carmen  Was Fantastic And Should Be Commended. ,,,,,
,216,Very Good  From Arrival Through To Departure,,,,,
,217,Relaxing And Quiet.  ,,,,,
,218,Great Food  Accommodation And Experience. Very Attentive Staff. ,,,,,
,219,The Hotel Was Very Nice And The Spa The Best Ive Been To And Ive Been To Spa's All Around The World.,,,,,
,221,Staff Very Friendly And Efficient. Good Quality Food. Excellent Organised N.Y's Gala Ball.,,,,,
,222,Very Enjoyable Break.,,,,,
,223,Restful,,,,,
,224,Beautiful,,,,,
,225,Excellent   Superb    ,,,,,
,226,Very Enjoyable Experience With Excellent Customer Empathy & Care,,,,,
,227,Enjoyable But Crowded This Time  We've Loved Coming In The Past But Felt A Bit Package Holiday This Weekend,,,,,
,228,This Was Our Second Stay And Just Like The First One We Were Very Pleased With The Service. This Year We Have Stayed In Much Smaller Room But The Deco And Big Bathroom Made It Feel Very Cozy And Comfortable. As For The Spa..Excellent! We Have Upgraded Our Spa Experience Allowing Us To Use All The Facilities. Overall:Great Location  Lovely Rooms  Friendly Service And Outstanding Spa! We Will Definitely Be Back!,,,,,
,229,Could Not Fault The Service.  A Most Enjoyable Stay.,,,,,
,230,Relaxing. High Service Ethic With Minimal Formality.,,,,,
,231,Brilliant Fun!,,,,,
,232,Third Or Fourth Visit. Expectations High And Met,,,,,
,233,One Of Best Hotel S Ever Stayed At.,,,,,
,234,Another Lovely Stay In One Of Your Manor Rooms. Very Relaxing  Great Service And Delicious Dining.  A Few Minor Suggestions But Nothing That Was A Problem:  The Shower In Our Room (15) Was Lacking Pressure. ,,,,,
,235,Very Well Organised  Both New Year Eve And New Year Day Dinners Were Excellent  Especially Considering Number Of Covers To Deal With. Excellent Staff On Arrival  During And Checking Out.,,,,,
,236,Everything As We Expected. Relaxing And Staff Very Attentive,,,,,
,237,Lovely Hotel And Excellent Staff  The Spa  And Pool Were Lovely.   The Staff Are Very Attentive.  My Only Recommendation It That The Gym Needs To Be Bigger And Have More Machines And Weights.  Otherwise I Really Enjoyed My Say!,,,,,
,238,Both The Level Of Service Provided By The Staff And The Food Were More Than Satisfactory And From This Perspective The Stay Was Lovely. The Interior Decor And Grounds Were Also Lovely. But For The Price Of The Room I Did Not Feel It Was Justified  The Double Bed Was Two Mismatched Singles Pushed Together  The Mattress Was Awful And I Awoke With A Stiff Back And Neck And Also The Duvet Was Exceptionally Thin; More Suited To A Warm August Night Than -1 In January. Staying Only One Night  We Did Not Stop By The Spa On This Occasion.,,,,,
,239,Perfect  There Is Not One Thing I Could Find To Fault My Experience  All The Staff Were Friendly And Couldnt Do Enough For You.  I Mentioned In Passing To Conceirge That It Was My Birthday Treat And Came Back After Using The Spa To A Balloon And Chocolates And A Note  It Was Lovely,,,,,
,240,Relaxing,,,,,
,241,Very Polite Staff. Lovely Pool And Jacuzzi. The Food Was Excellent And Special Mention To The Guy Who Showed Us To Our Rooms And To The Spa. Thanks!,,,,,
,242,The Staff Were Generally Cordial And Helpful.  It Wasn't As Quiet As I Would Have Liked As Some Of The Guests Were Rather Boisterous And Loud But There's Not Much You Could Do About That.  The Room Was Clean And The Food  Excellent. ,,,,,
,244,Relaxing And Enjoyable,,,,,
,245,Staff Were All Very Friendly And Extremely Helpful Both In The Hotel And Spa. They Were There When Needed  But Not Bothersome Or Over Eager When Their Services Were Not Required. Everywhere Was Clean  Well Kept And Well Presented. A Very Pleasant  Quiet Weekend. Exactly What We Hoped For.,,,,,
,246,The Spa And Gym Facilities Are Great.  The Rest Of The Hotel Could Really Do With A Lick Of Paint And Being Brought Up To Date To Match The Expectations That A Majority Of Hotel Goers Have.  The Spa Compared To The Rest Of The Hotel Seem To Be At Polar Opposites And If The Rest Of The Hotel Could Be Brought Up To The Same Standards As The Spa It Could Only Be A Win Win.  ,,,,,
,247,A Lovely Weekend With Friends.  Could Not Fault The Hotel.   Customer Service Top Notch.   Surprised By High Levels Of Staff And Breadth Of Nationalities,,,,,
,248,We Spent A Beautiful 4 Days At Cm And As Usual Thoroughly Enjoyed The Spa Treatments. We Only Had Dinner Once During Our Stay  As We Feel The Menu And Choice Of Food Could Be Improved Upon. We Did Not Use The Hydro Pool Facilities This Time (We Have During Our Past Visits) As We Feel That When We Paid £287/350 Per Night That It Should Be Included In The Price. Especially As It Was Out Of Season And The Hotel Was So Quiet.,,,,,
,249,We Were Delighted With Our Stay Over Christmas.  The Service Was Excellent And Much Appreciated,,,,,
,250,A Great Stay As Usual - Just A Couple Of Things I Would Change To Make It Better,,,,,
,251,From The Moment We Checked In We Were Shown Excellent Customer Service  From A Complimentary Room Upgrade To Celebrate Our Special Break To A Guided Tour Of The Hotel & Spa On Arrival. Excellent All Round! Thankyou. ,,,,,
,252,A Very Pleasant  Relaxing Break - Lovely Staff And Hotel. Not Quite As Luxurious As We'd Expected  But A Wonderful Break Nevertheless.,,,,,
,254,As Lovely As Always - Just A Couple Of Changes Would Have Made It An Excellent Stay,,,,,
,255,Very Relaxing And Comfortable. Friendly And Helpful Staff And Management.,,,,,
,256,Relaxing And Not Rushed  Just What We Wanted/Needed. No Complaints. Some Parts Of The Hotel Need A Bit Of A Spruce Up  But I Guess You Know That!,,,,,
,259,Lovely  However I Felt Standards Had Dropped From My Previous Stay Last Year.,,,,,
,260,Very Relaxing  Good Food  Friendly Staff.,,,,,
,261,Very Relaxing And Excellent Service,,,,,
,262,Fairly Good,,,,,
,263,We Feel Very Welcome By All The Staff And Have No Concerns About Repeat Visits.,,,,,
,264,Our Room Was Beautiful  Well Equipped And Very Comfortable. We Used The Pool In The Afternoon And It Was Very Busy  The Pool Was Quite Cold Which Didn't Entice You To Stay In It For Long. We Had An Issue With No Hot Water In Room In The Evening When We Were Getting Ready To Go Out Which Was A Shame.  The Gentleman At Reception Was Helpful And Gave Us Another Room Key And Sorted Thigs Out For Us.   We Found The Food At Dinner And Breakfast Was Really Good.,,,,,
,265,Refined But Relaxed.,,,,,
,266,All Staff Were Really Helpful And Friendly. But Overall It Is Too Expensive For The Overall Package ,,,,,
,267,Overall Great Break: Pros Great Location  Food In Thai Restaurant  Professional Staff  Nice Settings  Wonderful Massage ( From Lord) And Loved The Spa And Pool Area. Yoga Teacher And Session Was Great On Sunday Morning. Spa Staff Really Helpful Too.   Cons Had A 915Pm Booking In The Thai Restaurant And We Both Felt Like The Manger Is Particular Was Rushing Us So They Could Finish Thier Shift. They Literally Cleared Our Starter Which Came Out Almost Immediately  And Came Straight Back With Our Main Courses. Some Could Say This Was Efficient But We Got A General Vibe Of Feeling Rushed.   Spa Treatments - Vat Could Be More Upfront As The Treatments Were Already Fairly Expensive So This Felt A Bit Cheeky And Not Very Clear On The Spa Info.   Bespoke Massage Is Also Not Really Totally Bespoke As You Pick Off A List. Then My Boyfriend Asked For Slightly Firmer Pressure In His And Got Told That This Was A Thai Massage So If He Wanted Former Then He Needed To Pay For A 1 Hour Session.  He Also Asked For More Legs And Was Told She Only Had A 15 Min Programme - So He Asked Her To Do It Twice. So Not Truly Bespoke. I Also Asked For More Legs And Was Told Not Possible  But Not To Worry As My Legs Would Be Better Afterwards As All Connected. So I Guess It's In The Way You Say It.   If Being Picky Then Didn't Love The Scambled Egg A Think It's A Packet Mix That Hotels Use So Tastes Very Bland. This Was For Breakfast Obviously.  But Other Than The Above And They Did Not Spoil The Break - Everything Else Was Great. ,,,,,
,268,High Quality Accommodation With Excellent Service From Attentive  Helpful And Polite Staff. Food Was Of A High Standard With An Excellent Choice Of Cuisines. Spa Was Well Appointed And Provided An Enjoyable Relaxing Experience.,,,,,
,269,Enjoyable  But Far Too Expensive For What You Get.,,,,,
,270,A Good Hotel In A Beautiful  Quiet Setting With Excellent Spa And Restaurant Facilities.,,,,,
,271,Restful,,,,,
,272,We Had A Nice Room In The Main Manor  We Did Not Pay Extra For The Senspa And The Basic Facilities We Were Entitled To Use Were A Bit Disappointing. The Highlight Of The Stay Was The Evening Meal In The Manor Restaurant  Every Component Of The Food Was Beautiful  Compliments To The Head Chef. Breakfast Was However Nothing Special  I Stay In Hotels All Over The World And This Did Not Match The Standard Of Dinner.,,,,,
,274,Fabulous Break  Spa Was Stunning  Service From Staff Was Outstanding,,,,,
,277,Perfect Service And Comfort,,,,,
,279,Overall Great For Our Short Break,,,,,
,280,Excellent Experience.  We Got Married At Carey's Manor And Have Stayed Twice Since And Thoroughly Enjoy Ourselves Every Time.  Service Throughout Was Excellent From Booking  Desk Staff Checking In And Out  Spa And Room Service.  Also Food At The Zen Garden Was Excellent.,,,,,
,281,Very Nice Hotel Friendly Staff  Disappointed With Shower In Room Didn't Get Hot Water And No Pressure  View From Room Not Good View Of Roof And College As Our Honeymoon Would Of Liked A Better View. Food At French Restaurant And Thai Restaurant Was Wonderful.  Spa Facilities Were First Class. ,,,,,
,282,A Completely Relaxing Break  Everything We Needed Was There And The Staff Attention Was Top Rate Thoughtout The Hotel And The Spa. ,,,,,
,283,Welcoming  Relaxing  Excellent Food  Great Time In The Spa And Loved The Little Touches - The Welcome Note And Chocolates Were Really Appreciated.,,,,,
,284,First Class,,,,,
,285,Excellent Exactly What We Looked For In Our Stay At The Manor In All Areas,,,,,
,286,Perfect  Staff Were All Very Helpful  The Hotel Was Beautiful  Clean And Everything We Wanted. Spa Was Amazing Couldn't Have Been Better Thankyou,,,,,
,287,Everything I Hoped For - Absolutely No Criticisms At All. Thank You!,,,,,
,288,Fab,,,,,
,290,My Partner Enjoyed A Lovely Relaxing Birthday Treat And So Did I. We Have Been Stayed At Your Lovely Hotel 3 Times Now And We Look Forward To Visiting Again Soon. ,,,,,
,292,Convenient And Peaceful Location  Friendly Service  Pleasant Place.  Pleasant And Easy Going  Rather Than Luxurious.,,,,,
,301,Care And Attention From Staff Excellent As Ever.,,,,,
,302,Just Right . Poa 'S Facial And Massage Was Wonderful,,,,,
,303,It Was Very Enjoyable And I Will Return. There Were A Few Irritations - Beer In The Bar Was Warm Because The Fridge Is Not Cold Enough  We Arrived Saturday Afternoon But Couldn't Get A Massage (You Should Advise People To Book This In Advance - A Spa Week-End Without A Massage?!). Likewise With The Zen Restaurant - We Wanted To Go There Saturday Evening But It Was Fully Booked. Finally  Your Winter Warmer Package Is Worthless - Nice Restaurants But This Package Really Wasn't Worth It - Especially In The Zen. Thai Food Should Be A Mixture Of Small Dishes - Not 'Starter  Main & Dessert' As Identified Quite Forcefully By Your Waitress! Minor Issues But Could Be Improved In My Opinion. The Staff Were Excellent  The Spa Very Good And The Restaurants Excellent - Other Than That Mentioned. Thanks For A Good Week End. ,,,,,
,304,Very Nice Stay And Really Had An Enjoyable Week End. Price Was A Bit High Compared To Other Hotels In The Area ,,,,,
,307,Attentive And Knowledgeable Staff. Comfortable Rooms.,,,,,
,308,Lovely As Before - We Had A Mixed Experience With Treatments (Noted And Compensated By Hotel Manager). We Felt The Spa Was Rather Too Busy And Noisy On The Friday And The Blissed-Out Peace Of Thursday Was Much More Preferable. However Food  Room  Facilities  Staff All Fantastic And Thank You For The Complimentary Chocolates!! We Will Return..;)),,,,,
,309,Staff Attitude And Service Was First Class :-),,,,,
,310,The Spa Is Beautiful   Not Over Crowded  A Wonderful Place To Relax And Unwind. The Hotel Room Was Immaculately Clean And Very Comfortable. The Hotel Staff Are Very Welcoming And Approachable. The Manor Restaurant Serves Wonderful Food And The Service Is Exceptional. We Had A Very Enjoyable Stay And Will Definitely Return And Recommend To Our Friends.,,,,,
,312,Lovely ,,,,,
,313,Absolutely Amazing! The Handwritten Personalised Welcome  Birthday Note  Balloon And Chocolates Was So Touching And Much Appreciated. 
Staff Friendly And Courteous And Always Smiled. They Couldn't Do Enough And Appeared Genuinely Happy In Their Jobs Which Was Beautiful. 
Spa Facilities Fantastic. Checking In And Out Efficient! Room Brilliant. Could Not Have Been A Better Birthday Surprise And Will Definitely Be Back. Thank You So So Much! ,,,,,
,316,Very Relaxing  Attentive And Friendly Staff And Excellent Food + Service.,,,,,
,318,Excellent Food  Great Service And Spa Facilities.,,,,,
,319,A Lovely  Relaxing Break,,,,,
,320,Relaxing And Indulgent,,,,,
,321,A Lovely Relaxing Break  A Real Treat And The Staff Could Not Be More Helpful And Kind,,,,,
,322,Wonderful! ,,,,,
,324,The Hotel Was More 'Tired' Than Last Time. We Reserved A Table At 9Pm In The Zen Garden (Later Than We Wanted) And Then Felt Rushed To Make A Decision Before The Kitchen Was Due To Close At 9.30. Why Take Bookings Late If That Is Going To Be The Case. The Manager Interrupted Us Mid Conversation Several Times At The Beginning Of The Meal - The Rest Of The Staff Were Helpful But Cleaning The Tables Around Us Was Not Relaxing. The Breakfast Was Ok But I Was Not Impressed With The Quality Of The Sliced Bread Which Reminded Me Of The Toast I Used To Get At School. My Husband Waited In A Queue For 15 Mins And Still Did Not Get Any Poached Eggs... His Plate Was Taken Away While He Was Still Eating. I Thought The Theme Of The French Restaurant Where We Had Lunch On The Saturday Was Rather Over The Top But The Staff Were Helpful. ,,,,,
,326,We Have Stayed At Carey's Before (Our Wedding Night) And Visited For Spa Days Many Times Before. We Usually Dine At Lunch Time In The Thai Restaurant Which Is Excellent. This Time It Was My Wife's 30Th Birthday And I Wanted Something Special So We Had Dinner In The Manor Restaurant. For 3 Courses And A Drink Each We Spent Around £115. We Eat Out In Gourmet/ Fine-Dining Restaurants At Least One Every Few Months So We Had High Expectations. The Presentation Was Excellent As Expected But The Quality Did Not Compare To Many Other Restaurants We Had Eaten At  Yet The Price Was Very High. I Felt The Standard Needed To Be Pushed Up For The Price That We Paid. Having Said That The Meat For Our Main Courses (Venison And Beef) Were Cooked Very Well. The Starters And Puddings Were A Bit Of A Let-Down. The Breakfast Was Brilliant And The Accommodation Was Too. As Usual The Spa Was Very Nice. My Wife Had Two Treatments; I Had One. Mine Was Fantastic. My Wife Loved The First One (An Oriental Foot Massage) But Was Not Overly Impressed With The Relaxation Body Massage (She's Had This Treatment Here Before And Felt Previous Therapists Had Done It Much Better). Overall The Stay Was Good And We Would Rate It 3/5 (Only Losing Points For The Evening Meals And My Wife's Second Treatment Of The Weekend). ,,,,,
,327,Disappointing. It Is A Nice Hotel  Perfectly Situation And With A Very Good Spa And Restaurant. However There Were Several Things That Were Not Satisfactory.

1. Upon Check In  Our Restaurant Reservation Had Not Been Either Attached To The Booking Or In Your System. So We Had To Rebook
2. The Room We Had  Had No Hot Water  And Took 30Mins To Decide To Move Us To Another Room. There Was No Mention Of Upgrade/Apology/Etc
3. We Took A Little Longer On Our Walk In The Morning. Upon Return My Key Didn't Work. It Was 11.10. It Stopped Working At 11Am Upon Check Out. It Was In A Pocket On It's Own  So Didn't Stop Working Due To Phone/Other Cards Etc.I Think 10Mins After Check Out Time Is A Little Over Zealous To Stop Keys Working. 
4. My Requested Morning Newspaper Did Not Get Delivered. ,,,,,
,330,Very Nice  We Were Made To Fell Very Welcome In All Areas Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,331,The Spa Was Really Good.. Rooms Too Outdated  Staff Were Rude To Myself &Husband. Breakfast Was So Overcooked And Was Very Cold. Couldn't Even Cut The Eggs They Were That Hard!!!!.. Considering I Paid £850:00 I Would Of Exspected The Overall Experiance To Be Of A Very High Standard.. I;E Breakfast To Be Cooked Fresh  Not Left To Be Steamed To An Inch Of Their Life...   Butter On The Table To Be Room Tempreture Not Frozon  Just So I Could Use It On Our Toast!!.Rooms To A High Standard.. Not Having To Wait For 10 Minutes For Drinks.. I Did Send An Email On The 3Rd Febuary Stating I Was Not Atall Happy How Things Were For Us.. And Im Still Waiting For A Reply!!!!.,,,,,
,332,We Find The Carey's Manor A Very Relaxing Break  We Are Made To Feel That We Are The Only People That Mater In This Hotel The Staff Are Very Attentive So We Love Staying Here And Would Recommend This Hotel & Spa To Everyone.,,,,,
,333,Enjoyable But Spa Busy Sat And Our Treatment Times All Messed Up  Which Caused A Bit Of Upset To Our Plans.,,,,,
,334,Good But A Few Glitches,,,,,
,336,A Real Treat In An Environment Where Everything Was Done To Make Our Stay Memorable And Special. Staff Are Tremendously Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,337,Unfortunately There Was A Wedding In The Hotel On The Day We Stayed. I Was Not Advised That This Was The Case. The Result Of This Function Meant That We Were Very Limited To Where We Could Spend Our Time Relaxing  And The Subsequent Evening Celebrations Were There For All To Hear. I Did Complain To The Management On Departure And Am Very Happy With The Way This Was Dealt With.,,,,,
,339,We Had A Lovely Time  Good Service  Excellent Food And We Really Enjoyed The Pool  Steam And Sauna Area.,,,,,
,340,We Thought Your Staff Were All Excellent  The Food In Blereau Was Fantastic  The Massages We Had Were Lovely But.... The Decor Lets You Down - The Corridors Leading To The Rooms Are In Desperate Need Of A Revamp And Having Paid £150 For A Couple Of Treatments As Guests Rather Than Spa Upgrade Guests  The Best They Could Offer By Way Of A Relaxation Room Afterwards Was A Seat In A Corridor.  That Was A Let Down And Well Below Par Considering How Good The Spa Is.  I Appreciate The Upgrade Would Have Allowed Us Use Of The Additional Facilities But I Can Go To My Local Hair Dressers  Have A Massage And Stay In A Relaxation Room Afterwards So For Us It's A Failing That Cast A Shadow Over The Experience I'm Afraid.,,,,,
,341,Very Enjoyable.,,,,,
,342,We Come To Carey's Manor Just To Relax As We Have Very Busy Lives.   We Stayed In The Garden Room Which Made Our Stay Just Perfect.,,,,,
,343,Generally Very Good  Spa And Food Were Great  I Felt The Accommodation Was Not As High As I Expected And Seems Expensive Compared To Other Luxury Spa Hotels We've Been Too,,,,,
,344,I Wanted To Treat My Daughter To A Break With You; She Had Her Wedding Reception With You Back In October 2013 And Stayed At Careys Manor For Two Nights Then.  Her And Her Husband Had Such A Wonderful Time With You That I Thought Your Hotel/Spa Would Be The Perfect Place For A Mother And Daughter Treat And Relaxation.  We Had A Wonderful Time In All Areas Of The Hotel And Can't Wait To Visit Again. I Have Recommended Your Establishment To All My Friends.,,,,,
,346,Unfortunately Both Meals We Had Were Cold. I Could Not Eat My Evening Meal As The Taste Of Cold Cod Put Me Off.  Also At Breakfast The Burner Had Broken So The Eggs  Bacon And Mushrooms Were Cold.  We Also Noticed That The Pool Had Water Marks.  However The One Thing You Can Never Beat Are The Staff They Are Absolutely Great.,,,,,
,347,Very Good But When We Called For Room Service No One Answered A Few Of The Times. Also The Room Cleaning Was Not Grt - A Few Things Were Over Looked,,,,,
,349,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,351,We Had A Lovely Time 
The Only Small Criticism Was The Room We Stayed In Had Some Very Noisy Water Pipes In The Ceiling Which
Woke Us Up Every Time Someone Used The Water During The Night Near Our Room   
Other Than That We Had A Great Time,,,,,
,352,We Had A Lovely Time,,,,,
,353,As Always - A Most Enjoyable Stay. And We Wish To Thank You For The Complimentary Champagne And Chocolates  And Most Of All - The Fine Hospitality So Very Typical Of Carey's Manor  And Hope To See You Soon!...Many Thanks!,,,,,
,354,Blissful! I Loved Every Minute Of Being In The Spa  I Desperately Needed A Break And That Was Exactly What I Got. ,,,,,
,355,Overall A Very Enjoyable Stay Which Was Well Organised With The Hotel Prior To Our Visit. Our Only Negative Was The Service In The Zen Restaurant For A Casual Lunch Whilst Using The Spa. We Were Advised We Could Just Order A Sandwich Without The Need To Book In  Unfortunately This Was Not The Case We Waited For Nearly An Hour And No Less Than 3 Waiters/Waitresses Started To Take Our Order And Then Walked Off. We Had To Complain To Spa Reception To Get Any Service ,,,,,
,357,To Be Honest At First We Were Not Too Impressed As We Had Read The Leaflet And Expected To Be Shown Round And Details Of The Spa Highlighted. We Were Shown A Map. Then My Daughter Could Only Get A Large Black Bracelet Whereas I Had The Pink Smaller One That Fitted Better. These Needed To Be A Good Fit As They Enable Entry To The Spa Area. Then We Found We Had Not Brought £1 To Use The Locker. ..This Is Because The Gym Is Also A Private Gym. However  We Did Manage To Get Our Room Earlier And The Key Was Brought To The Spa. Our Lunch Was Superb In The Thai Restaurant. We Then Met Monika In The Shop Who Was Very Helpful And Very Thoughtful. In Addition To This I Had A Wonderful Massage By Alice. My Daughter Had The Hot Stones Which She Was Looking Forward To  Having Discovered This Type Of Treatment A Few Weeks Before. Her's Was Disappointing As A Bit Disjointed And Not So Enjoyable But The Therapist Was Lovely If Not A Bit Less Practised...The Staff Were Delightful And Very Helpful. Toilet Rolls Seemed To Run Out On The Upper Floors Of The Thai Restaurant And The Spa . One Of The Toilets Did Not Flush Properly. The Hotel And Manor Restaurant Were Fabulous. Wifi Was Not Always Available And Ringing 0 Did Not Solve The Problem As It Is Not Always Manned. When We Left We Had Been Charged Incorrectly In The Tune Of £231 Ish But This Was Resolved Speedily. In Conclusion We Did Have A Wonderful Time And The Staff Are Lovely. Perhaps The Next Time We Would Prefer To Visit When It Is Not So Busy. I Left My Jumper There But It Has Not Been Handed In To Lost And Found. It May Still Be Inside The Locker. ,,,,,
,359,Good With Senspa Excellent ,,,,,
,360,Excellent Spa And Restaurant (Manor),,,,,
,361,Very Impressed With Hotel Staff  They Were Friendly And Extremely Accommodating. Room Better Than Expected. Spa Treatment Excellent   But Have Some Feedback On Other Facilities. ,,,,,
,362,Perfect,,,,,
,363,We Were Very Disappointed With The Quality Of The Hotel  Especially The Bedroom Which We Even Upgraded As It Was Our Wedding Anniversary.  The Standard Of The Room Does Not Justify The Prices You Are Charging And The Shower Was The Worst Shower I Have Ever Used In A Hotel.  I've Used Better Facilities At  Premier Inn.  We Were Very Disappointed.,,,,,
,364,We Had A Fantastic Time At Careys Manor,,,,,
,365,Very Nice,,,,,
,366,Perfect Weekend Stay ,,,,,
,367,Great Service,,,,,
,368,Apart From The Tai Restaurant  Everyone  Cared That Every Single Moment Was A Special Moment For Us. The Meal In The Manor Restaurant Was Excellent. Overall  A Wonderful Experience And We're Looking Forward To Seeing You Again.,,,,,
,369,Service Was Excellent . All Staff Friendly And Helpful . Brilliant All Round Stay.,,,,,
,373,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,374,This Spa Break Was A Birthday Treat For My Daughter And I. It Was An Excellent Over Night Stay  Enjoying Lunch  Dinner  Breakfast And All The Relaxing Spa. Peter The Porter Was Most Helpful When We First Called To See Careys Manor And Showed Us Everything And Made Us Most Welcome  Nothing Was To Much Trouble For Him. This First Visit Helped Us Make Up Our Mind. Also Anya Was Again So Helpful When Making The Reservation For Us.  ,,,,,
,375,Exceptional. Would Of Liked A Big Shower/Bath Tho.,,,,,
,378,Our Stay Was Ok  But A Bit Disappointed..Arriving In Our Bedroom The Building Looked Shabby: Carpet In Corridor  Paints Etc. Bedroom Was Nice  But For Around £200.00 Per Night  There Was No Fridge  Bathroom Door Shabby.. It Was My 50Th Birthday & Some Friend Paid For Champagne & Chocolate: No Card To Let Me Know Where It Came From  The Staff Thought It Was Complimentary..,,,,,
,379,Lovely Relaxing Weekend Doing Nothing Ate In Zen One Night And Main Restaurant Next All Staff Very Friendly          ,,,,,
,381,The Most All Round Exceptional Hotel Experience,,,,,
,382,We Enjoyed It All  Lovely Room  Friendly Staff And A Good Location.  ,,,,,
,383,Absolutely Excellent. Staff Were Lovely And Helpful  Spa Was Excellent And Clean - Facilities All Seemed Up To Scratch. Ate In The Thai Restaurant  French Restaurant And Manor Restaurant And Every Meal Was Fantastic. Did It For Valentines And Could Not Have Been More Perfect  Thank You.,,,,,
,384,Fantastic,,,,,
,385,Very Relaxing  Excellent Service.,,,,,
,386,Very Restful  Food & Facilities Very Good And Staff Very Accommodating.,,,,,
,389,Warm Every Member Of Staff Acknowledged One When Passing One The Gardener Even Told Us About Every Shrub In The Garden While He Scrubbed The Back Passage Floor ,,,,,
,392,Very Relaxing And A Warm And Relaxing Experience. Was Made To Feel Welcome And The Facilities Were Excellent. ,,,,,
,393,Good But A Few Little Problems With The Room But The Staff Dealt With Them Very Effectively.,,,,,
,394,Exceptional Customer Service And Facilities. ,,,,,
,396,I Found Both The Hotel And Spa Were Very Good For A Relaxing Overnight Break.Would Have Expecting A Better Standard Of Breakfast For A Four Star Hotel.,,,,,
,398,Fantastic Break  Everything Was Catered For. Staff Are Lovely  They Deserve High Praise For Delivering Such An Excellent Standard Of Service At All Times. Exactly What We Wanted  Although Some Spa Treatments I Did Think Were Overpriced And That Did Put Me Off. I Would Have Had More If They Were A Little More Reasonably Priced Ie The Manicure. 

Food Worth Every Penny  Afternoon Tea Delightful! ,,,,,
,399,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,401,We Had A Good Time But Was Disappointed At Not Having The Rooms Close To Each Other Like I Had Asked They Moved Us Best They Could But Then We Only Ended Up With One Bottle Of Prosecco Instead Of Three.The Spa Was Far Too Busy Twenty People In The Hydro Pool Is Not My Idea Of Exclusive I Have Been To Careys Spa Many Times This Was The Busiest I Thought You Would Limit Numbers.I Was Also Upset That The Restaurant Did`T Decorate My Sons Pudding With A Happy Birthday Or A Candle As I Did Quote To The Hotel It Was His 18Th.My Last Complaint Was That I Got Overcharged On Our Restaurant Bill By £100 And Had To Go Back To Query This Waste My Time Out Of The Spa And We Stuggled To Get A Drink From The Spa Restaurant As It Was So Busy.Careys Wasn`T Up To Previous Visits.,,,,,
,403,Really Good Day Break And The Staff In Spa And Hotel Very Helpful.
Great Service From All Areas And Really High Standards. First Time At Spa And They Took Care If All Needs. The Hydro Pool Area Is Amazing And Best Spa Day. Well Done All ,,,,,
,405,Great Hotel And Fabulous Spa!,,,,,
,406,Blissful As Always!,,,,,
,407,A Great Stay At The Hotel  Lovely Room And Very Nice And Friendly Staff. We Will Be Back,,,,,
,408,I Really Enjoyed The Stay For The Most Part.  The Food Was Delicious And We Were Impressed With The Service  Particularly In The Manor Restaurant.  However We Were Very Disappointed To Discover How Expensive And Complicated It Was To Upgrade Our Spa Use To The Hydrotherapy Pool Etc.  We Also Had To Wait A Long Time To Check Out As Despite It Being Check Out Time And There Being A Queue Of People  There Was Still Only One Person On The Desk.,,,,,
,409,Once Checked In  The Experience Was Restful And Staff Courteous And Welcoming.  There Was A Long Wait To Check Into The Hotel As Only One Person On The Desk.  There Was Queue At Senspa But We Were Given A Drink Whilst We Waited.  ,,,,,
,410,From Start To Finish Every Part Of Our Stay Was Fantastic But What Made Our Stay The Best Was The Staff  Every Single Member Of Staff  Waiters  Receptionists Therapists  Cleaners Were Unbelievable And Made Us Feel Very Special And Would Come Back Just For The Service Alone ,,,,,
,411,Very Warm Welcome From The Moment I Opened The Car Door. Overall Very Comfortable And Relaxing ,,,,,
,412,We Had A Truly Lovely Time At Careys Manor. My Partner And I Felt The Place Was Excellent In That It Was A High Quality Hotel Whilst The Service And Staff Remained Friendly  Attentive And Welcoming (Which Is Definitely Not Always The Case In Many 'Good Quality' Hotels). This Made Our Stay Much More Enjoyable And Relaxing And Is The Reason We Will Definitely Be Coming Back  Thank You. Also We Loved The Lounge Room Next To The Bar. It Was A Beautiful Setting To Enjoy A Bottle Of Wine. ,,,,,
,413,We Had A Lovely Time At Careys Manor.  I Only Booked It The Evening Before  So A Bit Last Minute.  We Arrived At Noon And Were Able To Access Our Room As It Was Ready  So That Was Nice.  We Came On A Detox Spa Break Which Included A Free Treatment  But It Cause A Bit Of Confusion As The Deal Promised Complimentary Selected Refreshments.  As We Were Hungry When We Arrived We Asked About These Refreshments At The Spa Reception And Were Told To Go To The Zen Restaurant And They Were Unsure Of What We Were Allowed To Have.  Anyway  They Found Out And Told Us We Could Have Free Drinks Upstairs  But Would Have To Pay For Lunch.  So We Ordered Lunch In The Zen Restaurant Which Was Very Nice.  Later We Went Upstairs And Had Some Complimentary Drinks.  We Greatly Enjoyed The Spa And Especially Liked The Fact That We Were Not On Some Time Limit But Could Enjoy A Full Two Days Of Relaxation.,,,,,
,414,A Beautiful Spa Hotel Offering Excellent Spa Facilities And Our Room  Overlooking The Gardens Was  As Always  First Class.,,,,,
,415,Amazing  Complete Indulgence And Utter Relaxation! ,,,,,
,416,A Very Pleasant Break  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble,,,,,
,417,Relaxing ,,,,,
,418,A Great Relaxing Break,,,,,
,419,Enjoyable ,,,,,
,420,Very Restful  Very Friendly And Helpful Staff  Clean And Comfortable. Most Enjoyable.,,,,,
,421,Excellent From Start To Finish.,,,,,
,423,Lovely Up Until We Were Woken By A Member Of Staff Entering Our Room At 240 In The Morning As He Thought The Room Wasn't Occupied ,,,,,
,424,I Came To Celebrate My Hen Do With A Small Group Of Friends. We All Thoroughly Enjoyed Every Minute! Just A Shame We Couldn't Stop The Clock From Ticking. Amazing Food  Loved The Rooms We Had (We Were Upgraded To Oakwood)  Very Friendly And Helpfull Staff. Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. It's A Very Special Place To Celebrate Special Occasions. Can't Wait For My Next Visit - Soon I Hope!!,,,,,
,425,Spa Was Great  Food Was Great  Service In Mannor Resaturant Was Very Good  But Our Room Was A Bit Of A Dissapointment For The Cost And Felt The Overall Decor Was Dated - All In All A Nice Break But We Felt Not Quite Value For Money. Also Our Bill Was Wrong On Check Out Which Is Always A Bit Awkward.,,,,,
,426,Great Area  Great Food. Lovely Attention From Staff  And Wonderful Spa,,,,,
,429,I Have Stayed Twice Before And Had Wonderful Times In Every Way But This Time Was Not Quite So Good. We Were In Room 79 And Somewhere Near An Entrance And Exit Door Possible Staff Of Customers But It Had A High Volume Of People Passed Through It  Every Time The 2 Doors Banged Loudly. I Was Woken By This Many Times And After My Treatment And Spa Day We Were Relaxing In Our Room And Having A Nap Only To Be Woken Again By The Damn Door.This Door May Sound Petty To Some But I Go Away To Relax And Have A Lay In And Hate Being Woken Every 2 Mins When Someone Walks Out The Door.   Also I Felt The Room Could Have Done With A Little Updating As Was Not As Nicely Decorated As The Last Stay And Quite Old Fashioned And A Bit Tatty In Places.The Food Was Lovely Though.,,,,,
,430,Fantastic - Service From All Employees Was Amazing  Great Facilities And Great Food.,,,,,
,431,From When We Arrived To When We Left The Experience Was One Of Complete Relaxation. All Staff Member Are So Friendly And Welcoming  Always Happy To Help. The Man That Showed Us To Our Room (Sorry Can't Remember Name! Young Lad With Glasses) Was So Attentive And Friendly. When We Left We Had A Chat To Roy Who Was So Knowledgeable And Very Interesting. The Free Room Upgrade Was A Really Nice Touch As Were The Chocolates In The Room. When We Asked For A Ice Bucket And Glasses They Were Brought Straight To The Room And Our Bottle Of Cava Was Perfectly Chilled For When We Returned To Our Room From The Spa. The Spa Is Very Well Kept And Treatments Were Nice. Our Meal In The Evening (In The Thai Restaurant) Was Delicious And Amongst Some Of The Best Thai Food We Have Tasted (And We've Eaten A Lot Of Thai Food In The Past!!!) My Partner Said It Was The Best He Had Ever Had! Although One Of The Waiters (Again I Didn't Get A Name!) Was A Little Abrupt With Me When I Asked If I Would Need A Side Dish To Go With My Main. (This Is The Only Negative Of The Entire Stay With You) The Guy Behind The Bar Makes A Mean Cosmopolitan And Long Island Ice Tea And Was Again Very Welcoming. I Remember Him From My Stay In September And His Level Of Service Then Was Also Excellent!  Overall The Stay Was Fantastic And I Wouldn't Hesitate To Return. As For My Partner It Was His First Ever Spa Break And He Absolutely Loved It!! I'm Sure We Will Return Soon. Thank You To All The Staff We Came Into Contact With During Our Stay,,,,,
,433,Wonderful - We Love Staying At Carey's Manor.,,,,,
,434,We Had A Wonderful Time  The Sen Spa Was So Different From Any Other Spa Stay We Have Had  My Friends Really Enjoyed Their Treatments  Unfortunately I Didn't Book Any  But Will Next Time. The French Restaurant Was Yummy And The Staff Were The Best. The Rooms Were Comfortable. Wish It Had Been A Longer Stay. ,,,,,
,435,Restaurants Service And Bar Very Good   Reception Good  Rooms Standard Good  Food Quality Very Good. Thai Restaurant Excellent  Manor Restaurant Excellent. Had A Drink At French Restaurant   A Very Warm Welcome And Also Looked Appealing. Spa Was Nice. We Asked About The Spa But A Vauge Description Was Given  No Info On What Works Best With What  And I Saw People Had Pool Shoes Etc. Where They Got Them I Will Never Know. We Had A Treatment And The Lady Who Took Us To The Room Was Very Informative. Think They Are Too Busy To Take Time To Explain Things We Just Found It All Our Selves  But A Couple Arrived Late Afternoon We Saw For Spa Afternoon Sat Down And Had A Full Explanation. Oh Well It Wont Put Us Off But This Was The Only Unnatentive Area Of The Hotel That We Found  But A Big Factor As This Was The Main Reason Of Our Visit.,,,,,
,437,Wonderful Relaxing Time,,,,,
,439,Absolutely Wonderful And Very Relaxing. Great Facilities And Probably The Best Customer Service I've Received In Years. The Staff Are Friendly And Incredibly Helpful-Always Willing To Go The Extra Mile If There Was Anything We Needed. ,,,,,
,440,Fantastic In Every Way.,,,,,
,441,Absolutely Lovely  Great Rooms  Good Food  Lovely Staff And The Spa Was Great Fun,,,,,
,442,Great Time Lovely Venue  Staff  Sen Spa  Room And Restuarant,,,,,
,444,Very Enjoyable And Comfortable,,,,,
,445,Very Enjoyable Time And Excellent Food And Service. ,,,,,
,448,Very Nice Weekend  Staff Very Friendly  A Very Good Choice For Breakfast But  I Did Have To Wait Along For The Staff To Top Up The Fried Eggs And Time They Came My Breakfast Was Cold.

The Bedrooms Were Very Comfortable And Clean.,,,,,
,449,The People Were Lovely  Plenty Of Them And Willing To Help. Rooms Lovely And Spacious. Food Excellent. Spa Experience Relaxing. 
We Were A Bunch Of Uni Friends On A Re-Union  Had A Great Time And Would Come Back Again Which We Wouldnt Say About All Our Weekend Away. Great Job,,,,,
,450,Excellent. Lovely Hotel And Wonderful Spa Facilities. All The Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful. ,,,,,
,451,Good Service By Professional Friendly Staff - Without Exception Everyone We Encountered Smiled And Spoke - And Very Enjoyable French Style Food In The Gallic Ambiance Of Le Blaireau.   We First Went There When It Opened Many Years Ago  And You Have Kept Up The Style And Standard.   Your Dinner  Bed And Breakfast Special Offer Was Amazing Value.   Thank You For Yet Another Relaxing Couple Of Days. ,,,,,
,452,Beyond Reproach.  All Staff Without Exception Very Pleasing.,,,,,
,453,We Thought The Staff Were Fantastic And The Food In The Restaurant Was Top Notch. The Spa Was Delightful . We Felt That The Decor Generally In The Manor House Was Rather Tired And Soulless . We Felt The Same About The Corridors Where Our Room Was Located. The Carpets Didn't  Smell Very Clean Or Fresh. Despite Being Warned That The Water For Our Bath Would Be Scalding Hot This Wasn't The Case.,,,,,
,454,Top Notch Attention To Detail. Fabulous Staff Fabulous Experience,,,,,
,455,Very Dated Now Since Last Visit  No Signs Anywhere So Easy To Get Lost.  Feel In Desperate Need Of Modernisation As Does Not Feel Like A Posh Hotel Anymore.  Staff Though All Very Polite And Helpful,,,,,
,456,Service  Rooms And Pool Were Good But We Didnt Come Away Feeling That We Had Had A Luxury Weekend.,,,,,
,457,The Staff Are Wonderful And The Dinner/Cocktails Were To Die For!!! ,,,,,
,458,A Fine Relaxing Time.,,,,,
,459,A Lovely Relaxing Treat Staff All Very Welcoming And Helpful,,,,,
,460,Very Friendly Staff  And Very Helpfull
Food Was Excellent  Could Not Fault Anything With The Restaurant Or Staff
It Would Have Been Perfect If The Spa Pool Had Been Included In The Price As This Was The Only Down Side  Especially As We Were Only There For A Short Stay  Other Than This Most Enjoyable  And If The Spa Pool Was Included  We Would Most Probably Stay Again.,,,,,
,461,Excellent Service. Evening Meal Disappointing. Treatments Very Good.,,,,,
,463,Amazing We Both Really Enjoyed Our Stay The Food Was Great Rooms Clean And Comfortable. The Spa And Pool Are So Relaxing Looking Forward To Coming Back. ,,,,,
,464,Overall Very Enjoyable. Nice Big Room. Clean. Great Service In Spa And Thai Restaurant. 

Only Complaint Would Be Quality Of Coffee In The Bar/Lounge. It Was Appalling. For £7 For Two Coffees You'd Expect Much Much Better. ,,,,,
,465,We Are Still Here For Another Two Nights And Have Stayed On Many Occasions Before. We Always Feel Very Welcome And Are Remembered By Many Members Of Staff.,,,,,
,466,We Had A Lovely Relaxing Time. The Staff Are A Credit To The Hotel And Were So Helpful And Friendly. Our Oak Wood Garden Room Was Very Comfortable And Clean. The Food In Both The Manor And Zen Garden Restaurants Was Excellent And The Spa Was Sheer Bliss!,,,,,
,467,Part Good  Part Bad. The Manor Restaurant Was Dreadful! No Atmosphere  Nearly Empty  Very Dim Lighting & Poor Selection Of Food Which Was Cooked Only To An Average Standard. However  Having Learned The Hard Way We Avoided The Manor For The Remainder Of Our Stay & Dined At The Thai Restaurant Which Was Quite Excellent. More Atmosphere  More Customers And Much Better Food.
,,,,,
,468,Great Food And Service. All Staff Were Friendly And Helpful. The Decor Of The Room Was Excellent But We Feel The Communal Areas (Corridoors  Lounge  Restaurants  Pool) Were A Bit 'Tired' Or Worn. Whilst We Enjoyed Our Stay  We Expected A Bit More From A 4 Star Hotel. It Would Also Have Been Nice To Have A Fridge In The Room.,,,,,
,469,Enjoyable,,,,,
,470,Enjoyed It Very Much And The Food Was Delicious,,,,,
,472,I Could Not Fault The Staff  From The Guy Who Helped Us With Our Suitcase  Ray Or Roy  To The Head Guy At The Thai Restaurant. The Young Lady On Reception Was Very Helpful And Friendly And Made Us Feel Relaxed. The Rooms Were A Little Dated  And Our View From Our Window Was The Only Poor Thing Of Our Stay. Evening Meal Was Good With Nice Wine Selection And The French Restaurant Looked Good Fun Place To Eat.,,,,,
,473,Very Relaxing Break.,,,,,
,474,Wonderful Old School Service In Relaxing Surroundings ,,,,,
,475,Average Would Be Our Main Word  A Lot Of Potential Wasted Due To Lack Of Care.,,,,,
,476,My Husband And I Were On Our 1St Wedding Anniversary  We Had An Amazing Time In The Spa On The Saturday  The Full Body Massage We Has Was Amazing Best I Have Ever Had. We Had Dinner At The Thai Restaurant  Food Was Fab. 

The Only Feedback I Would Have But Cant Be Helped Is I Have Been To The Spa On A Weekday And Not A Weekend Before  So It Was A Little Crowded Then I Had Experienced Before  Making It Difficult To Use All The Facilities  But As I Said Im Sure This Is A Standard Weekend As Most People Are Off Of A Weekend. 
,,,,,
,477,Fab Fab Fab 6 Ladies Came And Had A Great Time  Love The Pool And Treatments.Food Was Great .,,,,,
,479,This Was A Mixture Of Our 1St Wedding Anniversary And A Babymoon (Im 8 Months Pregnant) And We Could Not Have Had A Better Weekend.  The Food In Your Thai And The Manor House Restuarant Was Out Of This World  Your Spa Facilities Were Amazing And The Rooms Were Spotless.  A Strange Thing To Comment On But The Shower Products In Your Spa Showers Were Amazing Aswell.  We Think You May Have Been Pumping Some Kind Of Zen Mist Through Your Air Conditioning As We Could Not Have Been More Relaxed The Whole Weekend!
We Have Not Stopped Recommending Your Hotel To Everyone We Have Met  So Thank You So Much For Making It Such A Perfect Weekend For Us.,,,,,
,480,We Love Staying At Careys Manor - The Staff Are Excellent And We Love The Sen Spa,,,,,
,481,Great/Relaxing,,,,,
,483,Excellent - The Only Dissapointment Is That We Ordered Room Service On Saturday 22Nd Which Never Arrived. ,,,,,
,484,Absolutely Amazing!,,,,,
,486,Had A Wonderful Break With My Husband. I Mentioned It Was His Birthday When Booking In And It Was Really Nice That You Left A Balloon And Chocolates In Our Room. Also The Restaurant Staff Wished Him A Happy Birthday As Well With More Balloons And Chocolates. Really Made The Weekend Extra Special And A Great Bit Of Customer Service,,,,,
,487,Disappointed With The Spa  As When My Mother Booked She Was Told That We Could Use The Whole Of The Spa But When We Arrived We Were Only Entitled To The Pool  Steam And Sauna Room  So After Half An Hour We Had Had Enough - We Could Of Gone In The Other Part At A Price!  Also We Had Dinner Booked In The Bistro And Were Told When Ordered There Were No Mussels - As It Is Quite A Limited Menu We Would Have Expected Them To Have Been Available.  Apart From That It Was A Pleasant Stay.,,,,,
,488,On The Whole A Very Relaxing And Enjoyable Weekend,,,,,
,489,Excellent From The Moment Peter Looked After Us So Well When We Arrived And Showed Us Round To The Lovely Pool And Massage On Sunday. The Bit In Between Was Good Too!,,,,,
,490,Generally Very Good. One Or Two Comments:
At The Thai Restaurant After I Had Signed The Meal To My Room I Was Asked Several Times Whether I Had Signed. The Manager Checked In Front Of Staff And Guests With Several Members Of Staff Before Believing I Had Signed! This Was Embarrassing And Totally Unnecessary In Front Of Other Guests!
On A Less Important Note The Bread For Breakfast Was Not Very Inspiring (White Bread Pretending To Be Brown). At This Price I Would Expect A Selection Of Good Quality Breads. ,,,,,
,491,Staff Very Friendly And Foot Outstanding. Let Down A Bit By Poor Attention To Detail (Chipped Door  Dirt On Linen  Lots Of Used Cups Unattended And No Tea/Coffee In Communal Spa Relaxation Room For Over An Hour.,,,,,
,492,I Was Disappointed As This Was My 4Th Time At Careys Manor. I Was Under The Impression That I Had Paid Extra For The Luxury Garden Room So Was Highly Disappointed To Be On The 1St Floor. This Could Not Be Changed. Secondly On My Previous Visits The Spa Had Been Very Relaxing. On This Occasion It Was Clearly Over Booked And Roudy. Not What I Expect For My Bill Totally 800+. ,,,,,
,493,A Very Relaxing And Pleasant Couple Of Days,,,,,
,495,Great Fun  Extremely Relaxing  Really Scrumptiously Tasty  Fabulous Value.,,,,,
,496,Fantastic. It Was My Mums 84Th Birthday And She Loved The Prosecco  Card And Balloon In Her Room. Bleireaus Also Sang Happy Birthday And Put Candles In Her Dessert. An Old Lady Was V Happy!,,,,,
,502,We Were Underwhelmed,,,,,
,503,Luxurious  Great Service  Excellent Facilities - Worth Every Penny.,,,,,
,504,We  Enjoyed Every Moment From Room To The Bar And Dinner,,,,,
,505,Relaxing  Indulgent  And Just What Was Needed!,,,,,
,507,It Was A Very Good  If Very Expensive  Experience.  We Were Looked After Very Well  And I Am Very  Very Grateful For Who Ever It Was That I Spoke To And Arranged The Flowers With.,,,,,
,508,I Enjoyed Myself But Was Disappointed That I Couldn't Get A Reservation For A Spa Treatment Or In The Thai Restaurant On Our 2Nd Night And I Didn't Feel That Anyone Tried To Appease Us Or Squeeze Us In,,,,,
,509,After A Difficult Two Years  An Excellent Perfect Stay And Just What We Needed  - Though All To Brief.   As We Reside In Hampshire Will Be Calling As Passing With  Father. ,,,,,
,510,I Always Look Forward To Come To Careys Manor And Senspa It Is An Annual Treat. I Like The Relaxed Atmosphere And The Thai Restaurant. The Only Reason I Have Put 'Good' Rather Than 'Excellent' Which I Would Normally Put Is Because Previously We Have Always Had A Room With A Safe And We Were Not Told The Room Would Not Have One So That Was Slightly Inconvenient. The Nice Person Who Showed Us To Our Room Infact Said There Was One So We Hunted Everywhere. We Were In Room 12 In The Manor. We Actually Liked The Room Very Much Particularly As On This Occasion It Had A View.
Also We Arrived Early At Around 1.30Pm. We Were Very Pleased To Be Able To Use The Spa Early Which Was  A Bonus And A Good Selling Point Of Careys Over Other Spa's When Your Journey Is Quicker Than Expected You Don't Have To Hang Around.
As Anticipated The Room Was Not Ready Which We Did Not Expect. However We Were Told The Keys Could Be Left In The Spa For Us For Ease So We Could Get Them After 3Pm Conveniently Which We Liked The Idea Of. We Took Up The Offer And Also Mentioned It To The Spa Reception When We Went Over And They Said No Problem. When We Were Ready To Leave The Spa In Our Dressing Gowns To Go To The Room After Relaxing In The Relaxation Area Upstairs For A Couple Of Hours The Keys Had Been Forgotten. The Girl Apologised And Went To Get Them. ~These Things Happen And That Was Okay. But It Was At Least 15-20 Minutes Before The Keys Arrived And The Lady From The Perfume And Costume Shop Actually Saw Us Waiting And Went To The Hotel Reception To Find Out. ....We Had Not Complained As It Was Just One Of Those Things But It Is Cold In That Entrance Area As The Doors Go To The Outside And By This Time We Were Cold And Tired And Just Wanted A Room To Go To. Had We Not Been Offered The Keys We Would Have Been Happy To Dress In The Spa And Collect Them Ourselves Earlier In The Afternoon Around 4Pm. It Meant By The Time We Got Our Bags From The Car We Were Not In Our Room Until 6.30Pm.
The Plus Was We Had A Room With A View. Lovely Room. Thai Restaurant Was Wonderful As Usual. We Enjoyed Using The 'Inner Hydro Facilities On The Following Day For An Extra Fee Which Is A Bonus.
So Other Than The Few Things We Were Content.,,,,,
,512,Perfect.,,,,,
,513,The Stay Was Excellent As Were The Staff  I Didn't Rate The English Cook Breakfast As It Was Cold And Have Stayed In Other Hotels Were It Is Freshly Cooked,,,,,
,515,Lovely Hotel. Great Breakfasts  Friendly Staff  But No Real Areas To Relax If Not Using Spa. A Better Bar Area Would Be Better. We Had Our Son With Us And Realise It Is Not A Hotel For Children  But Very Good For Adults Only.,,,,,
,516,Excellent Standards And Staff For A Perfect Stay. ,,,,,
,517,Good But The Very Poor Internet Connection Is A Barrier To Staying While I Have Important Business To Transact. It's Vital The Hotel Installs Higher Speed Access When Neither 3G Or 4G Is Available Locally,,,,,
,520,Really Lovely. All Staff Were Really Friendly.,,,,,
,522,Very Relaxing & Full Of Treats.,,,,,
,524,Pleasurable And Relaxing.,,,,,
,525,From The Moment We Arrived We Were Treated Like V.I. P.All The Staff Were Extremely Helpful.The Bar & Restaurant Staff Especially .We Will Be Back. ,,,,,
,526,Perfect.,,,,,
,528,It Was Very Relaxing The Staff Were Helpful And Friendly,,,,,
,529,A Relaxing Forty-Eight Hours With Fabulous Breakfasts And Use Of The Pool Etc,,,,,
,530,Relaxing,,,,,
,531,Amazing Spa.. Nice Staff. The Room Wasnt As Good As Id Expected  The Food Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,532,Fantastic Experience From Start To Finish. Staff Where Very Friendly Food Was Great. And The Room Was Perfect The Bed Was Really Comfy ,,,,,
,533,Outstanding Staff Attitude Friendly Helpful And Welcoming.Particularly Reception And Manor Restaurant.Comfortable Bed And Decently Appointed Bedroom And Bathroom. Some Problems With Tv Controls And Phone.
Very Decent Choice(Particularly Veggie) And Excellent Quality In Manor Restaurant. Enjoyed Pianist. Breakfast Fruit Choices Could Possibly Be More Imaginative (No Berries).Also Need Malt Vinegar For Kippers.
My Wife Had Massage  Otherwise Didn't Use Spa.,,,,,
,534,Disappointing,,,,,
,535,Overall The Experience Was Good.  We Did Have Some Minor Issues - Examples Below:
- Room Door Keys Constantly Not Working Even Though They Weren't Next To Anything Else In Our Bags.  Just Kept Deactivating So We Had To Keep Going To Reception To Get Them Activated
- We Ordered Drinks With Breakfast And We Had To Ask 3 Different People For Tea Which Came After About 20 Mins
- A Spa Cost Was Added To Our Room Bill In Error For £50 But Luckily I Check All My Bills So This Was Removed
,,,,,
,536,The Spa Made Our Visit. 
We Like The Location. However Just Little Improvements To Rooms Etc Would Help The Experience.,,,,,
,537,Not Brilliant. We Paid Over £200 For One Night Per Room And Were Put In The Worst Rooms The Hotel Offers. I Had To Move Rooms In The Middle Of The Night Having Discovered The Door Leading To The "Garden" Was Open When I Made Sure They Were Secure Before I Left For The Evening As I Was A Single Female Staying On My Own. The Room I Moved To Was Very Good And I Do Not Understand Why We Could Not Have Had Similar To Begin With If They Were Available. Marcel The Night Manager Was Excellent And Moved Me Straight Away  He Is A Credit To The Hotel. The Gentleman I Spoke With On Checking Out Didn't Seem To Care What Had Happened As I Bought It Up And He Said Oh Yes I Heard About That But Didn't Offer Any Sort Of Apology For Unconvinced Caused. He Was Incredibly Dismissive. ,,,,,
,539,Very Relaxing. The Staff Were Very Helpful And Friendly And We Definitely Had The Chilled Out Experience We Had Hoped For.,,,,,
,540,The Spa And Thai Were As Always Excellent  However I Have Stayed A Number Of Times Over The Past Five Years And I Feel The Hotel Is Now Tiring And The Food In The Main Restaurants Has Deteriorated Noticeably,,,,,
,542,A Really Great And Restful Break Away And Marvellous Bonus Of Being Able To Use The Spa,,,,,
,544,Very Disappointing. Hotel Is In Need Of A Complete Refurbishment. Staff And Food Excellent But Ambiance  Is Non Exsistant. Never Have We Been To A Hotel Where We Have Felt Ripped Off. Could Not Recommend It As You Do Not Get Value For Money.  Felt Really Let Down After Having Great Expectations.,,,,,
,545,Very Enjoyable Break  Excellent Food  Very Friendly Staff.,,,,,
,546,Very Attentive Service From The Moment We Arrived. Beautiful Surroundings. Marvellous Food.,,,,,
,547,Excellent Facilities Together With Superb Food.  Excellent Service.  Would Highly Recommend.,,,,,
,548,A Very Pleasurable Experience  All The Staff Were Very Nice And Helpful. The Spa Was Wonderful And The Food At The Zen Garden And Le Blaireau Was Excellent. ,,,,,
,549,Slightly Eccentric,,,,,
,552,Very Relaxing  At Ease  Very Helpful Staff,,,,,
,553,Very Relaxing  Lovely Surprise Having A Complimentary Upgrade In Our Vroom Due To Our Engagement! Loved The Spa  Cocktail Bar And Breakfast! Everything Was Just Amazing!! ,,,,,
,554,Excellen,,,,,
,555,A Great Short Break,,,,,
,556,A Very Relaxing Stay. The Spa Is Very Good The Food In The Manor Restaurant Was Excellent As Was The Service.,,,,,
,557,Very Good ,,,,,
,558,First Class Service  Great Food And In A Very Relaxing Atmosphere! Loved It!!,,,,,
,560,Wonderful  Always Is:),,,,,
,561,Best Spa Ive Ever Been To!,,,,,
,562,8/10,,,,,
,563,The Stay Exceeded All Expectations  The Food And Facilities Were Fantastic. Didn't Want To Leave.,,,,,
,564,The Most Relaxing Spa Break Ever! The Spa Is Wonderful. The Food [Lunch Zen Garden  Dinner Manor] Was Lovely. The Staff Was Very Friendly. I Have One Or Two Suggestions To Make  But That Didn't Detract From Our Overall Experience Which Was Fabulous  Including Welcome Note And Chocolates From The Manager [ For Our Anniversary],,,,,
,565,Brilliant,,,,,
,566,Being In The Trade  I Tried To Book Directly To Get Your Best Deal And Was Quoted £265 For Room Only - Then Found It On Booking.Com At £165 - I Then Phoned Your Hotel Again Knowing That You Pay Commission And Was Told To Book It With Booking.Com - This Is Just Giving Money To Booking.Com Which Is Crazy!!  The Windows Of The Room 40 Were Dirty And Had Birds Mess On Them.  This Said  What A Lovely Hotel You Have And Great Staff  We Had A Great Time - Thank You And Your Team..,,,,,
,567,The Food Was Delicious 
Senspa Very Relaxing
Lighting In Room Very Poor Struggled To Read Paper
Unsightly View Out Of Our Room 15
But Overall A Lovely Stay


,,,,,
,568,Great  As Expected.,,,,,
,571,Staff Were Excellent  Food Good But Overall The Hotel Needs A Little Attention In Certain Areas And Also Felt Overpriced.
,,,,,
,572,Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay. The Pedicure Though Quite Expensive Was Excellent. Food Was Great And Service Throughout Was Fantastic,,,,,
,573,Please Note That All Staff Were Very Professional In All Areas Of The Hotel.  The Food Was Excellent And Overall There Really Is Nothing To Say That Is Negative. The New Forest Is Lovely And We Will Return At Some Stage In The Future.,,,,,
,574,Relaxing,,,,,
,575,Excellent. Beautiful Hotel  Great Location  Wonderful Spa. Wish I Could Have Checked In Earlier And Checked Out Later. ,,,,,
,577,Overall Very Good Couple Of Minor Points  But Generally Very Impressed With Friendliness And Helpfulness Of Staff,,,,,
,578,Staff Excellent  Anna Is A Gem In The Restaurant I Think She Is Getting The Hang Of It Now! ,,,,,
,579,The High Point Was The Thai Restaurant  We Found The Food Fabulous. The Service By The Hotel Staff Was Excellent And Friendly  And The Treatments Offered Bt The Spa Were Very Professional. The Breakfast Was Of Very High Standard And Excellent Quality.
Our Only Area For Improvement Is The Quality Of The Bedrooms And Bathrooms  We Stayed In Room 85 In Knightwood  The Bathroom Has A Dated Feel And The Bedroom Also Could Do With Updating. The Bathroom Fixtures Are Tired And In Need Of Upgrading And Replacement. It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Mini Bar In The Room...Never The Less We Enjoyed Our Stay Overall.

Paul And Ally Edwards,,,,,
,580,Relaxing And Made To Feel Welcome. ,,,,,
,581,Place Was Lovely. Staff Were Lovely. Very Relaxing Atmosphere. Just Settled In And Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,
,582,We Always Have A Lovely Time At Careys Manor  The Staff Are Extremely Helpful And Make You Feel Special. The Food Is Excellent As Well As The Accommodation. The Senspa Is The Best That We Have Been To And Always Come Away From Both There And Careys Manor Completely Relaxed. This Is Why We Come Back And Will Continue To Do So......Keep Up The Good Work! ,,,,,
,583,We Stayed At Careys Manor To Celebrate Our 4 Year Wedding Anniversary. We Had A Wonderful Time And The Staff Were Lovely And Attentive And Shared In Our Celebration. Our Only Criticism Is That We Had Booked A Table In The French Bistro For An 8.30Pm Sitting  When We Arrived There Was Another Table Who Had Also Just Seated Consisting Of 2 Toddlers And A Child Under 1 As Well As Another Table Which Had A Toddler. Booking A Table At This Time We Thought We Would Have Avoided This And Having The Toddlers Running Around Like The Restaurant Was A Creche And The Baby Crying The Entire Time Was Very Uncomfortable And Unpleasant. We Could Tell The Staff Were Also Uncomfortable With This Which Was Understandable. It Would Be Advisable To Have Children Of This Age Restricted From The Restaurant After A Certain Time So People Can Enjoy Their Meal In Peace Within A Lovely Ambience. ,,,,,
,584,Very Relaxing And Comfortable Experience In A Wonderful Luxury Environment With Lovely Helpful Staff. ,,,,,
,585,My Husband And I Had A Wonderful Weekend Celebrating Our Anniversary At Careys Manor. Customer Service  Restaurants  Spa Facilities All Excellent.,,,,,
,587,Your Staff Are A Credit To You And We're Absolutely Wonderful. Very Friendly And Attentive. Our Tv Wasn't Working And Within Minutes Someone Was There To Fix It. The Lift To The Station Was A Nice Touch  The Thai Restaurant Was A Pleasure To Eat In. The French One.....Although On Our First Night We Arrived To Eat Without Booking We Were Turned Away Even Though There Was Approx 8 People Currently Dining At That Time  We Could Have Been In And Out Within An Hour But Wasn't Given Any Option So We Went To The Rose And Crown Instead. On A Two Night Stay It Would Have Been Nice To Be Allowed Access To The Spa Pools Etc  Especially As We Had Spent A Fair Bit On Two Massages. The Spa Treatment We Had By Two Lovely Ladies Was Also Exceptional. My Partner And I Work Within Very Stressful Jobs And This Break Was Ideal  Just A Shame We Can't Afford To Come More Often.,,,,,
,589,Very Enjoyable And Would Recommend ,,,,,
,591,Was Exactly As Expected  Room Was Better Than We Thought Meal Was Excellent Service Just Perfect,,,,,
,592,My Husband And I Visited The New Forest For The First Time And Chose To Stay At The Careys Manor For Practical Reasons As It Is Very Close To The Train Station.  The Fact That It Is A Spa Is A Bonus And We Enjoyed Some Relaxing Time In The Sauna  Pool And Jacuzzi. We Did Our Research And Read The Reviews Online And Were Not Disappointed.  We Had A Fantastic Time.  The Hotel Is Stunning  The Members Of Staff Are First Class  Very Helpful And Friendly.  The Facilities Are Excellent And The Food Is Divine.  Very Good Attention To Detail. The Only Improvement I Can Suggest Is To Provide More Bike Racks Next To The Spa Or In Another Sheltered Area. I Will Definitely Recommend The Place To My Friend And Come Back Again.
Many Thanks For Making Our Stay So Memorable.,,,,,
,593,Lovely. ,,,,,
,594,I Stayed With My Partner At Careys Manor Hotel And Senspa For One Night. We Were There On A Leisure Break Together And Made Use Of The Pool  Jacuzzi And Sauna/Steam Room Facilities While We Were Staying. We Also Had A Dinner Reservation In The Le Blaireau Bistro Restaurant. Overall I Would Class The Stay As Excellent. The Staff Were Very Friendly Right From Arrival And Even Recovered The Luggage From The Car And Offered To Park It Closer To The Room For Convenience! The Porter That Showed Us To Our Room Also Made A Concerned Effort To Help Us Find Our Way Around And Generally Feel At Home.
The Room Was Spotless And Had A Very Welcoming Feel And Pleasing Decor. It Was Also A Very Good Size For The Two Of Us Plus Our Bags And Things.
Overall We Were Very Pleased With Our Stay And Hope To Return Soon And Use The Senspa Facilities!!,,,,,
,595,Every Thing Was As Good As We Hoped It Would Be
,,,,,
,596,Very Pleasant,,,,,
,597,I Have Been Before And Was Impressed  However This Time I Felt It Had Gone Downhill.,,,,,
,599,Felt Very Special .. Treated With Curtesy & Respect  Thank You.,,,,,
,600,Fantastic Very Welcoming The Staff Were Extremely Friendly & Helpful.  The Facilities Were Excellent. ,,,,,
,601,Friendly   Welcoming   Clean & Helpful,,,,,
,602,Pleasant And Genuinely Friendly,,,,,
,603,Perfection In A Spa,,,,,
,604,Excellent Facilities And Excellent Service,,,,,
,606,Pleasant And Relaxing.,,,,,
,607,A Little Disappointing  Everyone Very Friendly  But Facilities And Decor Not Quite Up To Scratch. Our Room Was Nicely Located However  Several Irritations With It Let It Down. No Soap Dishes  Shower Door Not Fixed  Shower Head Too Low Had To Stoop To Try To Get Under It  When U Sit At The Bedroom Mirror Only The Top Of My Head Was Visible In The Mirror.  Tv On The Small Side  One Bathroom Light Didn't Work. Problems With Door Key. Air Con Rather Unreliable. ,,,,,
,608,Warm Welcome  Relaxing And Pleasant Surroundings. ,,,,,
,609,We Always Enjoy Staying At Careys Manor ,,,,,
,610,Very Relaxing  Delicious Food And Drink In Beautiful Surroundings. Spa Was Just What We Needed. Delightful.,,,,,
,611,I Have Been Previously And Felt It Had Gone Down Hill,,,,,
,613,In The Main It Was Very Good,,,,,
,615,Every Aspect Of The Stay Was Top Quality,,,,,
,617,Very Good,,,,,
,618,Your Staff Provide Excellent Service - They Are Friendly And Attentive Whether They Are Cleaning  Serving Food  Working On Reception Or Just Around In The Hotel.  We Would Really Commend You On The Consistency Of Their Excellent Customer Attentiveness.  We Ate In The Zen Garden Restaurant In The Evening - The Food Is Delicious  Well Presented And The Flavours Complement The Main Ingredient.  (Wine Recommendation Good Too!)  Breakfast Was Delicious And A Range That Could Not Fail To Find Something To Suit Every Taste.  We Enjoyed Use Of The Gym  Pool Facilities & My Husband A Massage - I Have Previously Attended With Girlfriends For A Spa Day Hence Taking My Husband For An Anniversary Treat.  We Hope To Return In The Not Too Distant Future - No Excuse Needed Next Time!,,,,,
,619,Peaceful  Relaxing  Chilled Lovely Staff Great Food Too ,,,,,
,620,Good ,,,,,
,621,Nice Hotel And Spa But Doesn't Quite Hit The Higher Marks On Facilities - Hydrotherapy Suite Is Excellent Though Disappointing That If You're Using The Spa Facilities And Treatments There's An Extra Charge,,,,,
,622,Excellent.  We Couldn't Fault Any Aspect Of Our Stay.  The Spa Was Amazing  Food Particularly In The Manor Restaurant Was Outstanding.  Staff Really Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,624,The Food Was Excellent  The Spa Facilities Were O.K Although I Was Disappointed That As A Hotel Guest You Could Only Use The Bare Minimum In The Spa And Not Have Use Of The Other Areas.  The Rooms Were Clean However For The Cost Of The Night Stay I Would Have Expected More Luxurious Updated Room. The Room Itself Was No Better Than A Premier Inn Room That I Could Have Booked For A Fraction Of The Cost. Unfortunately Overall Myself And My Husband Were  Completely Underwhelmed.,,,,,
,625,Relaxing Experience. The Staff Were Very Pleasant And Attentive.,,,,,
,626,Extremely Enjoyable.,,,,,
,627,We Found The Break Very Relaxing. The Hotel And Manor Restaurant Has A Very Relaxing Atmosphere And The Staff Are Very Friendly  Room Was Also Very Comfortable.
The Spa And Treatments Are Always Very Good.,,,,,
,628,Excellent Friendly Welcome By Hotel Staff Which Continued Throughout Our Brief Stay.  Sadly This Was Not Reflected In The Spa Where My Initial Disappointment At Not Being Able To Book A Double Massage Session For Both My Husband And Myself Was Met With A Defensive Attitude And Advising Me That The Spa Had 20 Therapists On And That People Book Months In Advance As If "I Should Know" This Continued Throughout My Massage Which Was Perfunctory With No Effort To Put Me At My Ease  I Was Initially Asked To Remove My Clothes With No Effort To Protect My Modesty With A Towel.  I Felt Uncomfortable Throughout The Massage With The Earlier Disappointment Alluded To Several Times Causing Me Further Embarrassment. At The End Of The Treatment I Was Given No Opportunity To Rest And Recover But Was Rushed To Get Straight Up As Soon As The Massage Was Finished.  Menus Were Not Available To Inform Our Choice For Dinner As They Had Been "Borrowed" By Another Guest.  This Then Entailed Running Around In The Wind And Rain To See The Bistro Menu! A Walk To The Zen Restaurant And Finding The Main Restaurant Menu Via A Member Of Staff.  Initially We Were Told That There Was Not A Table Available In The Zen Restaurant But Reception Staff Did Manage To Fit Us In.  The Meal At The Zen Restaurant Was Delicious And Thus We Began To Relax And Enjoy Our Anniversary Treat Along With The Cocktails In The Bar  The Hotel Staff Again Were Once Again Very Friendly.  In Summary Hotel Staff And Facilities Were Excellent  However Spa Staff And Facilities Were Disappointing Especially As The Spa Had Come So Highly Recommended From Family And Friends. The Problems Encountered Seem To Be Because We Booked Last Minute And Wonder If This Should Be Alluded To On The Booking Site That Some Of The Facilities May Not Be Available Unless Booked Far In Advance.   ,,,,,
,629,Fantastic Staff And Experience As A Whole.

Would Love To Have Had The Piano Music From The Restaurant Continue And Move In To The Bar. This Would Make For A Great Saturday Night Atmosphere. He Was Excellent  And Made The Meal In The Manor All The Better.,,,,,
,630,Relaxing. Really Friendly And Helpful Staff. ,,,,,
,631,Great Service  But As I Would Expect For The Type And Reputation And Cost,,,,,
,633,Lovely Time For A Reasonable Price.,,,,,
,634,Superb Property With Possible The Best Overall Service Of Any Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In,,,,,
,635,Relaxing  Good Food  Excellent Spa,,,,,
,636,Greeting Was Excellent.  As Ever  The Spa Experience Was Outstanding With The Treatments Being Fantastic. The Refurbished Room Was Lovely.   Meal At Blaireau's Was (For The Second Time) Not So Good And I Wouldn't Go There Again.,,,,,
,637,Great Service  Amazing Food  Not Long Enough!,,,,,
,638,Very Relaxing And Comfortable,,,,,
,639,Unfortunately We Didn't Use The Spa. Have Done In The Past . Came With My Daughter On A Special Offer But Was Not Happy With Breakfast There. Would Have Preferred To Have Eaten In Main Restaurant.,,,,,
,640,Just Brilliant. Staff Were Friendly And Welcoming. Everything Was Explained Brilliantly And Professionally. Just Awesome ,,,,,
,641,Fantastic Relaxing Break With Superb Food And Fabulous Spa Treatments And Facilities,,,,,
,643,The Hotel Room  Bar And Service Was Fantastic  As Was The Food On The Manor Restaurant. Hiwever  ,,,,,
,644,Very Relaxing.Staff Excellent.,,,,,
,646,Hydrotherapy Pool Was Wonderful.All Staff Were Very Helpful.,,,,,
,647,Excellent Team Of Staff Helped To Make Our Stay Very Relaxing And Enjoyable.,,,,,
,648,Perfection At The Highest Level ,,,,,
,649,It Was The Perfect Way To Celebrate My Husbands 50Th Birthday! The Most Friendly And Relaxing Hotel We Have Stayed In For A Long Time. ,,,,,
,650,Fantastic Experience As Always. Staff Are Perfect  Friendly And Attentive. The Hotel Is Immaculate (And Always Smells Lovely!). ,,,,,
,652,It Was Very Relaxing Just What We Wanted. Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,653,We Had A Wonderful Time. Staff Were Extremely Helpful And Lots Of Little Extras  Like Room Upgrade  Decorations For My Husbands Birthday And Free Prosseco Made Our Stay Even More Special.,,,,,
,654,Excellent ,,,,,
,655,Fabulous,,,,,
,656,Excellent Staff  A Lovely Building And A Nice Relaxing Break. Experience Let Down By Loud Wedding Guests Which Had A Lot To Drink Shouting And Singing Out Side Our Rooms In The Garden Area And Later At Night In Their Rooms.,,,,,
,657,We Were Very Pleasantly Surprised By The Quality And Ambiance Of The Hotel And  In Particular  By The Helpfulness And Good Humour Of The Staff.  Our Room Was Excellent And Very Quiet.  Although You Offer The 3 Restaurants  Our Experience Of The Blaireau Bistro Was So Good That We Dined There All Three Evenings.  Please Convey Our Thanks To Its Staff.,,,,,
,658,Very Relaxed And Enjoyable.   Pleasant Room With Patio And Access To Lawn.   Good Food.   Very Courteous And Helpful Staff.,,,,,
,660,Room Was Good  Service Great But Eve Meal Dissapointing.,,,,,
,661,A Great Relaxing Break,,,,,
,662,Fantastic,,,,,
,665,Overall A Very Good Experience But Felt Gluten Free Afternoon Tea Fell Well Below The Standard Experienced At Several Other Hotels,,,,,
,666,Very Relaxing But A Little Disappointing.  ,,,,,
,667,Very Relaxing But A Little Disappointing. ,,,,,
,668,Truly Excellent. The Level Of Service And Attention To Detail Was Fantastic. The Quality Of Food In The Main Restaurant Was Also Of The Highest Order As Was The Level Of Service Offered By All Staff. ,,,,,
,669,Lovely Relaxing Weekend. Spa Was Just Wonderful! ,,,,,
,670,Very Enjoyable And Relaxing. The Food Was Excellent And The Staff Totally Professional. ,,,,,
,671,Thought Meals Were Too Expensive  Especially Breakfast Because We Eat So Little.  Hated The Fixed Shower  Spoilt My Stay Like To Be Able To Able To Unhook And Be In Control.,,,,,
,672,The Staff Were Very Helpful And Friendly  Nothing Was Too Much.  Made For A Really Great Experience.,,,,,
,673,What A Fantastic Stay - We Loved Our Stay From Start To Finish.  Our Room Was Spacious And Had A Lovely View Of The Garden. We Liked The Special Touch Of A Balloon And Chocolates In The Room As It Was My Boyfriend's 30Th Birthday. We Had Two Delightful Dinners At Le Blaireau And Zen Garden.  All The Staff Were Extremely Polite And Helpful. The Senspa Was Fantastic - What A Fabulous Way To Spend The Day. Thank You For Making Our Weekend So Memorable.,,,,,
,674,Gorgeous Place  Good Location  Nice Rooms And Good Breakfast.,,,,,
,675,An Absolute Delight We Stayed A Year On From When We Were 
Married There  It Bought Back All Our Fantastic Memories The Food  Room And Spa Were Incredible And Service Was Brilliant Cant Wait To Return ,,,,,
,676,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,677,Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,679,Fantastic. Very Highly Impressed With The Quality Of The Staff And The Hotel As A Whole.,,,,,
,680,Room Nice  Bathroom Shower Curtain Leaked  Breakfast Buffet Slightly Disappointing ,,,,,
,681,Excellent,,,,,
,682,Excellent Food And Customer Service In Le Blaireau  Lovely Room  Beautiful Location.,,,,,
,683,It Was Very Relaxing  The Staff Were All Exceptionally Pleasant And Helpful  Best Mini Break I Have Enjoyed In A Long Time And I Do Travel Regularly  Could Not Fault It. ,,,,,
,684,Had A Lovely Time  Very Relaxing Which Is Why We Went There. I Would Have Preferred Waiter Service For Breakfast Rather Then Buffet. The Thai Restaurant Was Excellent  And So Was The French Bistro. We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Food And The Price Was Reasonable. I Did Think This Bar Had Too Many Steps To Climb  Up And Down To The Changing Rooms. I Have A Bad Hip So This Was Not Good For Me! I Also Think That The Hypo-Therapy Spa Should Be Included If You Stay Overnight ! Treatments Were Expensive.,,,,,
,685,Relaxing Rest  Good Food And Facilities,,,,,
,686,Very Attentive Service  Delicious Food  Stunning Spa.,,,,,
,687,Had An Amazing Wknd And Wa Made Very Welcome And Special  Will Definitely Come Again Couldn't Fault It  My Only Complaint Of The Whole Experience Was When We Ate At The Thai Restaurant  All The Staff Were Great As Was The Food But Unfortunately I Found The Manager Very Rude And Abrupt And Felt Very Embarresed  From The Moment We Sat Down He Seemed To Adopt An Abrupt Manner With Us  We Asked If We Should Pay Cash For Out Lunch And E Said We Could Put It In Our Room So I Have All Details And Signature And We Carried On With Our Spa Day  But When We Came Downstairs To Get Our Treatments E Appeared At The Desk And Accused Us Of Not Paying And Was Demanding Cash  Making Us Feel Like We Were Trying To Pull A Fast One  The Lady At The Spa Reception Was Very Polite And Dealt With It  I Said If Get Cash Or My Card And E Wouldn't Leave My Friends Side Until I Had Returned To The Room And Got My Card  It Was Wry Embarrassing And We Avoided The Restaurant For The Rest Of Our Stay X,,,,,
,688,Lovely Spa Experience  Good Thai Meal. Hotel As Expected  Breakfast Not Up To Expectations.,,,,,
,689,The Stay At The Hotel Was Excellent And The Superior Room With The Access To The Garden Was Superb.
Mike Juszczak Was Exceptionally Helpful And Considerate In Helping Us Find A Suitable Package For Our Stay At Your Hotel,,,,,
,691,Every Single Member Of Staff That We Came Across - From The Handymen To The Front Desk To The Spa Staff - Were Incredibly Friendly And Could Not Do Enough To Help.  Very Impressed!,,,,,
,692,Relaxing Short Stay. Our Second Stay With A Year Apart. Decor A Bit Tired.,,,,,
,693,Very Relaxing Break  Staff Were Excellent  Food Was To A High Standard Although The Cheeseboard Was A Little Smaller Than Expected  ,,,,,
,694,You Gave Us This Excellent Free Stay (Our Third)  To Compensate For Our Previous Visit  Which Fell Well Below Your Previous Standards  Due To Your Hosting Two Weddings On Two Consecutive Days And  Unavailability Of Room  18  Which We Had Booked. This Visit Was In All Ways  Like The Most Enjoyable First Stay We Had With You Staff And Restaurant Friendly And Efficient. Helpful At All Times.  Thank You.

We Don't Use Spas So Therefore Cannot Comment. ,,,,,
,695,Relaxing. However Room 12 Has A Noisy Heater That Disturbed Our Sleep. Other Than That  An Excellent Experience. ,,,,,
,696,Relaxing With Extremely Attentive Staff,,,,,
,697,Very Relaxing And Enjoyable. Courteous And Helpful Staff. Clean And Comfortable Room. Attractive Surroundings. Would Have Liked More Light Snacks/Food Available At The Spa - Finger Sandwiches  Cakes  Biscuits  Fruit As Sometimes Just Need A Bite With A Coffee!,,,,,
,701,Very Nice Location For Out Door Activities.,,,,,
,702,We Were Very Disappointed With The Spa  Having Paid Extra To Use The Full Spa  It Was Not Very Clean  Wet Towels From Previous Guest Not Cleared Away And No Seats To Relax So Once We Has Used The Facilities There Was No Where To Relax. We Were Refunded Our Money At Check Out  As A Regular Spa Visitor To Various Spas I Would Not Feel Happy Recommending This Spa To Friends. ,,,,,
,703,Was Very Nice But The Sen Spa Was Very Over Crowded I Also Noticed A Couple Of Staff Members Which Added To Over Crowding And We Was Very Disappointed With The Lack Of Choice On The Menu In The Manor Restaurant  With It Being A 2 Rosette Standard Restaurant ,,,,,
,705,Great! We Were Really Struck At How Friendly All The Staff Were. All Were So Helpful. It's Very Rare To Get That Level Of Unified Helpfulness And Focus On Customer Service In One Place - From The Concierge To The Chambermaids/People To Reception And Waiters/Waitresses. They Are The People Who Make The Hotel And Spa The Relaxing And Friendly Place It Is. 

The Breakfast Buffet Was Generous And Inviting And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble - Even Our Skinny Iced Lattes That Were Perfectly Made The Way We Like Them. The Room Was Very Clean And Warm. We'll Definitely Be Back. ,,,,,
,706,Loved My Stay Again  Only Little Downside Was The Wifi That Was Either Too Slow Or Not Working At All In Our Room  Which Cause A Little Bit Of Trouble Considering I Needed To Check Work Emails  Etc.,,,,,
,707,The Senspa Was Absolutely Excellent.  Parts Of Careys Manor Are In Need Of Refurbishment,,,,,
,708,Relaxing,,,,,
,712,My Partner And I Are Both Coeliac And I Can Honestly Say That We Have Never Been Treated So Well By A Hotel. We Didn't Have To Remind The Restaurant Staff  They Were Very Knowledgeable Of Our Situation And We Had Some Beautiful Food As A Result. Even Gluten Free Biscuits In The Room! A Fantastic Stay. Wonderful Spa  Wonderful Service. My Only Criticism Is That The Decor Is Starting To Look A Little Tired  But That's A Very Minor Point!,,,,,
,713,A Relaxed Pleasurable Stay,,,,,
,714,Wonderful Spa Facilities  Fantastic Food And Friendly Helpful Staff.,,,,,
,715,Excellent Service.  This Was The Stand Out Feature. Keep It Up. 
Price Wise It Was Pretty Expensive For Us But It Looks Like You Can Command Those Rates. 
I Loved The Spa Facilities. Thought The Gym Staff Were A Bit Less Attentive And Spent More Effort Exercising And Talking To Each Other Than Helping Guests Understand How To Use The Machines. That Was My Only Quibble. ,,,,,
,717,A Lovely Relaxing Place To Stay ,,,,,
,718,The Staff Were Excellent Throughout.,,,,,
,719,We Had Such A Lovely Time At Careys Manor And Our Day In The Senspa However Feel Very Dissapointed That The Free Upgrade We Were Given On The Website Was Removed When Claire Wiltshire From Reservations Called To Confirm Our Booking  She Told Me That The Price Of Dinner  Bed And Breakfast Would Be At The Oakwood Price  When I Said On The Internet It Was Showing The Knightwood Rate  She Asked Me To Send That Over Which I Did. We Then Were Given A Knightwood Room - Such A Shame And Not Sure Why She Needed To Do That.,,,,,
,720,We Were Very Disappointed With The Overall Experience Particularly The Quality And Price Of The Food Served In The Main Restaurant Also The Service In The Bar Was Extremely Slow And No Draught Beer/Lager Offered Just Expensive Bottles And Spirits. We Have Stayed In Some Top Hotels In Britain But This Is Not One Of Them In Our Opinion Considering The Prices Charged We Were Expecting A Very High Standard. How Can You Justify Serving Cheese And Biscuits At £11.50 Which Was Smaller Than A Child's Portion And Would Have Been Cheaper To Have It In Your Bedroom Also The Wine We Had At £22/ Bottle In The Restaurant Was Actually £2 Cheaper If Purchased In The Bar. After Expressing Our Disappointment About Our Stay With Your Front Of House Manager He Gave Us A Refund Which Was Appreciated But We Hope Our Comments Will Be Taken Into Account For Future Reference. 
,,,,,
,722,Very Pleasant.,,,,,
,723,Disappointing I Ahve Emailed Manager Direct Re Concerns ,,,,,
,724,We Have Stayed With You Many Times.   However  I Must Say That On This Occasion You Really Excelled Yourselves.   Excellent Room And Service And Excellent Food (We Ate At Blaireaus). We Very Much Enjoyed The Complimentary Spa You Gave Us.   It Was Unfortunate That We Had To Leave Before We Used The Spa On The Sunday Due To A Death In The Family And We Had To Return Home Immediately.   Nevertheless  We Really Enjoyed Our Stay And Please Be Assured That We Will Visit You Again In The Near Future.

,735,Friendly And Relaxed. Customer Service Was Brilliant From All Staff. Joe The Cleaner Was Exceptionally Polite And Friendly. ,,,,,
,736,We Had A Relaxing 3 Night Break.The Staff At The Hotel And Spa Were All Very Polite Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,739,A Truly Wonderful Hotel With Equally Amazing Attentive Staff. ,,,,,
,740,Restful,,,,,
,742,Excellent Service  Friendly Staff And Amazing Food At The Manor Restaurant.

Fantastic Experience On Every Visit ,,,,,
,743,Great Dinner  Friendly Staff  Clean Room  Lovely Pool. Would Prefer Breakfast To Be Cooked To Order,,,,,
,744,Most Enjoyable Quiet Break.,,,,,
,745,We Wanted To Stay A Second Night But Were Going To Be Charged More Than The First Night. We Also Didn't Complain That The Bath Had Hair In It Not Sure It Was Cleaned Prior To Our Arrival. However The Hotel Is Beautiful Staff Were Wonderful So Very Minor Things Really. Very Nice Breakfast! ,,,,,
,746,The Hotel And Spa Facilities Are Fantastic And The Customer Service Is Excellent. Every Member Of Staff We Met Was Polite  Friendly  Cheerful And Helpful - We Really Couldn't Have Asked For Better!  Well Done!,,,,,
,747,As Always We Had A Great Stay.  Staff Welcoming Us Back  Which Is Really Lovely. The Food Was Great In Both The Manor Restaurant And Thai Restaurant.  Our Room Was Very Comfortable.  We Had Some Great  Days Cycling What More Could We Ask For .,,,,,
,748,A Dream Come True!,,,,,
,749,Very Comfortable And Relaxing And Good Service,,,,,
,750,It Was A Lovely Treat For Myself And My Mum. Beautiful Surroundings And Lovely Spa Experience. Food Felt Overpriced For What Appeared On The Plate. On The Whole Had A Lovely And Relaxing Experience.,,,,,
,751,First Class Hit All The Right Spots Very Friendly,,,,,
,752,All Staff Couldn't Have Been More Friendly And Helpful. Accommodation Was Excellent As Was The Food. Spa We Already Knew Was Excellent And Treatments By My Therapists Lucie And Da Very Good Indeed. Spa Receptionist Particularly Helpful Showing Us Ways To Get From A To B Without Too Much Walking As We Both Have Walking Difficulties. They Would Let Us Ring To Have Doors Opened For A Short Cut Or Use Doors Marked No Entry To Avoid Too Many Stairs.
However There Were A Few Problems That We Encountered.
On Several Occasions No One (Reception  Spa  Room Service  Manor Restaurant) Answered The Phone. 
We Tried To Order An Early Morning Call For 28/5/14 As There Was No Facility To Set Up Our Own In The Room. We Didn't Get It And Were Therefore Almost Late For Breakfast. Restaurant Didn't Answer For Us To Explain Why We Were Running So Late. Also Tried To Contact The Spa To Find Out About Spa Classes - By The Time We Got Hold Of Them We Were Already Too Late For One We Would Probably Have Gone To. It Also Took Ages To Get Someone To Answer To Bring Some More Milk For Morning Coffee In The Room As There Wasn't Enough For The Days We Were There.
Lockers In Spa Changing Room Were Barely Big Enough To Put Your Stuff In  Particularly What You Needed To Hang Onto On The Day Of Departure As You Had Already Checked Out Of The Room.
Surprised There Was No Mini Bar. You Offered To Put One In The Following Day But We Were Only There One Night And Would Be Checking Out By Then.
My Friend Was Unhappy That There Was No Decaffeinated Coffee In The Relaxation Room So If You Wanted Decaff You Had To Pay For It.
I Was Invited To Go To The Relaxation Room After My Treatment On 27/5. There Was No Hot Water  No Green Tea  No Milk For Tea Or Coffee And No Fruit Juice. Hardly Any Tea Or Infusions Left - Can't Speak For The Coffee As I Didn't Want Coffee.There Was Also No Phone To Ask For Any  So In Spite Of Walking Difficulties I Had To Go Down To The Zen Restaurant To Ask For Some.
The Hotel Charged My Credit Card For The Package Rate Before We Checked Out - We Actually Planned To Put It On My Friend's Credit Card. We Hadn't Been Told They Would Do That.
Reception Were Quite Rude When I Went To Ask If We Should Settle Our Bill When We Checked Out Of Our Room Or Pay It When We Were Ready To Leave The Spa Later In The Day. She Was Chatting To Another Guest Who I Had Thought Had Finished And Was Merely Having A Chat. It Was Unintentional And There Was No Need To Be Rude - Didn't See Her Name Badge But This Was 11.00 On Tuesday 28/5..
Without Exception All Other Reception And Spa Staff Were Very Helpful  Although There Was A Mix-Up When They Mislaid My Crutch Because Someone Had Moved It From The Main Reception To The Spa Reception Without Telling Me And None Of The Staff On Duty Knew Where It Was.
There Were No Adult Board Games Such As Scrabble Or Monopoly Available To Borrow  Just A 3D Puzzle  Kids Games And Traditional Wooden Games Such As Chess And Backgammon. We Asked What They Had Because We Were Unable To Play The Dvd's We'd Brought Because Surprisingly There Was No Dvd Player In The Room And You Had Only One In The Entire Hotel That Someone Else Had Borrowed And Were Hanging Onto Until They Checked Out  Which Was After We Had Left.
The Gift Shop Is Amongst The Most Expensive I Have Seen In Any Hotel - I Had Wanted A Little Present For My Daughter But Couldn't Find Anything Affordable. Even Relatively Basic Skin Care Products Such As Body Lotion Were Very Expensive.
We'd Still Come Back And Almost Certainly Will  But On A Few Fronts You Did Fall A Bit Short On Expectations. These Were Mainly On The Hotel Side  Not The Spa (Except For All Those Stairs And Not Many Lifts).  ,,,,,
,755,Quality Of Room And Service Was Good. ,,,,,
,756,Excellent Spa Facilities  Exceptionally Polite  Friendly And Helpful Staff  Particularly On Main And Senspa Reception. Clean And Comfortable Room.,,,,,
,759,Perfect,,,,,
,760,Lovely Visit. Pleasant Hotel But Not Breathtaking.,,,,,
,761,Very Enjoyable . Brilliant Staff ,,,,,
,762,Comfortable Room With Good Facilities.  Lovely Pool. Friendly  Helpful  Courteous Staff.,,,,,
,763,The Staff Were Lovely Especially Justyna!! My Treatment By Vassena Was Excellent But My Indian Head Massage Was Very Poor . I Do Not Remember The Lady Who Did It.,,,,,
,765,We've Stayed Quite A Few Times In Recent Years  Always On Zen Spa Escapes. We Always Find The Service  The Staff  The Food And The Overall Experience Excellent.,,,,,
,766,Very Relaxing And An Enjoyable Experience.,,,,,
,767,From The Moment We Arrived We Were Met With Outstanding Service And Attention To Detail. The Spa Team Delivered Their Customary Exceptional Standards In Dispensing Their Treatment. In Every One Of The Three Excellent Restaurants We Were Warmly Greater And The Team Happily Catered For My Extremely Difficult Dietary Needs  Making Devious Bespoke Dishes That Not Only Accommodated My Needs But Far Exceeded My Expectations  Yum! Only Down Side To Our Stay Was Leaving  But I Look Forward To Returning Again Soon.
,,,,,
,768,Very Nice. Helpful Staff And Lovely Food. ,,,,,
,769,Room & Staff All Polite And Can Not Do Enough For You. Restaurants & Spa I Felt Let The Hotel Down  Therefore Would Not Recomend On That Basis And Would Not Stay Again Which Is A Real Shame.,,,,,
,770,My Mother  Daughter And I Stayed 2 Nights In Rooms That Were Interconnecting. We Thought The Rooms Were Very  Comfortable And Provided Everything We Needed. We Were Offered A Newspaper On Arrival But Reception Didn't Explain We Would Be Charged. I Work In A Private Hospital And All Newspapers Are Complimentary. We Ate In The Bistro And The Service Was Very Slow. The Treatments We Had Booked In The Zenspa Were For The Wrong Time. Otherwise Great Stay!










,,,,,
,771,An Excellent Experience With Superb Service  Good Food And Very Comfortable Room,,,,,
,772,It Was A Fantastic Relaxing Weekend. Brilliant Staff.  ,,,,,
,773,A Pleasure From Start To Finish  A Very Relaxed Environment With Friendly And Helpfull Staff.,,,,,
,774,Brief  Room Fine  Spa Pleasant And Our Problem With An Unwashed Robe Was Taken Seriously. Bar Man Splendid,,,,,
,775,A Comfortable And Relaxing Stay  Looked After By Very Friendly And Helpful Staff,,,,,
,776,Very Peaceful  Staff Pleasant But Found Bar Prices A Bit To Pricey,,,,,
,777,Excellent Throughout- The Only Miss Was That This Was A Short Honeymoon Break After Getting Married Last Week- We Mentioned This On Booking And Check In; A Couple Of Congratulations Would Have Been Perfect,,,,,
,778,Had A Lovely Stay! Staff Are Very Friendly! I Would Like To Ask Tho If We Can Have Our Loyalty Card Back Dated As I Was Never Told About This And Just Come Across It On Your Website. We Have Stayed 3 Times In The Last 6 Weeks And Would Have Liked To Have Been Told About The Loyalty Offer Sooner. ,,,,,
,779,Very Pleasant,,,,,
,780,Wonderful,,,,,
,781,It Was Excellent. Staff Very Professional And Help Ful. ,,,,,
,782,A Pleasant Break In A Comfortable Room. Hotel Staff In Most Cases Gave Excellent Service  The Evening Meal In The Bistro Was Very Good  Breakfast Was Average. 
The Pool And Facilities Were Above Average     ,,,,,
,783,Very Relaxing  Good Food  Comfortable Bed  What More Could You Ask... However  A Guide To Use Of Air Conditioning Would Be Useful  As I Could Not Find It  But That May Of Been Me!,,,,,
,784,Pleasant,,,,,
,785,As Previously Excellent,,,,,
,786,Wonderful Stay With Excellent Facilities  Food And Service ,,,,,
,788,A Wonderful Relaxing Break That Was Much Needed. We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome  Our  Needs Were Met With Efficiency And Care But Not Intrusively. The Staff Could Not Have Been More Helpful. Thank You  For A Wonderful Experience.,,,,,
,789,Great Service And Some Nice Touches That Made The Experience Seem Luxurious.,,,,,
,790,Very Relaxing Great Staff!,,,,,
,792,L Found The Ambience Very Relaxing And Welcoming.  It Was Lovely To Spend Quality Time With My Two Daughters.
My Husband Was Able To Join Us For Evening Dinner And To Stay Over.  We Were Upgraded To A Garden Room Which Was Lovely.  We Will Definitely Visit The Spa Again And Also Stay In The Hotel.,,,,,
,793,Excellent Room And Dining And Breakfast Experience. Staff Friendly And Helpful La Blaireau Disappointing Both For Quality Of Food And Service.,,,,,
,794,All Round Excellent Experience,,,,,
,795,Very Relaxing - The Best Part Of The Weekend Stay Was The 90 Minute Full Body Massage And The Evening Meals At The Thai Restaurant And Manor Restaurant.  The Food At The Manor Restaurant In Paritular  Was Excellent. Whilst I Thoroughly Enjoyed My Stay  I Do Not Feel That £840 For 2 People Spending Just 36 Hours At A 4* Spa/Hotel With One Treatment Each And 2 Evening Meals  Represents Good Value For Money.  ,,,,,
,796,Good,,,,,
,797,Enjoyable,,,,,
,799,Our Experience Was Excellent. The Rooms Were Lovely  Clean And Spacious. The Brasserie Was Lovely. The Only Let Down Seemed To Be The Thai Restaurant  Which We Found Very Expensive For The Quality And Quantity (We've Eaten There Before)  We Were Offered A Buffet Which We Didn't Actually Want And Were Eventually Offered A Sandwich Menu. Thankfully The Spa Was So Lovely So This Didn't Affect Out Day!  ,,,,,
,800,Ideally Situated In Beautiful Surroundings I Found It To Be Very Relaxing. Everyone Was Courteous And Helpful And The Food Was Tasty And Well Cooked And Presented.,,,,,
,801,As We Were Celebrating Our Anniversary We Felt It Was A Very Special Indulgence Befitting The Occasion - Celebrated In Style.,,,,,
,802,This My Third Visit To Your Hotel.I Love Staying Here As It Is A Beautiful Hotel And The Staff Are So Friendly. The Spa Is Fantastic.
My Only Reservation On This Occasion Is The Food At Le Blaireau Restaurant. Being A Creature Of Habit  I Like To Order My Favourite Food  Which Is A Good Steak. Unfortunately  The Steak That I Was Served Was Rather Small And Thin. This Is The Second Occasion That This Has Happened So It Seems A Matter Of Restaurant Policy Rather Than Bad Luck. When You Are Charging Over Twenty Pounds  I Think This Is A Poor Show.Shame  As I Like The Restaurant And Staff But Have Been Put Off From Eating Here Again.,,,,,
,803,We Had A Very Enjoyable Stay And Thought The Attention Received From Everyone We Talked To Was Very Good.  We Had Not Visited The Hotel For Many Years (We Were Married At Carey's Manor In 1998) And Were Impressed With The Obvious Improvements.,,,,,
,804,Very Relaxing  Just What Was Needed!,,,,,
,805,We Had A Lovely Break In A Beautiful Part Of The Country The Hotel Was In An Excellent Location For All We Wanted To See And Do.  The Hotel Staff Were All Very Friendly And Helpful.  ,,,,,
,806,4Th Visit The Same As The Previous 3......Immaculate ,,,,,
,807,Fantastic  Definitely Worth Upgrading To The Hydrotherapy Facilities. 
Lovely Staff  Great Stay. ,,,,,
,808,Fine  But Not Outstanding,,,,,
,810,We Enjoyed Our Stay. We Did Not Use Senspa.,,,,,
,811,Second Time Visiting And Would Still Definitely Return. We Have Now Done The 2 Day Sen Spa Break Twice And Will Continue To Use This Offer In The Future. 
Only Blip Which Was Not Your Fault At All Was The Room Above Us (Room 60) Were Smoking And Kept Dropping Cigarette Ends Into Our Seating Area. They Were Very Noisy And Competely Inconsiderate Of People Around Them. 

Thank You For Another Great Stay,,,,,
,814,Relaxing With Great Care And Attention By All Staff.,,,,,
,817,We Were Pleased With The Booking Process. On Arrival We Were A Bit Confused As To How To Get To Reception From The Carpark - Might Of Been Us But I Suspect Your Signage Could Do With Being Updated. Check In Was Smooth And We Were Happy With The Room. Unfortunately  Our Plans For A Relaxed Quiet Stay Were Torpedoed By The Presence In The Garden Room Area Of A Hen Party Of 13 Who Were Hitting The Booze By 3Pm. The Bride To Be Was In The Room Directly Below Us And They Were All Congregating On Her Patio Area. One Cannot Blame The Hotel For This Of Course And The Good Thing Was As Soon As I Rang Reception To Explain The Situation We Were Immediately Offered Another Room And Given Help To Move. So Full Marks To The Staff  All Of Whom We Found To Be Polite Helpful And Friendly - A Strength Of The Hotel In Our Opinion.  We Dined In The English Restaurant And The Food And Service Were Very Good. We Also Used The Spa Facilities Which We Enjoyed. Overall We Enjoyed Our Stay Very Much And Would Certainly Return In The Future.,,,,,
,818,Our Experience Was A Delight The Food Was Excellent Especially In The Thai  Restaurant   The Staff Where Very Good And Nothing Was To Much Trouble For Them . The Girl In The Thai Restaurant Is Worth A Special Mention She Made My Wife And I Very Welcome And Was Very Attentive   She Was Called Stephy ,,,,,
,819,Very Nice Indeed - But Not Sure It Was That Much Better Than Something That Would Have Cost A Fraction Of The Price To Be Honest.,,,,,
,820,Excellent Exceeded Our Expectations,,,,,
,822,Lovely Break In Lovely Surroundings,,,,,
,823,Felt The Overall Price Charged Was High Given The Corporate Style Of The Hotel And Dining Facility.  We Did Thoroughly Enjoy The Thai Restaurant  Food Was Excellent.   Breakfast In The Main Hotel Was Rather Disappointing Both Choice And Quality.,,,,,
,826,Very Relaxing  Lovely Atmosphere Throughout The Hotel And Spa.  ,,,,,
,827,We Got Married Here In 2004  So Decided To Celebrate Our 10Th Anniversary With You... Wow! So Much Better Than We Remembered  We Certainly Won't Be Leaving It So Long Before Our Next Visit. Spa Area Was Fantastic & Well Laid Out With Space For Everyone To Fell Alone & Special.
Well Done. Keep Up The Excellent Work You & Your Team Are Doing.,,,,,
,828,Great Value For Money ,,,,,
,829,Fantastic Spa With Great Choice Of Rooms & Wonderful Hydrotherapy Pool (Particularly The Bench Seat & 'Bed').
Restaurant Was Super. Delicious Evening Meal & Breakfast.
We Were Celebrating My Husband's 50Th Birthday  So A Special Stay For Us. The Hotel Room Was Fine With Everything We Needed  But Not As Luxurious As Others We've Stayed At & Almost Felt A Little 'Tired' In Decor.
Sadly The Treatments Were Just Too Expensive For Us To Try.,,,,,
,830,I And My ( Late ) Parents Have Stayed Since The 1960Ies And Propse To Continue.,,,,,
,831,Overall Very Nice  Shame There Is No Eating Area Outside  Some Parts Of Hotel Look Abit Tired  Decor   Garden Restaurant  Staff V-Good  Massage By Alice V-Good In Spa.,,,,,
,833,We Felt Well Look After.,,,,,
,834,A Very Well Run Hotel And Spa  With Staff Friendly With Each Other And The Guests. The Thai Food Is Excellent And Authentic. We Also Enjoyed Le Blaireau  And The Manor Breakfasts. The Spa Is Clean  The Sauna And Steam Room Kept Hot Too.,,,,,
,835,Very Enjoyable Experience. All The Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful. The Spa Was One Of The Best We Have Ever Been To. We Used The Gym And Then Went For Lunch In The Thai Restaurant Which Was Very Nice And Lovely To Sit Outside As It Was A Nice Day. The Food In The Monor Restaurant Was Delicious. My Partner Wanted To Watch The Football As The World Cup Was On But The Channel Didn't Work In Our Room So He Was Very Kindly Allowed To Use Another Room That Was Unoccupied. Only Slight Downsides Were My Partner Thought The Scallops Were Too Expensive For What They Were And The Treatments At The Spa Were Very Expensive. ,,,,,
,836,Home From Home!,,,,,
,838,This Was A Perfect Stay. We Loved The Hotel  Leisure Facilities And Dining Experience. First Rate.,,,,,
,839,Magical ,,,,,
,840,Relaxing. Amazing. Great Staff. Great Service. Will Be Back In 3 Weeks!! ,,,,,
,841,Relaxing  Attentive Staff  Lovely Spa,,,,,
,842,It Was Very Welcoming And The Staff Were Delightful.  We Had A Delicious Meal In The Manor Dining Room And Were Completely Surprised By Our Complimentary Drink For Our Anniversary  A Lovely Touch That Meant A Lot.
Any Questions Were Readily Answered Fully And Courteously.  ,,,,,
,843,This Is My 3Rd Visit And As Always  Was Made To Feel Very Welcome.  The Venue Is Beautiful And My Partner And I Just Completely Relaxed  Our Only One Regret Was We Couldn't Stay Longer!,,,,,
,845,I Have Already Emailed The Spa Manager With Full Feedback Both Extremely Positive With Two Negatives. She Has Fully Dealt With This And Overall I Am Very Satisfied. ,,,,,
,846,The Garden Room Was Excellent As Were The Entire Staff And Facilities. We Were Greeted On Arrival Even Before We Got Out Of Our Car. We Eat In The Fine Dining Restaurant And The Bistro And The Food Was Excellent In Both Although The Wine In The Fine Dining Restaurant Was Rather Overpriced. The Only Slight Disappointment Was The "Bain Marie" Hot Food At Breakfast  This Is Never As Good As Freshly Cooked Food. Congratulations For Employing Such Great Helpful Staff.,,,,,
,847,Very Enjoyable.  Helpful  Friendly And Efficient Staff  Excellent Food And Drink  Good Sized Room And Comfortable Bed.,,,,,
,848,Excellent Service From The Staff. Good Size Room With Lovely Patio. Excellent Spa And Leisure Facilities. 
Really Enjoyed It And Will Recommend To Others.,,,,,
,849,Leisure Facilities Are Good But Would Be A Nightmare On A Busy Day. Room Is Nice But Has Some Serious Flaws Such As The Shower. It Is Completely Impractical And Neckbreaking. Not Only Is The Bath So Narrow You Can Barely Stand In It  But The Shower Head Comes At Shoulder Height So Trying To Wash Your Hair Is Impossible. Tv Was Disappointing Small  Bed Was Uncomfortable - Mattress Well Past It's Sell By Date  And Breakfast Was Disappointing. ,,,,,
,850,Excellent Stay  We Felt We Were Individually Looked After. A Very Enjoyable Experience.
The Only Glitch We Encountered Was With Our Original Style Of Booking. For Our Particular Requirements (We Have An Adult Disabled Son And Need A Room Which Will Accommodate Three Adults) It Was Impossible To Book This Arrangement On-Line. 
In Contrast The 'In-House' Booking Service Was Excellent And Could Not Be More Accommodating. On Arrival At The Hotel  The Facilities Promised Matched Our Needs Perfectly (And Beyond)-Even To The Point Of Reserving A Car Parking Space Specifically For Us Adjacent To Our Room-A Very Thoughtful Touch.,,,,,
,851,From The Warm Welcome   Your Wonderful Employees  Great Food   Well A Pointed Bedrooms We Had Two Wonderful Days And We Thank You.  ,,,,,
,852,For A Special Occasion It Was A Great Treat. My Husband Says The Bed Was One Of The Most Comfortable He's Ever Slept In. We Tried The Thai & The Bistro Restaurants  Both Excellent. We Enjoyed The Countryside And Being So Close To Everything. ,,,,,
,853,We Have Been Coming Here For The Last 5 Years And Each Time All The Staff Have Treated Us As Vi P's And Couldn't Do Enough For Us Including The Staff In The Spa. We Are Always Disappointed When It Is Time For Us To Leave And We Start To Arrange Our Next Visit As Soon As We Get Home. Thank You,,,,,
,855,Lovely Room Very Smart Hotel.  We Only Stayed For One Night,,,,,
,858,This Was A Birthday Treat For My Other Half (Which I Get To Enjoy Also) When We Arrived We  Were Told That We Had Been Upgraded :0) This Was A Really Lovely Surprise  Thank You. Everyone Was Really Lovely And Helpful. The Food Was Amazing And Already Can't Wait To Come Back.,,,,,
,859,I Returned To Careys With My Disabled Elderly Mother.  The Experience Was Nice  But I Felt That There Were A Few Cut Backs From Our Usual Stay.  Its Hard To Put A Finger On It But It Felt Different.  I Must Say That The Dining Room Really Does Need Redecorating And A New Carpet.  The Tables And Chairs Are In A Very Poor State.  One Morning At Breakfast I Notice That The Leg Of My Chair Had Come Away From The Seat And Had To Ask For A Different Chair!  The Dining Tables Have Legs That Are Quite Close Together And Do Not Accommodate A Wheelchair  Therefore I Couldn't Get My Mother Close Enough To The Table Without A Pillow Behind Her Back.  ,,,,,
,861,Unfortunately Not As Good As Our First Experience In March 2014. We Were Disappointed With A Couple Of Points Relating To The Overall Sense Of Tranquility And Quality Of Service. Here Is A Short Overview: Positives - Thai Massage Very Good. The Accommodation Was A Lot Cleaner  In Particular The Quiet Room. The Hydrotherapy Suite Was Functioning Well And Had Clearly Been Serviced. The Mind And Body Class Was Excellent. Excellent Evening Meal In The Sen Restaurant. Negatives - No Buffet Breakfast In Sen Restaurant (Due To Low Volume Of Guests). Served Instant Coffee In A Cavitiere. The Cooked Breakfast Tasted Like It Had Been Reheated. Aggressive Sales Pitch For Cosmetic Products Following Sally's Facial Treatment. The Was No Herbal Or Fruit Teas Available In The Quiet Room  Basic Tea Bags Had Been Placed In Twinings Box. The Fruit Juice Option Was Low Quality And Did Not Espouse Healthy Living. The Quality Of Coffee In The Flask Was Extremely Poor And The Hot Water Needs To Be Refreshed On A More Regular Basis. Due To A Servicing Error We Were Served A Salty Coffee In The French Restaurant. During Breakfast In The Sen Restaurant We Had To Endure An Electrical Contractor Undertaking A Service Of The Light Bulbs. The Use Of Mobile Phones Had Definitely Reduced Since Our Last Stay  However  The Overall Ambience Had Declined  With A Lot Of Chatter And Hilarity From Larger Groups. ,,,,,
,862,We Love It Here.,,,,,
,863,Room  Particularly The Bathroom  Was Poor For A 4 Star Hotel. The Hotel Clearly Needs Some Money Pumped Back Into Its Infrastructure. Food Good. Service Good. But The Package Was Diminished By The Accommodation - Room 98 -Specifically Extractor Fan Not Working  Small And Damaged Plastic Basin  Bathroom Door Kept Swinging Open  Etc.,,,,,
,864,A Wonderful Break Away From The Stresses And Strains Of Normal Life. The Spa Offers A Lot Of Added Value  Especially As There Is Plenty There That Is Already Included In The Price Of The Accomodation.,,,,,
,865,Excellent,,,,,
,866,An Enjoyable Experience Set In A Lovely Part Of The New Forest.  The Staff Are Very Friendly And Accommodating  The Food Was Excellent And The Facilities Were Great.,,,,,
,868,The Spa Is Very Nice  But The Breakfast And Lunch Were Very Disappointed. Poor Quality Of Food Not Fresh Made.,,,,,
,869,Staff Were Very Welcoming. The Room Was  A Good Size And Overlooked Delightful Courtyard. Breakfast Was Well Organised And The Food Was Good Quality.,,,,,
,870,Very Relaxing With Amazingly Helpful Staff,,,,,
,872,Lovely Much Needed Family Weekend Break.  ,,,,,
,873,A Lovey Relaxing Weekend,,,,,
,874,It Was A Great Stay - The Service Was Amazing With Everyone We Met Being Extremely Friendly And Welcoming. Nice Personal Touches Such As The Receptionist Asking How The Trip From Edgware Was (Simple Greeting But Very Effective In Making It Personal). 
Spa Is Probably The Best That I've Been To Anywheer In The World And The Staff At The Spa Are Really Wonderful.,,,,,
,875,Thoroughly Enjoyed The Thai Restaurant On The Friday Evening. However  Felt The Hotel Was Tired Looking Since My Last  Visit. The Breakfast Was Truly Appalling As Was The Room In Which It Was Served And When We Complained At Checkout There Was No Offer Of A Deduction To Our Bill.,,,,,
,876,My Husband And I Came For A One Night Stay To Celebrate Father's Day As Our Children Were Away On Their Own Activities.  We Were Impressed With The Quality Of The Hotel In General And The Staff Were Very Friendly.  A Couple Of Minor Pointers  We Made A Request For A Particular Type Of Tea To Have With Our Afternoon Tea.  We Were Aware That Lady Grey Is Not That Popular And Were Quite Happy To Have Breakfast Tea As An Alternative Option.  The Waitress Was Very Accommodating And Went To See If She Could Source The Requested Tea.  It Was Unfortunate Therefore To Hear A Senior Member Of Staff Making Some Comment Along The Lines Of " We Can't Stock Every Type Of Tea And They Will Have To Make To With Breakfast Tea".  To Be Honest It Was Not What Was Said But How It Was Said That Was Disappointing.,,,,,
,877,The Welcome Was Excellent And The Stay Very Enjoyable.  The Breakfast And The Two Restaurants That We Tried Had Good Quality And Tasty Food. Me And My Husband Enjoyed The Massages Greatly.  The Staff Were Always Courteous And Willing To Help.   I Found The Whole Experience Similar To Staying At 5 Star Hotels In The Far East.,,,,,
,879,Very Comfortable And Relaxing.,,,,,
,880,A Lovely Way To Celebrate Our Wedding Anniversary,,,,,
,882,The Hotel Was Clean And Comfortable. We Had Dinner In The French Bistro Which Was Very Nice. The Service At The Spa Was Not As Good As Previous Visits  With Staff Being A Bit Distracted And Talking Amongst Themselves Rather Than Paying Attention To Guests At Times.,,,,,
,883,Nice And Relaxing But For The Money Paid I'd Have Expected Walls That Weren't Paper Thin - I Could Hear Another Guest Snore. Also  Breakfast Was Tasty But Unfortunately Was Only Luke Warm.,,,,,
,884,Very Disappointed  It's Very Dated And Did Not Get A Nice Feel About The Hotel. It's Very Expensive For What You Receive. I Have Been To Much Nicer Hotels That Are Much Cheaper,,,,,
,885,Made Feel Very Welcome  Courteous And Helpfull Staff  Issues Dealt With Quickly (Toilet Flush & Tv Remote Control) Relaxing Stay,,,,,
,886,It Was Comfortable But Underwhelhming.  The Grand Entrance Did Not Match The Rest Of The Feel Of Thr Hotel. Disappointing That The Access To The Spa Which Came With Staying At The Hotel Was Limited. Notice Other Guests On Different Occasions Were Surprised By This Too.  For The Room Rates You Would Expect It To Be Included. Charging An Additional £25 Is A Bit Cheeky.,,,,,
,887,Lovely Location And Facilities  I Did Think Overnight Guests In The Hotel Should Have Complimentary Use Of The Spa Facilities Without Having To Pay An Additional Cost Or At Least Receive A Complimentary Hour Or Two Of The Luxury Spa Facilities If Paying For A Treatment.,,,,,
,888,A Very Relaxing Stay,,,,,
,889,Over All Very Good.
Pillows A Bit Old And Soft.
Bathroom Door Creaks!,,,,,
,890,Although We Only Stayed For 2 Nights  It Felt Like We'd Been Away For A Week! We Were Completely Relaxed After Visiting The Spa And Felt Rejuvenated. We Ate In Le Blaireau And The Zen Garden And They Were Both Simply Excellent  With Faultless Service And Delicious  Freshly Prepared Food. The Staff Are The Best I've Come Across In Any Hotel - And I Used To Work At The Ritz London! We Were Really Quite Sad To Leave And Are Already Planning Our Next Visit!,,,,,
,891,Careys Manor Is A Great Place To Spend A Big Birthday.  The Spa Is Fabulous  Especially The Hydrotherapy Pool.  Wonderful Staff  Great Food.  Very Highly Recommended.  Can't Wait To Return.,,,,,
,892,Made To Feel Special  And Welcomed By Every Staff Member We Met. Spa Was Very Well Kept And We Loved The Location.,,,,,
,895,Very Friendly Staff. Comfortable Rooms. At Our Age We Missed Staircase.,,,,,
,896,Extremley Relaxing. We Were Very Spoilt  Which Is Exactly What We Needed! Nothing Was Too Much Trouble From Any Member Of Staff. Bedroom Aspect Lovely  Very Clean Although Looking A Little Tired Looking.,,,,,
,897,Relaxing Peaceful And Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,898,Excellent Time Lovely Weather More Food Than We Should Eat And All-Round Good Service.,,,,,
,899,Very Friendly  Courteous And Knowledgeable Staff In A Hotel With Well Presented Rooms And Excellent Spa Facilities. ,,,,,
,901,Excellent Quality Of Food   The Room Was Clean And Comfortable   The Over Bath Shower Was Lacking In Flow Most Probably Scaled Up And One Of The Bathroom Lights Was Out . We Stayed In The Manor House And Enjoyed The Ambiance   Car Parking Is A Bit Daunting Could Easily Get Lost . ,,,,,
,902,Relaxing Pleasant Staff,,,,,
,903,Good ,,,,,
,904,Enjoyed It . ,,,,,
,906,Excellent.,,,,,
,907,The Rooms And The Senspa Are Sensational. The Staff Is Extraordinary Friendly. The Food In The Thai Restaurant Is Brilliant. The Only Area For Improvement From My Point Of View Is The Food In The Manor Restaurant (Breakfast And Dinner).,,,,,
,908,Well  Just To Say A Huge Thank You To All The Staff For Making My 21St Birthday One To Remember   The Attention To Detail Was Fabulous And Made Me Feel Very Special.,,,,,
,909,Superb Hotel And Facilities In The Spa.  Staff Are Very Friendly And Accomodating.  The Food In  Zen Garnden Restaurant Is Excellent And The Atmosphere In The Whole Hotel  Spa And Zen Garden Were Very Relaxing - Just What I Needed.,,,,,
,910,Very Pleasant With Excellent Service And Great Quality Food,,,,,
,912,Excellent With All Staff Very Courteous And Attentive.,,,,,
,913,Overall Very Good. Weather Helped!,,,,,
,914,We Have Stayed Many Times And Love The Garden Rooms And The Senspa. The Last Two Times We Came We Felt That The Service Had Dropped Off In The Manor Resteraunt And So We Tried The French Resteraunt This Time And It Was Good But Not As Good As The Manor (When The Waitors Are Attentive). We Had A Few Issues With The Room This Time But These Were Dealt With Straight Away. We Think The Hotel Is Good Value For A Treat Gettaway And Is The Right Side Of Formal Without Being Intimidating. The Staff This Time Were Particulrly Helpful. ,,,,,
,915,The Spa Was Fantastic And Food Excellent  Only Thing  It Would Be Nice If The Main Pool Wasn't So Cold.,,,,,
,918,Excellent All Staff Very Friendly And Helpful The Room No2 Was Superb We Stayed In No 4 Twice Before Food Good Selection Thank Manager For Our Glasses Of Champagne All Round Most Excellent Very Happy Stay Fred Pat Brightmore Oxford ,,,,,
,920,For £258 Per Night B&B I Was Expecting A More Luxurious Hotel Than It Actually Is - Especially When You Look At The Photos On The Website. The Manor Dining Room Is More Reminiscent Of A Conference Room When You See The Carpet And General Décor  The Bar Area Is Dated And Quite Soulless. The Tv Room Off That Was Nice As Was The Main Reception  But These Are The Only Original Features Left  So It Appears. Everything Else Is 1980'S Modern Extension But I Suppose This Is To Be Expected. The Senspa Area Has Also Benefited From Clever Photography On The Website As This Was Also Not Much More Up Market Than My Local Virgin Active. Also  In Other 4 Star Hotels I've Been In  Breakfast Is Cooked To Order And Not A Buffet But I Guess They're Smaller Hotels. We Dined In Your Sister Hotel  The Montagu Arms Which Was Fabulous And That Had A More Luxurious Feel To It All Round. A Major Plus Though Is Your Staff Who Are All Very Professional And Attentive Without Being Over Bearing.,,,,,
,921,A Very Pleasant And Relaxing Stay  With Very Good Staff And Facilities,,,,,
,922,Perfection!,,,,,
,923,Nice. We Had A Good Time And Found All The Staff Really Friendly And Helpful. ,,,,,
,924,Very Relaxing  Good Value,,,,,
,925,A Very Enjoyable Weekend  Great Facilities And Delicious Food.,,,,,
,926,The Hotel Is In A Fantastic Location And The Senspa Is Very Indulging And Well Worth A Visit.  The Rooms Are Very Comfortable And A Good Choice Of Restaurants And Breakfast.,,,,,
,927,Very Relaxing. All Staff Were Incredibly Helpful,,,,,
,929,We Felt Like We'd Been On Holiday For 3 Weeks Rather Than Just 3 Nights! Wonderful Break And Very Relaxing.,,,,,
,930,Not The Best Stay. Bottle Of Preseco Not In Room On First Night As Promised  I Had To Ask Three Different People At Different Times On The Second Day Until Someone Delivered Bottle To Room. I Expected This To Be Dealt With With Only One Request  Not Three.

 Breakfast On The First Morning. Ordered A Vegetarian Breakfast  Which Took Nearly 30Mins To Arrive  Had To Ask Three People Where It Was And Was Assured It Was On It Way. I Had Finished My Breakfast And Sat Waiting In An Emptying Breakfast Room As My Wife Became More Agitated At The Lack Of Her Breakfast And Service.

Despite Booking Over The Phone And 'Paying' For My First Night At The Time  I Was Shocked To See A Full Bill On Check-Out  Which Included The First Night. I Was Informed That This Sometimes Happens And That If I Went Away And Checked My Bank And I Had Been Charged Twice That I Could Call Up And Get A Refund.

Overall  What Was Supposed To Be A Luxurious And Relaxing Break Was Not What I Expected For The Price I Paid I Expected A Much Better Overall Experience.

I Have Had To Put My Wife Off Posting Her Review On Trip-Advisor Until I Have Given You The Chance To Reply To My Concerns.

,931,Good But Overpriced,,,,,
,932,Relaxing  Luxurious  A Great Get-Away,,,,,
,933,Our Stay Was Enjoyable As We Needed A Break At This Time However We Were Slightly Disappointed With The Room View Over A Flat Roof And Air Conditioning Units.,,,,,
,934,I Thought The Senspa Was Lovely. Lots Of Different Rooms And The Treatment Was Nice. 

I Thought The Food Was Very Overpriced - Clearly Microwaved And Not Particulary Helpful Staff. Thai Restaurant,,,,,
,935,Very Relaxing. Excellent Service  Good Food. Good Room.,,,,,
,936,A Very Relaxing And Enjoyable Break! Just What We Needed ,,,,,
,937,Brilliant. Wonderful Staff. Fabulous Room (The Garden Suite) Amazing Food And Facilities. A Total Relaxation Break. Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Your Staff. Taking In A Birthday Present And Leaving It In The Room On Arrival Day. Also Forwarding On A Late Birthday Card. Thank You So Much For Making My Birthday Celebration  Extra Special. ,,,,,
,940,Had An Incident In Our Room - Air Conditioning Leaked Thru A Light Socket Which Presented Not Only An Inconvenience But A Safety Issue (Our Clothing In Our Luggage Was Soaked).
The On Shift Manager Took Care Of Discounting Our Room  But This Still Left Us Disappointed With The Resort/Spa Experience .,,,,,
,941,Fantastic Hotel And Location. Staff Extremely Pleasant  We Had A Great Weekend.,,,,,
,942,Excellent. Staff Were Great  Food Was Fantastic  Room Was 'Okay' But That's Not What We Came For,,,,,
,944,Kind  Supportive  Lovely,,,,,
,945,Very Satisfying. Pleasant Experience Again!,,,,,
,946,Very Nice Very Plesent Very Helpfull,,,,,
,947,Great Relaxing Break,,,,,
,948,The Two Day Stay Was Both Relaxing And Enjoyable In Every Sense  With The Added Benefit Of Such Tranquil Environment/Surroundings.
The Staff Were Very Pleasant And Accommodating  With A 'Can Do Attitude' At All Times.
This Has Been A Pleasant Experience And One That Will Be Remembered And Re-Visited.,,,,,
,949,The Food Was Stunning As Always. The Spa Was Very Relaxing And We Had A Wonderful Weekend.,,,,,
,950,Very Good,,,,,
,951,Amazing. Great  Friendly  Polite & Helpful Staff. Staff In The Manor Resturant Were Excellent. Very Relaxing Stay  Partner Had An Amazing Birthday At Careys Manor. ,,,,,
,952,Very Enjoyable And Relaxing,,,,,
,953,A Wonderful And Relaxing Weekend Away In A Luxurious And Indulgent Setting,,,,,
,954,I Had A Great Experience At Careys Manor  I Brought My Other Half For The Weeekend And It Was Very Relaxing.We Had Treatments Booked In Which Were Both The Best We'd Ever Had And We Go To Spas A Lot.,,,,,
,955,Excellent. Best Hotel Stay Ever. The Team In The Cocktail Bar Made Us Very Welcome And Made My Girlfriends Birthday A Memorable Occasion.,,,,,
,956,The Spa And Hotel Are Perfect But I Do Feel Our Room Was A Little "Tired" And In Need Of A Bit Of Work,,,,,
,957,Overall Very Good  Spa Is Excellent And Thai Food Very Good. Staff Very Pleasant  Breakfast Very Good. Two Issues: The Air Conditioning Cut Out In The Middle Of The Night And The Room Became Very Hot  Our Bags Were Not Collected From The Room As Agreed With Reception When We Checked Out And Were Only Found When The Next Guests Arrived.,,,,,
,958,A Perfect Weekend Following Our Wedding  ,,,,,
,959,I Had Previously Stayed At Careys Manor On My Own And Loved It.  This Time I Returned With My Husband  Who Is Disabled.  Although Staff Assured Me That The Hotel Was Wheelchair-Friendly  I Found It Extremely Difficult Pushing Him Around.  The Steep Ramp To The Restaurant Was Particularly Difficult.  If It Had Not Been For Peter  Who Reserved Us A Parking Space Outside One Of The Entrances  I Would Not Have Managed The Wheelchair On Gravel.  Also  The Room Was Not Ideal- A Step Down To The Garden And No Walk In Shower.  I Could Not Recommend This Hotel For A Disabled Person  But For The Able-Bodied It Is Lovely.  Staff Were So Friendly And Helpful- At Reception And In The Restaurant.  One Morning  When Struggling To Get The Wheelchair Into The Boot Of The Car  A Member Of Staff In A Suit Offered To Help Me. I Have Never Known Such Friendly And Helpful Staff. Peter Helped Us With Our Luggage And Was Particularly Helpful.,,,,,
,960,I Had A Fantastic Weekend At Your Hotel And Spa. The Service  Food And Hydrotherapy Rooms Were Excellent. My Husband And I Had Treatments And While They Were Very Good  I Had A Little Mishap With Mine Where Some Essential Oil Was Accidentally Dripped Up My Nose And Down My Throat Which Was Rather Painful. This Was Followed By An Accident Form Which Was Handled Brilliantly And The Cost Of The Treatment Was Removed From Our Bill When We Mentioned It To The Young Woman Who Checked Us Out. I Will Not Let It Prevent Me From Returning. We Have Already Booked Our Parents In For A Night This Weekend And I Hope To Return Very Soon :-) ,,,,,
,961,We Came At A Busy Time. So Corporate And Private Parties Mixed Straining The Services. So One Of Our Rooms Was Not Ready At 3.10Pm  And Our Maid Knocked On The Door At 11Am Sharp (Very Politely). Room Was Comfortable  And Thanks For De-Caff Options.
Breakfast By The Time We Arrived Was Cold  No Bacon And At£18 Overpriced. So It Was A Functional Corporate Like Atmosphere  Like I Am Used To At Work  Rather Than A Weekend Break Atmosphere. Staff Polite.,,,,,
,962,The Hotel Atmosphere Was Quiet Which Was Lovely And Very Welcome.  The Reception Staff Were Welcoming And Friendly.  Restaurant Service Was Friendly And Efficient Without Being Intrusive.  The Room Was Clean.  I Would Definatey Stay At The Hotel Again And Will Be Happy To Recommend It To Family And Friends.,,,,,
,963,Excellent  Very Friendly And Helpful Staff. Very Attentive And Always Willing To Help. Would Highly Recommend Anyone To Stay Here And Experiance A Hotel With Service As It Should Be With High Standards. ,,,,,
,964,Very Good.  Thoroughly Enjoyed Ourselves.  All The Staff Were Extremely Polite And Helpful. An Asset To Your Hotel.  The Food Was Delicious Too.,,,,,
,965,Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,966,Really Special,,,,,
,967,Fantastic Weekend... Staff Looked After Us And Dealt With A Problem In Our Room Very Quickly,,,,,
,968,Overall We Had A Really Nice Relaxing Break At The Hotel  The Room Was Great And The Swimming Pool Area Was Excellent. The Only Issue We Had Was Whilst Having The Massage Which Was A Gift For My Girlfriends Birthday. They Were Very Friendly Staff But One Of The Masseuse Could Not Stop Coughing. We Both Had The Relaxing Massage In The Same Room For 1 Hour And She Continued To Cough All The Way Through. I Understand That It Wasn't Her Fault And She Was Very Sorry But Maybe She Should Not Have Been Working That Day. My Girlfriend Actually Asked Her About 45 Minutes Into It If She Would Like To Take A Few Minutes Break To Have A Drink Of Water. I Was Reluctant To Complain After As It Was My Girlfriends Birthday And I Didn't Want It To Spoil It  But It Did Make Me A Little Annoyed Considering The Cost And Occasion..  ,,,,,
,969,Hotel Experience Was Excellent. The Room Was Better Than Excellent.,,,,,
,970,Excellent Facilities And Friendly Staff. Would Have Liked To See Some Men's Magazines In The Spa As It Was All Lady's Magazines And Cold Water From The Fountains Or Some Water Coolers In The Spa Area Instead Of The Tepid Water That Comes Out Of The Water Fountains ,,,,,
,971,Unfortunately  We Thought The Hotel Was Tired And Over Priced.,,,,,
,972,Unfortunately  My Wife Was Taken Ill Just As We Arrived  So Was Really Unable To Enjoy Our Shortened Stay. My One Critique Is We Booked Via Trivago/Venere And On The Website It Says You Have A Lift. My Wife Cannot Use Stairs  But With A Lift I Was Not Worried. However  We Learnt That The Lift Is Not For Rooms But The Senspa. Without This Misleading Information  I Would Have Asked For A Ground Floor Room. It Was Eventually Sorted  But It Did Take A While.,,,,,
,973,Everything Was Superb.....The Room....The Breakfast....The Treatment Facilities(For Wife)...But Most Importantly The Staff...All Of Them.,,,,,
,974,Relaxing And All I Could Ask For,,,,,
,976,Beautiful Hotel  Friendly Staff.
Spa Great For Relaxing And Fun
Thai Restaurant Was The Best Meal I've Ever Eaten.
Care And Attention Was Given After We Had Told Them We Were Here For A Birthday Balloons And Chocolates Added A Perfect Extra Touch.,,,,,
,978,Good But Could Be Better,,,,,
,979,Good But Could Have Been Better,,,,,
,980,We Had A Wonderful Stay.  It Could Not Have Been Better.,,,,,
,981,Restful  Everything On Hand  Staff Excellent  Food Excellent,,,,,
,982,Good But Not Exceptional.  Some Minor Issues So Would Not Class As Excellent.,,,,,
,983,Relaxed  Nice Stay,,,,,
,984,Really Enjoyed It And Found The Relaxation I Was Looking For. The Staff Were All Very Helpful  Efficient And Friendly. Food Was Excellent.,,,,,
,985,Great Service And Friendly Staff  Special Mention To The Polish Chap Called Samczek (Erroneous Spelling Likely Here) Who Served Us At Dinner. Super Friendly Top Bloke. I Stayed At The Hotel/Spa 5 Years Ago And The Only Constructive Criticism I Would Say Is That The Pool Area Could Do With A Lick Of Paint And The Chairs Around The Pool Were All Rusty. That However Didn't Distract From Our Enjoyment...See You Next Time!,,,,,
,986,Golf Course Very Poor ,,,,,
,987,Relaxing  Great Spa. Felt Like A Holiday Except That My Room (52) Was Incredibly Noisy! As A Result I Got Very Little Sleep  Which I Really Could Have Used. Tv Next Door And Also Bathroom Very Very Audible. No Answer Between 12.30-2 Ish From
Reception Or Night Porter. As Literature In Room Says Service Only Available Til 22/23 Pm I Didn't Try Again. ,,,,,
,988,Below My Expectations.,,,,,
,989,Awesome. The Staff Could Not Have Been More Helpful  The Facilities Exceeded Expectation And The Food Was Delicious.,,,,,
,991,Hotel & French Resturant Very Good  But Breakfast Was Very Poor  Mainly Due To The Fact That It Was Cold.  

Not A Good Start To The Day.  Very Dissapointinded,,,,,
,992,Relaxing,,,,,
,993,Excellent All Round,,,,,
,994,We Had A Lovely Relaxing Break  However We Ate In The The Blaireau Two Nights Running And The Menu Was Exactly The Same. We Thought The Specials Board Would Have Changed.
We Were Staying In Room 4  Which Was A Bit Noisy.,,,,,
,995,Staff Were Fantastic But We Found The Food Very Disappointing In The Thai & Manor Restaurants.,,,,,
,996,Staff All Very Pleasant As Always But We Found It Very Noisy This Visit.,,,,,
,999,Although We Found The Overall Experience Excellent  The Staff Couldn't Do Enough For You.  We Did Find The Service In The Thai Restaurant Out Of Keeping With The Level Of Service Experienced In The Other Restaurants And Hotel.,,,,,
,1000,Perfect One Night Break To Recharge & Rest!,,,,,
,1001,We Took Advantage Of The £5 Dinner On A Friday Deal And We Weren't Disappointed. ,,,,,
,1002,Overpriced - Misrepresented In The Website. Less Than We Expected.,,,,,
,1003,The Best. ,,,,,
,1004,The Hotel Is Beautiful. We Had A Lovely  Relaxing Time In Tranquil Surroundings. The Staff Were Friendly And Helpful.  ,,,,,
,1005,Lovely Relaxing Experience,,,,,
,1006,Very Enjoyable - But We Had Limited Time To Make Full Use Of The Facilities As We Were Using Our Stay To Break Up The Journey Back To London From Cornwall ,,,,,
,1007,Good Relax Weekend Thank You,,,,,
,1008,Comfortable And Relaxing  With A Fantastic Spa And Excellent Cuisine.,,,,,
,1009,Everything We Expected And More. First Class. ,,,,,
,1010,It Was A Wonderful Relaxing Two Days In An Excellent Hotel With Great Facilities In A Beautiful Setting.,,,,,
,1011,Very Relaxing With Very Good Facilities  Wonderful Food And On The Whole Lovely Service,,,,,
,1013,I Have Stayed With You On Approx A Dozen Previous Occasions - Although Perfectly Good  It Was Probably My Least Good Experience This Time. It's Hard To Put Into Words But Things Felt A Little More Money Oriented Than Previously. Obviously You Have To Balance The Books But In The Process It Felt Like A Bit Of The Love Had Gone Out Of Things - The Reception Area Had Little Knick Knacks On Sale  The Treatment Prices Were Up Etc. Somehow The Level Of 'Magic' I've Felt In The Past Just Wasn't There. Things Were Looking A Little Tatty In Areas Etc. To End On A Positive Though  I Think You've Upgraded The Wi-Fi Which Seemed Much Better Than Normal? Anyway  Sorry To Moan But I Agree Feedback Is Important And We Love Carey's Manor ! ,,,,,
,1014,A Very Restful And Relaxing Three Days. ,,,,,
,1017,A Wonderful Way To Spend Our Anniversary,,,,,
,1018,Overall Very Good  The Staff Were Very Attentive And Helpful. Some Parts Of The Hotel Were Looking A Little Tired And In Need Of A Makeover.,,,,,
,1019,A Very Pleasant Three Night Break.,,,,,
,1020,Meet & Greet At Reception - Good  Bedroom - Good  Mattress Seemed Worn Out/Dip In Mattress  Gym - Ok  Dinner At Le Blaireau - Service And Food Good  Breakfast - Good  Sausages Tasty But The Rest Of The Cooked Breakfast Was Ok For Taste  Pool  Sauna  Steam Room Good But Annoying That Unable To Get A Lounger Around The Pool - Too Many Towels Left Lying Over Loungers Despite Not Being Used  Thai Massage Treatment - Excellent. Hotel Overall - Good. Treatments Excellent.,,,,,
,1021,Pleasant Staff Relaxing Stay,,,,,
,1023,Nice  Comfortable Hotel With Good Sized Rooms And Amenities  Good Breakfast,,,,,
,1024,Treatment In The Spa Was Wonderful Cool Air Con Rooms And Great Therapist The Very Unfortunate Factor In This Was The Whole Spa Pool Relaxing Rooms Were Unbearably Hot Literally Took Your Breathe Away.Thought Needs To Be Given To This  I'm Sure In The Winter It Is Lovely And Cosy But We Were Unable To Use The Facilities We Had Paid For.The French Dining Was Brilliant The Thai  Was Stifling Hot And  Had Loads Of Flying Ants So Going Outside Was Out Of The Question  We Tried.An Disappointing Experience,,,,,
,1028,Relaxed And Peaceful,,,,,
,1029,The Spa Was Excellent And Would Definitely Return As A Day Trip. Quality Of The Rooms Don't Live Up To The Prices. Food And Service In The Manor Restaurant Was Perfect  But Decor Again Not Not A Good Reflection Of The Food (And Personally Think The Waitresses Should Look A Lot Smarter  But I Used To Work In A Restaurant!).
,,,,,
,1030,Very Nice ,,,,,
,1031,Excellent  Especially The Food  The Hospitality And The Gardens. ,,,,,
,1032,The Staff In All Areas Were Efficient And Friendly. The Service In The Restaurants Was Excellent And So Was The Food.  Unfortunately There Was No Air Conditioning Or Fridge In The Bedroom So We Were Unable To Sleep Or  Keep Water Cool.  We Were In Room 86 (Garden Room) Which Overlooked The Delivery Bay Next To The Spa And On Monday And Wednesday Mornings The Noise From Deliveries Started At 5.30 Am.  Hence  We Hardly Had Any Sleep And Left The Manor Feeling Vey Tired.,,,,,
,1034,Very Good Enjoyed Everything,,,,,
,1035,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,1036,Absolutely Fantastic!!,,,,,
,1039,Slightly Disappointing. As Always We Enjoy Our Time At The Spa  But We Were Surprised To Find Our Dietary Requirements Were Not Passed On.,,,,,
,1040,Overall It Is The Staff And The Food That Make This A Four Star The Rooms Could Do With A Soft Refurbishment,,,,,
,1041,Excellent Standard Of Service  As Before.,,,,,
,1042,We Had A Fabulous Stay And Will Certainly Return. I Have Just Done A Tripadvisor As The Hotel Was Outstanding And We Wanted To Share Our Experience With Others.
Please Pass On Our Thanks To All Your Staff Who Contributed In Making Our Stay So Memorable ,,,,,
,1043,Excellent Stay Which Started Off With A Free Upgrade Which Was Greatly Appreciated - In Particular The Too Had Air Conditioning Which For The Very Hot Weather Was Ideal.  The Staff Were Friendly And Helpful - Someone From The Laundry Even Offered To Help When I Had To Change My Flat Tyre In The Car Park - I Didn't Need The Help But The Offer Was Very Kind And Was Not Their Issue To Resolve So Was Above And Beyond.,,,,,
,1044,I Was Very Disappointed With The Standard Of The Rooms Considering That We Were Paying A Premium Price Similar To Top Notch Central London Hotels That I Regularly Attend. The Rooms Were Spartan In Decor And Reeked Of The 1980'S And The Final Nail In The Coffin  No Air Conditioning In This Day And Age Is Unforgivable. Poor Show  Very Disappointed  Won't Be Coming Back I'm Afraid.,,,,,
,1046,Wonderful Relaxing Weekend  Friendly Staff  Lovely Rooms  Amazing Spa  Great Food. By Far The Best Spa I Have Ever Been To.....And I Have Been To A Few!!! ,,,,,
,1047,Relaxing And Very Pleasant,,,,,
,1048,We Only Stayed One Night But It Was Great. Room Was V Good And Staff Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,1049,Both Mine And My Girlfriends Experience At Cares Manor Has To Of Been One Of If Not The Most Amazing   Relaxing   Fantastic Weekends Ever   The Whole Place Is Absolutely Awesome There Is Not And Could Not Be A Single Thing I Would Change   The Staff Are Second To None   There Was A Young Girl By The Name Of Carmen On The Spa Reception Who Deserves A Special Mention As She Went Above And Beyond To Make My Girlfriend And I Feel Very Comfortable   Special   And Like We Were The Only Guests There She Truly Is An Asset To Your Hotel . The Whole  Experience Has Been Fantastic   The Spa And Everything About It   The Food At All Of The Three Restaurants Was Amazing   All The Staff Across The Entire Minor Were Great   Polite   Knew There Jobs Well And Made Our Stay Perfect   We Will Without A Shadow Of A Doubt Be Returning Very Very Soon As This Has Made Us Both Realise That There Is More To Life Than Work Work Hustle Bustle And Shall Be Doing This On A Regular Basis In The Company Of Careys Manor ....
On Behalf Of My Girlfriend And I  I Would Like To Thank The Whole Team At Careys Manor For Making Our Trip Very Special And For Making Us Want To Come Back   Keep Up The Amazing Work And I Can Not Thank You Enough ,,,,,
,1050,Staff Friendly. The Room Had No Air Conditioning And When We Opened The Windows We Kept On Getting Cigarette Smoke From Downstairs. Room 48.

,,,,,
,1051,Excellent,,,,,
,1052,We Booked The Stay As A Treat For My Cousin. The Overall Experience Was Superb  And The Attention To Detail By Your Staff Was Excellent. The Bar Staff Were Outstanding  With A Special Mention For Juan  Who Went The Extra Mile To Make Our Evening A Very Special One. The £5 Friday Deal  Made Paying For Six Of Us Much More Affordable  But There Were No Corners Cut In The Delivery Of Any Of Your Services. Could I Suggest One Thing Though? On Arrival I Was Greeted By A Wonderful Young Lady Who I Can Only Assume Gave Me The Standard Hotel Welcome. However  The Stay Was A Treat For My Cousin  And I Had To Ask Her To Greet Them Without The' Welcome To Your £5 Friday 'Stay/Offer  As I Was Footing Their Bill  And It Did Seem A Little Unusual To Mention The Offer On Arrival. She Was Most Gracious And They Complimented Her On The Warm Welcome They Received. I Have Stayed At Many Hotels With Special Offers Included  However Never Once Have I Been Greeted With The Mention Of The Offer Verbally  Potentially In Front Of Other Guests! Just A Tad Embarrassing I Thought. The Offer Is Very Well Documented In All The Correspondence I Received From You  So I Did Not Feel There Could Have Been Any Misunderstanding With Regard To Outstanding Costs. Please Congratulate All Your Staff  From The Very Amiable Young Man Who Greeted Us After We Parked  The Engaging Reception Staff  Top Class Bar Staff  Very Attentive Waiters  And The Cleaning Staff Who Made The Beautiful Rooms Look So Inviting.  My Cousins Birthday Treat Was Wonderful  And I Have Given You A Very Glowing Report On Trip Advisor As A Thank You. ,,,,,
,1053,At Careys Manor  We Felt Wonderfully Relaxed And Excellently Looked After.  From The Moment We Arrived The Staff Were Attentive And Friendly.  The Senspa Had A Great Range Of Facilities And Indulgent Atmosphere  Which Created A Fabulous Experience.,,,,,
,1054,A Very Relaxing Stay  Made Use Of The Lovely Pool And The Blaireau Restaurant.,,,,,
,1055,Overall  I Was Rather Disappointed With The Hotel. Paying 300+ Per Night Inclusive Of A Food Allowance  I Would Have Expected A Materially Better Time Given The Kind Of Competition At That Price Bracket. On The Plus Side The Food We Ordered From The Menu Was Excellent  Beautifully Cooked / And Tasty But The Actual Selection List Could Be Slightly Better  Particularly The Wine List And At That Price You're Trying To Complete With Good London Restaurants Where It Was A Complete Failure. On The Negative Side The Overall Food Experience Was Appalling -- The Dining Room Is Badly In Need Of Refurbishment -- Just Look At The Ripped Curtains  The Wobbly Lights And The Mdf Wobbly Furniture  The Waitresses Need To Be Far Better Trained -- Asking For Iced Water Apparently Means A Warm Bottle Of Water A Glass Of Ice And Then A Bucket Of Ice -- What's Wrong With Cold Bottles Or Ice In A Jug Of Water???  White Wine Was About 5-10Degrees Too Warm  Not Once Did The Waitresses Serve The Wine Without Asking  The Waste Dishes Were Left Next To Another Diners Table (2 Tables Away From Us) For About 20-30Minutes. On No Account Was This Worthy Of 2 Rosettes. The Spa Was An Intriguing Experience Let Down By Smelly Steam Rooms. The Bedroom Was Fine Except That The A/C In The Room Did Not Work.

For This Price Bracket The Dining Needs To Be Significantly Improved And You Really Need To Refurbish The Restaurant,,,,,
,1056,Almost The Best Service  Attitude & Atmospheres We Have Ever Experienced In A Hotel Anywhere In The World,,,,,
,1057,The Reception Staff Were Extremely Friendly And Our Room Was Spotless. Spa Treatments And Spa Area High Standard. However  One Of The Members Of Bar Staff Was Rude And Left Me Feeling Upset. The Other Problem Was Very Noisy Guests. At Around Midnight We Were Woken By Some Very Loud And Drunk Guests In The Garden Below Our Room (96).  When We Commented About This At Reception We Were Told That Our Room Was A Long Way From The Wedding Reception And So Shouldn't Have Been Disturbed!,,,,,
,1058,Hotel Is Slightly Tired And We Were Very Disappointed With The Bar And In Particular The Bar Staff. In A Four Star Hotel You Expect Table Service And Some Sort Of Complementary Nibbles. We Stayed In The Montagu Arms Hotel On The Saturday Evening And The Difference In Hotel Appearance  Staff And General Service Was Far Superior. ,,,,,
,1061,Just As Expected Good Service. Always Very Clean. All Restaurants Brilliant Service  Lovely Food. Spa Treatments Second To None,,,,,
,1062,Disappointing,,,,,
,1064,I Would Have Ticked The Excellent Box Apart From The 5 Girls/Ladies(!) Who Were In My Party Thought The Senspa Afternoon Fee Was Excessive,,,,,
,1065,Just What We Both Needed.,,,,,
,1066,Excellent. From The Checking In To The Checking Out All The Staff Were Helpful And Friendly. After 2 Weeks Of Organising A Wedding We Just Wanted To Relax And That Is Exactly What We Were Able To Do.,,,,,
,1067,A Very Enjoyable Stay  The Hotel Staff Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,1070,Very Pleasant ,,,,,
,1071,Excellent Relaxing Break,,,,,
,1072,A Very Relaxing Experience  All Staff Were Polite  Friendly And Helpful
Breakfast Was Great  My Only Complaint Is Real Butter Would Be Nicer Along With Hp Sauce. You Pay A Lot Of Money For This And It Would Be Great If You Add This To Your Menu.The Other Menus Were Not To Our Taste.
The Spa Was A Great Experience And We Will Be Coming Back.Thankyou To All Staff On The Day,,,,,
,1073,We Have Been Coming To The Hotel For The Past Three Years And Always Enjoy Our Stay. The Staff Are Always So Helpful And As We Come In A Family Group That Is Great As Far As The Children Are Concerned. We Hope To Visit Later This Year.,,,,,
,1074,Disappointing When Compared To Previous Visit - Spa Was Delightful - A Bit Grubby In Places But Overal Delightful  Room Was Spacious & Well Designed  Staff Were Very Welcoming & Polite However Our Room Was Very Dirty On Closer Inspection. In The Morning I Stepped Out Of Bed Onto 2 Pieces Of Either Glass Or Thick Plastic (Which I Gave To Your Duty Mgr). When I Picked Up The Sharpe Pieces Of Glass / Plastic I Noticed A Brown Piece Of Food On The Floor - Just In Line With The Bed - It Had Been There So Long It Had Stained The Carpet ! My Husband Had Sneezed All Night Long & Thinking It Was A Unusual Pollen In The New Forest I Closed The Large Windows - The Sneezing Continued & In The Morning After A Very Restless Sleep For Both Of Us My Husband Suggested It Was Possibly Dust Related - Not Seeing Any Apparent Dust I Looked Up High & We Discovered The Lamp Shades / Light Bulbs Coated In Thick Dust  It Was Not A Couple Of Weeks Worth - It Was Several Weeks Or Even Months. With The Air From The Window Blowing It Must Of Disturbed The Dust Causing It To Fall Below On Us ! I Have Pictures If You Wish For Them To Be Sent But Your Duty Mgr Did Go To View This (Room 44)  I Don't Think Ours Would Of Been The Only Room. I Appreciate Not Everyone Is Sensitive To Dust Like My Husband - However I Don't Also Think It Is Something I Needed To Point Out Apon Check In. These  Issues Were Raised With Your Duty Manager On 28.07.14 - Approx 11Am And Subsequently Your Operations Mgr Ajit More Has Contact Me Saying If & When We Stay Again We Are To Ask For Him & He Will Ensure We Leave "Smiling" - What Ever That Means !! He Did Not Elaborate On How He Planned To "Make Us Smile" But It Was Clear Than In Order For Us To Be Left Smiling It Would Mean Us Spending More Money At Your Hotel  Something I Felt Was Quite Wrong. After Spending Approx £500 For One Night (Bed  Breakfast  Spa  Champagne & Flowers In The Room On Arrival Treatments  Food  Drinks Etc) We Would Not Be Prepared To Risk Staying Again. This Was Our Anniversary Treat Away From Running Our Business & Our 2 Children - Both Time & Money Are Precious To Us - We Had 26 Hours To Relax & Recharge - We Chose Your Hotel At Which To Do It At & Unfortunately We Wish We Hadn't. I Don't Think It Would Of Been So Bad But Both Senior Members Of Staff That I Have Spoken With Since Have Simply Offered Champagne / Spa Treatments & "To Leave Us Smiling" On Our Next Visit - Assuming We Would Be Prepared To Spend Our Money To Stay Again At Your Hotel. Very Disappointing. ,,,,,
,1075,Superb!  Always Have A Fabulous Time.  Staff Are Always Helpful And Polite And I Come Home Refreshed And Looking Forward To The Next Visit To The Hotel. ,,,,,
,1076,A Great Place To Stay & A Wonderful Experience.,,,,,
,1078,Good Food  Apart From Breakfast Which Was Poor. Service Was At Best Average  Staff Need Training.  Spa Was Very Good.  Room Was Promoted As A Suite  It Wasn't  A Good Sized Room  But No More.  Manor House Restaurant Needs Refreshing  The Bar Area Is Poorly Designed  The Brasserie Was The Best Environment To Eat In. 

Overall The Room Rate Was Too High For The Quality Of The Room  The Hotel Facilities  Apart From The Spa.  Food Prices Were Fine  But The Staff Were Pleasant But Untrained. ,,,,,
,1079,10 Wedding Anniversary  So Wanted Something Special. Used The Hydrotherapy For The Day On Saturday Which Was Lovely. Ate Thai First Night And In The Manor The Second - Both Very Good. Wine List More Comprehensive At Manor. Breakfast Very Good  Food Of Excellent Quality,,,,,
,1080,Relaxing And Well Looked After,,,,,
,1081,A Wonderfully Relaxing Weekend.,,,,,
,1082,My Wife And I Have Visited Carreys Manor Many Times Now And Have Never Had One Thing We Could Fault. Your Customer Service Is Exemplary  Your Facilities Are Perfect  The Rooms Are Always Fantastic  The Food Is Amazing.
We Travel From Oxford To Come To You And Will Not Go To Any Other Spa  Purely Because Yours Is The Best.
Thank You And All Your Staff For Yet Another Unforgettable Stay.

Andy Feeney ,,,,,
,1083,A Lovely Stay  Very Relaxing And Fantastic Service.  We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Facilities And Food.,,,,,
,1084,It’S A Shame  The Web-Site Gives A Great Impression But In Reality It’S Just A Lovely Old Building That Had Motel Style Rooms Bolted On. Overall It Just Feels Worn-Out And Certainly Not Value For The Price Paid Of £249 (Half Board)

Staff Wise; On Arrival Roy And The Waitress In The Manor Restaurant Both Made Us Fell Very Welcome. The Reception Staff Were All Polite With One Exception  When We Returned Late Afternoon To Ask If Our Room Was Ready The Lady In Reception (Wearing A White Blouse  Possibly Polish And In Her Mid 30’S) Was Curt And Very Impolite. In Fact Her Attitude Towards Us Was Disgusting  As If We Were Disturbing Her – It Made Us Wonder That If She’S Unable To Even Be Polite Towards Customers She Really Should Reconsider The Industry She’S Working Within. I’M Sure You Have Many Loyal And Hardworking Staff And That Her Attitude Is Not Representive  But She Is Letting Down The Whole Team When Acting So Selfishly….All We Wanted Was Our Key! Fortunately  In The Morning She Wasn’T There And The Two Girls Serving Were Clearly A Different Breed And Made Us Feel A More Reassured She Was Simply A Bad Egg.
,,,,,
,1085,Relaxing And Fridendly,,,,,
,1086,We Like The Rooms Very Much And Use The Pool  Which We Love. There Is Some Slippage In Standards In The Restaurant.,,,,,
,1088,Very Relaxing  Very Helpful Staff.
,,,,,
,1089,Although We Had A Great Time And Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Break Away We Should Share A Couple Of Issues With You,,,,,
,1090,It Was Really Good  All The Staff Provided Excellent Service. I Felt The Hotel Was A Bit Old Fashioned And Out Of Date  I Prefer Boutique Style But The Zen Restaurant And Spa Were Excellent.,,,,,
,1091,A Really Relaxing Time  With Great Food And Service.,,,,,
,1092,Enjoyable  Relaxed Stay.  We Particularly Appreciated The Support Given To Hosting My Uncle's 80Th Birthday Tea Party In The Garden.  Staff Were Particularly Attentive.  Which Was Much Appreciated. ,,,,,
,1093,Excellent Service From Start To Finish  Lovely Location - Very Central. Amazing Food And Great Room With Balcony.,,,,,
,1094,The Food Was Outstanding - We Ate At Zen Garden And The Manor Restaurant.  The Spa Was Lovely - Small But Very Nice.  The Room Was A Bit Small And The Robes And Towels Smelled A Bit Stale.  ,,,,,
,1095,My Daughter And I Had A Relaxing Enjoyable Experience. ,,,,,
,1096,All The Staff Were Very Welcoming And Made Our Experience As Delightful As Possible. No Problem Was Too Big Or Small And Always Attended To Our Needs Right Away! Our Experience Was Relaxing And Exactly What We Hoped For. ,,,,,
,1097,Staff Were Attentive  Helpful  Room Was Lovely  Food Excellent. ,,,,,
,1098,Very Friendly And Helpful Staff  Excellant Service  Excellant Food And Fantastic Spa Facilities,,,,,
,1099,Our Room Was Very Comfortable And The Air Conditioning A Delight. The Bathroom Was Practical  But A Little Dated And Darkly Lit Compared With Other Hotels We've Stayed In Recently. The Staff  Without Exception Were Helpful  Courteous And Friendly. Le Blaireau Brasserie Was Excellent In All Respects And I Have Posted A Review On Tripadvisor To That Effect. The Spa Pool Was A Real Bonus And Added Greatly To Our Overall Enjoyment.,,,,,
,1100,Generally Very Good With Very Friendly Staff And Good Facilities But With A Few Points For Improvement.,,,,,
,1101,Pleasant Relaxed Stay.   Enjoyable French-Style Food On Le Blaireau.,,,,,
,1102,Blissfully Relaxing  The Staff Were So Welcoming And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble
,,,,,
,1103,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,1104,Fantastic Time Made Wifes Birthday Very Specialt,,,,,
,1105,My Stay Was Pleasant  But No More Than That.  Neither The Hotel Nor The Spa Were Remarkable.  I Will Not Be Returning.,,,,,
,1106,Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,1107,I Had A Lovely Relaxing Time. Was Looked After By Fantastic And Efficient Staff. There Were Several But Particularly Of Note Was Sophie. She Was My First Point Of Contact With A 7Am Call From My Home To Ensure I Could Check In Early - Then When I Arrived She Was On The Front Desk And Treated Me As If I Was Special (Not Just Another Number). Very Friendly And Efficient. So Peaceful A Location And The Food In The Bistro Was Delicious.,,,,,
,1108,Wonderful As Always,,,,,
,1109,Iit Was A Surprise For My Partner And Both Agree That It Was The Best Weekend Away We Have Had! Thank You!,,,,,
,1110,We Both Have A Nice Relaxing Break Everything Was Lovely Staff Food Facility's The Whole Experience,,,,,
,1114,Again  The Whole Stay Was Excellent.  Thank You!,,,,,
,1115,Wonderful! Always Leave Feeling Very Relaxed And Pampered.,,,,,
,1116,Just Lovely! Lovely Room With Doors Out To The Garden And Lovely Breakfast. ,,,,,
,1117,Lovely - Perfect For What We Needed.,,,,,
,1118,Relaxing And Expensive,,,,,
,1119,Hotel Looks Lovely And Is In A Good Location  Just A Few Small Things Let Down Our Experience,,,,,
,1120,Excellent Service  Excellent Food  Excellent Relaxing Spa Experience.,,,,,
,1122,. Bath And Sink Plugs Were Defective. Floors In Spa Area Were Extremely Wet And The Area Wasn't Dried On A Regular Basis. These Are Minor Points And Did Not Affect Our Enjoyment,,,,,
,1123,Classy And Relaxing. ,,,,,
,1125,Love The Spa :-),,,,,
,1126,A Beautiful Stay In Beautiful Surroundings. The Food In The Manor Restaurant On Sunday Evening Was To Die For  Lovely Flavours And Fantastically Cooked And Presented. The Spa Was The Best We've Been Too  And The Staff Polite And Very Attentive. We Really Did Have A Fantastic Stay  Thank You.,,,,,
,1127,Some Minor Niggles  But On The Whole Thoroughly Relaxing. ,,,,,
,1129,Good Overall Experience  A Little Disappointed That My 11 And 14 Year Old Were Not Allowed To Use The Swimming Pool Although We Paid Full Price For Them.  I'd Welcome The Manager's View On This Topic (Full Price For Children But Restricted Facilities Usage  Hardly Seems Fair?).     ,,,,,
,1131,The Overall Stay Was Good  Especially The Food In The Le Blaireau Restaurant  And The Treatments Were Also Very Good.  However  The Reception Staff In The Spa Were Not Helpful And I'd Even Go So Far As To Say They Were Rude On Arrival.,,,,,
,1132,Expensive  Hot And Uninspiring.......,,,,,
,1133,Excellent. Amazing Spa  Lovely Friendly Staff  Beautiful Breakfast.,,,,,
,1134,Excellent Stay. Superb Service Which Was Friendly And Professional As Always.,,,,,
,1135,The Friday Deal Made This Good Value For Money When Combined With The Hydrotherapy Upgrade,,,,,
,1136,Feel Abit Let Down As When We Tried To Enter Our Room We Found It Already Had Guests Staying In It.

Also Then At Our Evening Dinner At Zen Thai  The Waiter Missed One Of The Starters  Then Served Us A Cold Starter With Little Apologies. Also The Table Next To Us Had Similar Complaints. 

When We Tried Using The Spa Hydrotherapy We We're Told There Would Be A £20 Pp Surcharge As We Were In A Different Time Slot-None Off Which Was Explained When Booking.,,,,,
,1137,It Was Good.  My Few Points Are - The Public Areas Now Feel Tired And Dated  Paint Chipped Paper Peeling Etc. The Thai Restaurant Was Not What We Hoped For  The Service Was Slow And The Ambience Not Good  We Wouldn't Recommend This Restaurant.  Blairus Was As Good As Ever Although The Service Was Pretty Poor This Time. The General Service Received Was Great From The Hotel Staff.,,,,,
,1138,Pleasant,,,,,
,1139,Friendly Staff  Superb Hydrotherapy Pools  Not Too Busy  Great Food  Truly Relaxing,,,,,
,1141,Wonderful,,,,,
,1142,Very Relaxing  Friendly :),,,,,
,1144,First Class In Every Respect,,,,,
,1145,Disappointed This Time. Room And Bed Fine But Ensuite Too Small And Cramped. Shower Pressure And Temperature Were Good But The Shower Head Was Not Adjustable Making It Almost Impossible To Not Get Hair (Ladies) Wet. Toilet And Wash Basin Poor Standard.
We Have Had Better Rooms In The Past And Will Be More Selective If We Stay Again.
Breakfast - Food Not Hot Enough. Fried Eggs Not Cooked Enough.
Decor And Carpeting Looking Very Tired Needing Refurb.
Staff Excellent. Blaireau Restaurant Excellent. ,,,,,
,1147,Excellent Welcome And Experience At Check In. Room Was Ok.  Although I Paid £40 For An Upgrade  I Didn't Think It Was Worth It.  The Food And Service In The Brasserie Was Excellent.  I Must Admit I Found The Spa Facilities That We Had Access To Poor.  The Changing Rooms And Pool Area Are Outdated.  When We Asked To Use The Other Pool At The Spa Reception We Were Told That We Had To Pay £20 Each To Enter.  When Paying Almost £420 For 2 Nights Stay I Would Expect To Have Use Of The Full Facilities.  This Was Very Disappointing To Us Which Means It Is Unlikely That We Would Return Again.  We Are Happy To Pay Premium Prices As Long As We Have Use Of Such Facilities.,,,,,
,1149,Friendly Staff With Excellent Customer Service  Great Breakfast And Awesome Hot Stone Massage.,,,,,
,1151,Thought The Restaurants Were Excellent  Who Service Very Good.  The Only Thing I Would Have Wanted Would Have Been A Small Fridge In The Room,,,,,
,1152,Very Attentive Staff,,,,,
,1153,A Very Relaxing And Welcoming Experience. ,,,,,
,1154,A Very Relaxing And Welcoming Experience. ,,,,,
,1156,On Arrival We Were Greeted By A Very Nice Gentleman And Check In Was Quick And Easy. We Were Shown To Our Room And Informed Of What We Should Except From Our Stay. We Booked In For An Evening Session In The Spa Which Was Great. We Had Dinner In The Manor Restaurant And The Food Was Brilliant As Well As The Service. Our Room Was Very Nice And Clean. The Only Thing That We Could Criticise Was The Breakfast  It Was Terrible. It Was Such A Shock Compared To The Dinner The Night Before  The Hash Brown Could Not Have Been More Solid  The Scrambled Egg And Bacon Was Very Over Cooked And The Sausage Was Not Nice Either. We Didn't Say Anything As We Had Such A Nice Time And Didn't Want To Put A Downer On Anything. That Is The Only Feedback I Have  Everything Else Was Exceptional. ,,,,,
,1157,A Medley Of Disjointed Couldn't Care Less  Disinterested  Self Important People Floating Around In Their Own Silos Of Unwarranted Aloofness.,,,,,
,1158,As Ever  A Very Good And Enjoyable Experience,,,,,
,1159,A Hassle Free Relaxing Experience With Attentive And Caring Staff.,,,,,
,1160,Had A Fantastic Time The Staff Were Very Helpful You Should Be Very Proud,,,,,
,1161,Excellent Service And Facilities As Always. Staff On Check In Immediately Recognised That We Had Stayed Before.,,,,,
,1162,Very Nice.  We Had A Small Room But Nicely Fitted Out.  ,,,,,
,1163,There Was A Mix Up With The Booking  Partly My Fault But Also The Carey Booking Agent Should Have Spotted The Issue. Service Was Out Of A Book As Opposed To Genuine 5 Star Natural  Friendly Service. Common Areas And Corridors Looking Very Tired. ,,,,,
,1164,Very Pleasant And The Breakfast Very Good.,,,,,
,1165,Generally Good - Breakfast Service Quite Poor  Orders Were Incorrectly Taken On All Three Mornings? Bar Service Very Poor During The Day  Especially When We Were Sitting Outside In The Gardens  Waited Over 30Mins To Be Served!,,,,,
,1166,Although There Are Many Things We Like About Careys Manor  The Main Draw Is The Exceptionally Friendly And Helpful Staff  All Staff Were Welcoming At All Times And This Made A Difference To Our Stay. We Also Appreciated The '£5 Friday' Deal As It Made The Stay Slightly More Affordable. ,,,,,
,1167,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,1168,I Will Email Seperatly. ,,,,,
,1169,Lovely Hotel  Fantastic Spa ,,,,,
,1170,We Have Been To Carey's Manor Many Many Times Now  It Is One Of Our Most Favourite Places (And We Have Been To A Lot Of Places!) And We Love To Celebrate All Types Of Things Here Because We Just Love It.  I Love Pretty Much Everything About Carey's From The Moment You Walk Into The Lovely Reception Area And Being Shown To Your Room By A Lovely Member Of Staff  To Finding Out Which Room You Have This Time And Always A Surprise Gift  To Going To The Senspa And The Pool Area Etc  With It's Relaxing Area Inside And Out  Where You Can Relax And Totally Unwind  To The Restaurants  Especially The Thai  To Relaxing In The Comfy Sofa's Reading A Magazine And Depending On Weather Maybe By The Log Fire  To The Amazing Breakfast Locally Sourced And Fresh Honeycomb.  There Are Many Special Touches Which Makes Us Come Back Time And Time Again.  This Time The Room Was Especially Hot But We Opened The Windows And Just Let The Fresh Air In All Night.  The Only Thing I Can Find At Fault Were The Fried Eggs In The Morning  Which My Partner Said Were Awful - Not Cooked Properly  But The Manager Said Next Time Let Us Know And We Will Cook Them For You But Was Aware Of This Problem.  Also  I Noticed A Rather Strict Change To The Senspa  And That Felt A Little Monitored!! Overall I Love The Place And As You Will See With The Amount Of Times We Have Come  ,,,,,
,1172,Amazing - We Will Be Back Next Hear For Our Anniversary...,,,,,
,1173,Very Enjoyable And Very Attentive Staff!,,,,,
,1174,Lovely And Relaxing,,,,,
,1175,Lovely Break  Good Facilities And Welcoming Staff,,,,,
,1176,A Wonderful Stay. Dinner At Le Blaireau Restaurant Was Fabulous And Our Waiter  Phil  Was Most Helpful With His Wine And Good Recommendations. 
All The Staff Were So Polite And Helpful  We Felt Truly Spoilt And Are Looking Forward To A Return Visit. ,,,,,
,1177,Bedroom Was Ok  Bed Needs Replacing. Terrible Nights Sleep. 

Bathroom Was Basic But Ok. 

The Spa Was Fantastic And I Highly Enjoyed The Experience. It's In Good Condition And Well Kept. 

The Food Was Ok At Dinner  Standard 2 Rosette. The Pork Main Course Was A Highlight And Delicious But The Mackerel Starter And The Pannacotta Lacked Any Imagination And I Think We're On The Menu For Ease Of Service. 

The Restaurant Needs The Refurb Which I Was Lead To Believe Starts This Year. 

Overal The Service Was Ok And Lacked A Really Friendly Wow Experience. Nobody Went The Extra Mile. 

But All In All  I Still Really Enjoyed Careys Manor And Would Return As Its Good Value For Money And The Spa Is Great. 
,,,,,
,1178,Did Not Have Time To Use The Spa  But The Room  Service And Staff Was All Excellent.
Found Your Web Page When Looking For A Birthday Treat In The New Forest  Did Not Know What To Expect  But Was Not Disappointed. We All Had A Very Relaxing Time  Thank You.,,,,,
,1179,Generally - Very Good

,,,,,
,1180,Very Relaxing  Excellent Customer Service And One Of The Best Full Body Massages I've Ever Had.,,,,,
,1181,Extremely Relaxing.  Beautiful Surroundings And Amazing Food!,,,,,
,1183,On Arrival We Were Met With Michael Who Took Us To Our Room And Showed Us Around The Hotel Which Was Great And From Then On The Stay Was Stress Free  Enjoyable And The Food In The Manor Hotel Amazing. Great Breakfast As Well And The Location Superb,,,,,
,1186,Everything Was Great And Just What Required For A Perfect Mini Break,,,,,
,1188,Excellent  Relaxing - Everything We Hoped It Would Be. Thank You ,,,,,
,1189,The Hotel Was Wonderful. We Were Impressed With The Three Course Meal And Breakfast And Cleanliness Of The Bedroom. We Were Extremely Disappointed With The Spa. We Both Had Treatments And Because So Many People Arriv At The Same Time It Felt Like A Doctors Waiting Room. The Health Forms Were Collected And Spa Staff Stood Around The Desk Looking At Them And What Felt At The Time Like They Were Comparing And Chatting About The Forms Which Made My Husband And I Feel Uncomfortable. My Husband And I Were Fully Dressed So Were Disappointed Not To Be Taken And Put In A Robe For More Comfort And Relaxation Like At Other Spas We Have Been To. The Treatment We Had Were Ok. Good Massage But The Fact We Were Not Taken To A Relaxation Suite To Enjoy Relaxation Afterwards Was Disappointing. We Were Taken Straight Back To The Reception Area And We Then Left. Other Spas Take You To Lay Down And Enjoy The Relaxation Post Massage. We Were Disappointed With The Spa Experience.,,,,,
,1190,It Was Ok  Nothing Special Staff Pushed Past Etc,,,,,
,1191,Fantastic  Loved The Hotel And Spa.
Service Was Amazing From All Staff. Definately Be Back!!,,,,,
,1192,Just What I Needed!,,,,,
,1193, Mixture Of Excellent And Slightly Disappointing,,,,,
,1194,The Spa  Hotel Grounds  And Surrounding Area Were Lovely. Just One Quibble Is That We Were Not Able To Get A Taxi Back To Station After Our Stay. While I Appreciate It's A 10 Minute Walk  If You Have Heavy Bags This Feels A Long Way And As A Good Hotel I Would Expect This Service To Be Available.,,,,,
,1195,Most Relaxing With Very Good Service And Most Attentive Staff,,,,,
,1196,The Hotel Was One Of The Best I Have Stayed At.The Food Was Very Very Good Liked The Three Resturants Staff Was Excellent Very Smart In All Areas It Was Very Nice To See Door Staff Rush Out When It Was Raining To Help My Wife.
Would Be Comimg Back Very Soon With My Family.,,,,,
,1197,Good 4 Star Hotel. Excellent Location. Attentive Front Office Staff. Helpful Concierge. Good Room. ,,,,,
,1198,Very Luxurious And Surprisingly Quiet In The Spa. The Restaurants Were Good With Excellent Service.,,,,,
,1199,The Staff Were Very Friendly And Entusiastic About Their Roles. The Staff In The French Restuarant Were Particularily Good At Relaxing And Welcoming Everyone And Making Sure That Everyone Had A Good Expereince.,,,,,
,1200,A Very Relaxing Stay With Real Comfort And Splendid Service,,,,,
,1201,Good But Not As Good As Last Time Which Was Excellent.  Food Not As Good But To Be Fair To You A Refund Was Made.,,,,,
,1202,We Loved The Spa And The Staff At The Hotel We Very Helpful And Friendly. The Restaurant Meal Was Very Disappointing And We Could Not Recommend It Or Eat There Again. We Did Complain At The Time  So Had The Money Reimbursed And Were Told The Restaurant Was Being Revamped Etc. So Hopefully That Problem Will Be Rectified. ,,,,,
,1203, From Our Arrival And Being Met By Pete Rand  Our  Check In With Emily The  Bar Had Been Set Very High. Than We Learned We Had Been Upgraded For Which We Send You A Huge Thank You. Loved The Room  Breakfast The Next Morning Was Delicious( Poached Eggs On Un-Dyed Smoked Haddock)  And We Found The Staff On Duty At Breakfast To Be  Pleasant Efficient And The Team Seem To Be Run Like Clockwork.... Our Experience Was First Class. Would Like To Come Back And Than Experience  The Spa.  We Had Dinner In The Thai Restaurant And Found  The Food To Be Top Class....As We Come From The Far East And Have Eaten In Many Places In Bangkok And  Often Stayed At  The Famous Boathouse  Hotel On Phuket  Where The Restaurant  Is Known For Its  Thai Cuisine. I Think  Therefore Our Praise For Your Thai  Restaurant  Is Praise Indeed For Your Thai Chef And Team.,,,,,
,1204,We Don`T Know Why Your Hotel As 4 Stars!
The Individual Service (For Example  When We Arrived The Person At The Reception Doesn`T Help At All. She Told Us:" Go Stright To Room Number 069 With All Our Packages.) Addionally Your Hotel Is More For Mass Tourisme. We Love More The Individuality. Be Hones And Show On Your Homepage The Really Ugly Accomodation Houses Behind The The Old And Nive Entrance!,,,,,
,1205,Relaxing And Enjoyable,,,,,
,1208,Very Pleasant Relaxed Atmosphere  Good Variety Of Facilities  Understanding Treatment Of Young Children.,,,,,
,1209,A Pleasant Stay But Not Great Value For Money Compared With Other Similar Hotels I've Stayed In Previously. ,,,,,
,1210,Really Friendly Team  Excellent Hotel  Spa And Surroundings.  ,,,,,
,1212,Excellent Service And Fantastic Spa - Well Done  Carey Manor!,,,,,
,1213,A Luxurious Break Away From The Hustle And Bustle Of Modern Life.,,,,,
,1214,Very Mixed - Greeting And Guided Tour By Peter Excellent. Room As Expected. Dining Experience In Manor Restaurant - Very Poor. Dinner In Zen Restaurant Excellent. One Night Exceptionally Noisy - Disappointing.,,,,,
,1215,Welcome Was Fantastic All Staff Were Welcoming And Friendly It Was A Totally Relaxed Enjoyable Stay,,,,,
,1216,Very Enjoyable As In Previous Times But The Behaviour Of The Wedding Party On Sunday Did Tarnish Our Enjoyment Due To The Bad Language Of The Wedding Guests.   They Were Rude And Insulting To The Staff And Used Bad Language By The Bar.   Felt That The Management Could Have Supported The Bar Staff Better.,,,,,
,1217,We Were A Little Surprised With The Room! This Cost Level Both Myself And My Good Lady Expected More. (Space Maybe A Separate Shower / Non-Rickety Fixtures And Fittings Etc.)
The Main Disappointment Fro Us Was The Bar And The Food In 'The Manor Restaurant'! Upon Arriving At The Bar For A Pre-Dinner Drink We Were Very Surprised That There Was No Bar Menu! (My Good Lady Was Hoping For A Form Of Cocktail Etc.) 
We Moved Through To The Restaurant  (Restaurant Service Was Very Good And Attentive  What You Would Expect With The Level Of Pricing). I Ordered The Sirloin Steak And Asked For Medium - Rare  Yes It Came Quite Overcooked But Its Not The End Of The World  The Problem Was It Was Drenched In Salt! (After Asking And To My Surprise This Apparently Was The Standard!!!)
Also  I Selected A Dessert Wine And Was Bought Bottles Of What They Open! (2 And Not Close To What I Wanted From The Menu)
The Biggest Issue We Had Was At The Bar Afterwards  We Wanted A Couple Of After Dinner Drinks. I Ordered A Port Which The Bar Man Seemed Thrown And Made It Very Obvious He Didn't Know Where One Was In Fact I Wasn't Sure He Knew What It Was! (Lost Confidence At This Point) And Returned To My Wife With It  It Turned Out To Be Wine  I Returned To The Bar Only Then For The Bar To Reject My Suggestion That It Was In-Fact Wine  He Then Got The Bottle To Make His Point But To His Huge Disappointment He Gave Me The Bottle And I Pointed Out That It Said 'Wine' On The Label! In The End He Did Find A Port But To Be Challenged Over Something This Simple And In A Hotel Which Boasts High Values I Find This Incredible)
I'm Not One For Complaining Or Moaning Unless Necessary But Considering The Cost Of Everything I Genuinely Feel Disappointed.
,,,,,
,1218,There Were Some Amazing And Fantastic Bits And Some Areas That We Were Quite Disappointed In For The Level Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,1219,Spa Was Nice  Stayed There For 3 Days And On The Last Day Especially It Was Very Noisy. The Relaxation Area Was Full Of Inconsiderate People Who Very Loudly Chatted And Staff Did Not Do Anything About It  Perhaps They Were Not Even Aware. Treatments Were Nice And Staff Were Generally Helpful. Mind & Body Class Did Not Meet Our Expectations  It Definitely Needs Improving. Food In The Thai Restaurant Was Excellent  Can't Say The Same For The Manor Restaurant. It Is Overpriced And Food Was Not That Great. Finally  The Room We Stayed In Had Smelly Carpets/Curtains Which Was Rather Disappointing Given The Price We Paid.,,,,,
,1220,Excellent. However  My Only Issue Was The Choice Of Pillows Available. There Should Be A Choice Of Soft To Firm Pillows Available In The Room. I'm Sure You Had Some Available  But I Was Too Tired To Call! This Was Literally The Only Downside. Thank You For A Wonderful Stay. ,,,,,
,1221,Fantastic Service  Good Food And Ambience At Dinner  Although Decor Felt Tired And Dated Which Made It Feel Less Special Than I Expected Given The Price.,,,,,
,1222,Very Good,,,,,
,1223,Slightly Disappointed !,,,,,
,1224,We Stayed For 1 Night On Friday Last Week And Was Very Impressed At The Courtesy Collection Service From The Train Station And The Welcome We Received At The Start Of Our Stay. 
I Was A Little Disappointed To Learn That Our 2 Massages Did Not Allow Us To Take Advantage Of The Spa Facilities When They Are At The Top End Price In The Market And The Spa Access Is Another Hefty Charge On Top.  
 Also I Saw In The Room Info That There Was A 10% Discount For Travelling To Your Venue By Public Transport And So Queried This When We Checked Out But Was Told That As We Booked Our Stay As A Package Then We Didn't Qualify. I Would Have Expected This Policy To Have Been In Place Regardless Of The Deal That Had Been Booked And Although I Understand That 10% Of A Package May Be A Little Generous But A Token Amount Could Have Been Offered For Encouraging Guests To Travel By Public Transport As Well As Being Advertised On Your Hotel Information On The Website Rather Than Hidden In The Hotel Room Folder.

Overall Our Stay Was Lovely  And The Staff Were Very Attentive And Welcoming.
Many Thanks

,----------------------,,,,,,
,2,I Had To Change Our Package A Couple Of Times Due To My Wife Falling Pregnant (Changed To Not Have Massages Etc)  Then For Her To Mis-Carry And Therefore She Was Allowed To Have A Massage Again. The Staff Were Very Understanding And Accomodating When I Phoned Up.,,,,,
,3,The Email Correspondence Prior To My Arrival Was Good And Communicated Well What Other Services The Hotel Could Provide. On Arrival The Concierge Was Impressive. Genuine  Very Professional  Well-Presented And Projected A High Standard Of A Pending Experience.  Again Once Into The Reception The Wood Floor  Fireplace And Staircase Suggested And Oldie World New Forest Experience. Sadly There It Ended.    ,,,,,
,5,Main Reception Area Is Very Nice. I Parked In The Back Carpark And Came Through The Hotel To Reception Past Senspa. Decor Does Look A Bit Dated!,,,,,
,7,If The Spa Is Not Available It Must Be Made More Obvious To Guests  Prior To Arrival - We Were Notified In Small Print In An Attachment To A Second Confirmation Email  Which We Didn't Notice. So Upset When We Found Out!,,,,,
,9,Great Friendly Service In Booking,,,,,
,11,I Was Not Made Aware That The Spa Sessions Could Be Booked As A Part Day So I Did Not Get Value For Money As We Had Paid For A Full Day.,,,,,
,12,Signage About The Parking At The Rear Could Be Made A Little Clearer As I Noticed We Were Not The Only Ones To Drive In A Big Circle Round The Front Of The House Before Realising That The Main Parking Is At The Rear.,,,,,
,13,It Must Be Made Clearer To Guests Prior To Arrival If The Spa Is Going To Be Full. The Tiny Little Notification In An Attachment Is Really A Poor Way Of Doing This. The Receptionist Made Me Feel Very Stupid For Missing It  But When I Checked Back Through The Emails  It Really Wasn't Noticeable.,,,,,
,14,Lauren Has Been An Excellent Liaison For Our Conference  Warm And Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,
,16, Booking Direct Was Easy And The Receptionist Very Helpful.,,,,,
,17,Very Easy Check In  Welcome Drink Offered On Arrival. Much Needed After A Long Drive. Charlotte At The Check In Desk Was Very Friendly And Helpful. I Can't Remember The Name Of The Man That Showed Us Our Room Bit He Was Very Helpful And Knowledgeable. He Went And Got Our Bags And Moved Our Car Which We Weren't Expecting. This Was A Surprise For My Husband So I Was Sending Alot Of Emails About Our Stay.  Some Called Joyelle Was Very Helpful And Quick To Respond To Any Questions I Had. Excellent Service ,,,,,
,23,I Love The Fact You Offer Transport To The Station.,,,,,
,25,We Have Stayed At Many 4 And 5* Hotels And I Can Safely Say That The Arrival And Contact With Staff Was Better Than Most ,,,,,
,27,Web Site A Bit Confusing And Difficult To Work Out What Was On Offer In Terms Of Treatments At The Senspa. Ended Up Phoning To Book Our Treatments,,,,,
,28,As Promised When Booking An Email Confirmation Arrived Along With An Itinerary. When I Emailed With A Query  I Received A Prompt Response. The Day Before We Received A Phone Call Enquiring Whether We Would Like A Late Checkout.,,,,,
,30,The Reception Staff Were Very Helpful And The Restaurant Staff Were Great Too. The Manager Dealt With Our Complaint Regarding Teh Steak In A Very Good Manner So We Did Not Leave The Restaurant With A Bitter Taste In Our Mouths Regarding The Poor Food Quality,,,,,
,32,I Had Sent A E Mail Enquiry Through To General Reservations And Did Not Get A Reply Within 24Hr Which Prompted Me To Telephone.The Call Though Was Dealt With Very Efficiently.,,,,,
,34,I Should Not Expect To Wait 20+ Minutes To Check In.,,,,,
,36,Very Helpful Particularly When I Wished To Change Massage Booking ,,,,,
,37,Ok,,,,,
,39,Was Ok - Although When I Moved The Stay By 24 Hours It Transpired That All The Treatments Had Been Booked For The Wrong Day So Thank God We Moved It And Checked  Would Have Been A Disaster. Should Have Been Picked Up By You - Who Comes On One Day  Stays Overnight  Has Breakfast Then Hangs Around All Day For Treatments Ending At 5.30Pm? Friendly Enough Though.,,,,,
,41,Everybody We Came Into Contact With Was Excellent.  It Was Very Nice To Be Offered A Glass Of Warm Punch By Your Concierge Before Being Shown To Our Room,,,,,
,43,Very Helpful At Initial Booking  And On Following Enquiry.  Impressed To Be Met At The Car And Guided To Reception. Clear And Polite Information Provided By Porter Taking Luggage To Room. Very Surprised To Find Balloon And Chocolates In Room As Not Requested  So Made Thought And Provision Doubly Appreciated,,,,,
,46,Very Welcoming. Very Nice To Be Met At The Front Door  Car Parked And Luggage Brought Up To Room After Check In. And To Be Personally Shown Around The Whole Hotel. A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,47,N/A,,,,,
,52,Great Concierge Service  Was Shown Around Which Was Helpful As I Have Never Stayed Before. Everything Explained In Detail  Didn't Just Have To Rely On The Red Book In Room. When Checking Out  Receptionist Was A Little Blunt  I Greeted Her And Asked To Settle My Account  Her Response Was  Well  Room Number!- No Hello  Morning  Can I Help You  Just Abrupt. ,,,,,
,53,Pre Arrival Was Fine  However On Arrival The Lady On Reception Speak Very Little English,,,,,
,55,All Very Painless,,,,,
,57,Mike Who Parked The Car And Attended To Our Bags Was Extremely Helpful,,,,,
,59,Were Remembered By Hotel Reception Staff - A Lovely Welcome,,,,,
,61,Most Of The Staff Where Very Nice  But 1 Of The Young Bar  Staff Was Abrupt  And Not Helpful,,,,,
,62,Loved The Way Spa And Reception Communicated So We Didn't Need To Wander Through Hotel To Get Our Key! ,,,,,
,66,I Have Always Had A Very Positive Booking Experience  Both Face To Face And Over The Phone.,,,,,
,67,Very Good And Welcomed By Thomas :-),,,,,
,68,All The Staff Were Very Welcoming.,,,,,
,70,I Particularly Liked The Way The Spa And Reception Communicated To Get Our Keys Dropped To Spa Reception- Nice Touch!,,,,,
,71,Decoration In Hallways  And Dining Room Of The Namer Restaurant Looked A Little Tired  The Rest Of It Was Amazing. Beautiful. Room A Beautiful Spa  Beautiful Thai Restaurant,,,,,
,72,Spa Was Slightly Unorganised. ,,,,,
,73,I Was Made To Feel Really Special When I Arrived Which Lived Up To My Expectations Following Such A Pleasant Booking Experience.,,,,,
,77,It Was A Nice Arrival But The Receptionist Nearly Spoilt Part Of The Surprise Of The Weekend By Wishing My Wife Happy Birthday When It Was Actually Her Friends Birthday Who Was Yet To Arrive. My Wife Didn't Know This And I Was Forced To Spoil Some Of The Weekend Surprise.   In Addition Some People Were Offered Drinks When Checked In But We Were Not. Concierge Very Friendly And Helpful,,,,,
,79,See Email ,,,,,
,82,Generally We Love Staying At The Hotel And The Staff Are Great But A Couple Of Comments: - There Was No-One To Welcome Us When We Arrived Apart From The Girl On Reception. And No-One Mentioned The Hot Mulled Drink That Was On The Side Awaiting Guests. Our Friends Pointed It Out To Us Later That Evening. It Would Have Been V Welcome When We Stepped Through The Front Door On Arrival.  In The Past The Female Restaurant Manager Taking The Food Orders In The Manor Restaurant Has Been Quite Frosty And Stressed. She Was A Little Better This Time But She Made No Effort To Engage With Us. She Doesn't Do The Restaurant Any Favours In Our Opinion.  Terry Was Great As Usual And The Food In The Manor Restaurant Was Good -  We Will Be Back. ,,,,,
,83,Don't Like The New Building That We Had To Walk Through From Car Park. Started To Panic That We Had Made A Mistake  But Felt Reassured When Walked Into The Old Part.,,,,,
,89,The Curtain In Our Room 76 Is Damaged. The Overall Decor In Rooms Is Nice But The Hallways Are Somewhat Dated. The New Lounge Is Really Lovely.!,,,,,
,92,The Staff Are Very Good  No Problems At All. Design And Interior Decoration Is A Bit Hit And Miss; The Oakwood Garden Rooms Have Been Decorated Perfectly  But We Feel The Majority Of The Hotel Decoration Could Only Be Appreciated By Those Of The 50+ Age Range. Atmosphere Good  And Always Friendly.,,,,,
,93,Other Than The Issue I Have Already Explained With Our Bill In The Restaurant  The Staff Were Very Friendly And Processional - Especially In The Hotel And Manor Restaurant.  I Would Like To Especially Mention The Gentleman In The Manor Restaurant That Seemed To Be The Manager - He Even Remembered Our Room Number In The Morning!,,,,,
,94,Phoned To Change Treatments For The Spa  On Arrival There Was A Mix Up And 2 Treatments Were Booked On The Same Day  One Of Which Would Have Clashed With Lunch. However It Was Sorted Out And I Did Not Miss Out As I Feared I Would As I Was Told There Were No Spaces On Our Second Day.,,,,,
,95,Everything I Specified When Booking Was Ready On Arrival And Reception Were Aware,,,,,
,96,Possibly Some Fruit/Chocolate En Suite,,,,,
,97,Reception Staff Very Friendly And Welcoming,,,,,
,98,No  It Was Good.,,,,,
,99,No Hanging About  Super Speedy Helpful Staff. ,,,,,
,103,Very Efficient. Was Offered Upgrade Due To Xmas Party.,,,,,
,104,Went Straight To Spa At 13 00 Hours As Room Was Not Ready.(We Were Advised 15.00 Was Check In Time On Booking). Went To Zen Restaurant For A Cup Of Tea But The Staff Seemed S Bit Confused With Our Requirement. We Did Not Know That Tea Was Complimentary With Spa Visit.,,,,,
,105,Having Checked In And Presented A Voucher  Previously Advised When Making The Booking  I Was Disappointed That At Check Out The Voucher Value Had Been Ignored Necessitating A Hunt For The Voucher And The Correction Being Made.,,,,,
,106,The Staff Were Consummate Professionals. One Of The Best Experiences I Have Ever Had... ...And I've Stayed In Some Very Nice Hotels In My Time!,,,,,
,108,Interior Decoration Lovely Apart From Manor Dining Room (This Is A Comment From My Last Stay There Which Was In June - It May Have Been Improved Since?) Which Spoiled The Lovely Food. ,,,,,
,109,No All Excellent,,,,,
,112,Being Welcomed By The Staff Warmly Made Us Feel Cared For And Looked After And The Concierge Was Very Helpful With Hotel Information And General Information Too.,,,,,
,113,An Option Of  A Posted Confirmation Should Be Offered   I Had Trouble Downloading The Confirmation And Called Three Times. Had It Sent 3 Different Ways And Still Could Not See It.,,,,,
,119,Very Helpful When Making The Reservation. ,,,,,
,121,We Could Tell The Decor Had Been Updated Which Brightened Up The Hotel And Rooms.  ,,,,,
,122,We Would Like To Have Been Warned About The Christmas Parties,,,,,
,123,Good Overall,,,,,
,127,All Round Good,,,,,
,132,When Booking On Line I Had A Few Problems With My I Pad. I Called  For Help And All My Problems Were Amended Immediately By Very Helpful Staff. I Was Kept Up To Date With E Mails And Itinerary Information. Collin Was Charming As Ever And Very Helpful. ,,,,,
,134,There Was A Bit Of A Queue To Get Checked In On Arrival. Even Longer Wait When Checking Out At 11Am When For A While Only One Person Was On Reception. A Second Person Did Come On After Several Minutes. ,,,,,
,139,It Was Great To Find That We Had A Room Upgrade,,,,,
,140,Everything Was Just Right,,,,,
,143,No,,,,,
,149,Excellent. Very Friendly But Relaxed,,,,,
,152,From My Very First Contact  Via The Hotel Website  I Have Nothing But Praise For The Entire Team.  Thank You.,,,,,
,154,The Reservation Staff  In Particular Dawn Brand  Were Very Efficient  Knowledgeable And Helpful When First Making The Booking And When We Made Particular Requests.,,,,,
,155,I Especially Appreciate Being Met At The Station.,,,,,
,159,Peter Is Amazing And So Is Charlotte On Reception.   They Remember Us Every Time  Call Us By Our Name Without Checking First And Always Give Us A Wonderful Welcome.,,,,,
,160,Maybe I Got The Signpost Wrong But As I Came In I First Saw A Sign To 'Additional Parking' So I Didn't Follow That; Instead I Headed For Arrivals. I Had No Intention Of Stopping  Checking In And Parking As Had Little Luggage. Result Was I Did A Big Loop And Ended Up In The 'Additional Parking Area' That I Initially Avoided. My Fault  Or Strange Signage....,,,,,
,163,No.It Was Very Efficient And Welcoming Especially As Our Journey Had Been Problematic (Delayed Due To The Storm).,,,,,
,164,Everything Ran Smoothly,,,,,
,165,The Warmth Of The Welcome And The Continuing Attentiveness Of The Entire Staff Was Noted Throughout The Stay.,,,,,
,169,The Christmas Ambience  Was Lacking In Some Of The Areas  Ie Passageways Etc. ,,,,,
,174,A Wonderful Start To The Christmas Break - Very Personal,,,,,
,176,Overall Excellent. .... ,,,,,
,183,With Regards To Booking The Break  I Did Have To Phone Three Times After The Initial Phone Call To Obtains Confirmation Email. Twice I Tried To Correct The Email Address  Before Eventually A Second Address To Someone I Has Not Spoken To Before Which Then Worked.  Other Than This  Everything Was Great.,,,,,
,184,No,,,,,
,185,No  All Was Excellent,,,,,
,186,Perfect.,,,,,
,187,The Staff We Came Into Contact With Were A Credit To The Hotel And Could Not Do Enough To Help.  We Were Very Impressed With The Standard.,,,,,
,189,Very Professional But Also Friendly. We Were Made Completely At Ease Immediately.,,,,,
,190,No,,,,,
,191,Faultless,,,,,
,192,Had To Wait In Queue  But Staff Friendly,,,,,
,193,Have Said It All,,,,,
,194,If You Offer A 10% Discount For Guests Who Arrive By Train  You Should Ask Guests At Check In To Show Proof And Then Make A Note Of It In The Final Bill Otherwise It's Just A Marketing Scam,,,,,
,198,We Had Our Car Parked  Luggage Taken To Our Room Which Was A Lovely Touch And Made Us Feel Very Welcome.,,,,,
,201,No,,,,,
,203,Superb !,,,,,
,204,The Gentleman Who Showed Us To Our Room And Parked Our Car Was Extremely Helpful,,,,,
,213,No  Everything Was Fine,,,,,
,215,No,,,,,
,216,It Still Makes Me Smile To Arrive In A "Ordinary Vehicle" And Have It Parked. You Feel Special From That Moment On,,,,,
,217,We Were Shown To Our Room By A Very Personable Porter Named Peter (I Think)  And He Was Charming   Knowledgeable And Friendly.  A Lovely Service To Offer Guests.  ,,,,,
,219,The Website Doesnt Work Properly To Book Spa Breaks  When You Try It Just Tries To Book You Into Hotel For Night At Regular Rate,,,,,
,221,Staff Are Good At Encouraging A Friendly Relaxed Atmosphere To Encourage To Mix  Meet And Make New Friends. Future Ideas! A Class/Demonstration/Talk For 1 Hour. Changed Every Month. A Simple Art Class/One Technique. A Talk/Pictures On Local Must Do/See. A Demonstration On How To Make Something Beautiful/Simple. A Local Pre - Dinner Choir Encompassing Anyone To Join In. Etc. Etc...   ( And Giving Local Groups/ People An Hours's Work Or So.  Many Ideas -  Each Different One Advertised As Available On The Agenda. Before Arriving.,,,,,
,222,When Booking By Phone Dawn Was Very Friendly And Helpful And She Also Assisted When I Called To Enquire About Local Hairdressing Facilities. Check In Was Quick And Easy And Our Car Was Parked For Us Which Was Handy As The Weather Was So Bad.,,,,,
,223,Relationship Between Hotel & Spa Was A Bit Confusing,,,,,
,225,No Were Very Happy,,,,,
,226,No,,,,,
,228,No!,,,,,
,233,Lovely To Have Remebered We Had Been Before @ Were Given Room Upgrade.,,,,,
,234,It May Sound Strange But Reception Always Smells Lovely! ,,,,,
,236,The Internet Said No Vacancies But I Was Able To Book By Telephone,,,,,
,238,Our Room Had To Be Changed Via Telephone Before Arriving And The Lady Who Called Us Made A Little More Fuss About Things Than Necessary. A 12Yr Old Child Does Not Require The Facilities That Perhaps A 5Yr Old May And Therefore Worrying About Baby Monitors Was Really Not High On Our List Of Priorities!!,,,,,
,242,Arrival And Check In Went Well. ,,,,,
,244,The Girl At The Reception Desk Remembered Me And Was Very Friendly Which Was Welcoming,,,,,
,246,Tone Down The Strength Of The Air Freshner Or Fragrance In The Reception Area.,,,,,

,248,The Gentlemen In The Foyer Are Charming And Very Helpful,,,,,
,249,Just Excellent,,,,,
,251,I Had Previously Emailed The Hotel With Several Questions Which Were Replied To On The Very Same Day.  When We Arrived A Very Attentive Young Gentlemen Gave Us A Guided Tour Of The Hotel & Spa Before Showing Us Around Our Room  Excellent. ,,,,,
,252,We Were Greeted On Arrival By Peter  Who After Checking In Showed Us Around The Hotel And Spa. He Was Brilliant. Very Patient  Polite And Charming  And Made Us Feel Relaxed From The Start. ,,,,,
,256,Far Too Slow. One Person On Reception. We Were Delayed By Traffic And We Really Hoped For A Speedy Check-In To Allow Us Some Long Pool Time Before Dinner. No Such Luck,,,,,
,258,Well Looked After By Everyone.,,,,,
,268,More Advice Regarding The Most Appropriate Break Option Would Have Been Helpful. The Website Is Complicated To Understand All The Options And Slow To Load Due To The Extensive Images.,,,,,
,272,We Were 4 Couples Arriving Separately For A Birthday Celebration  Everyone Except Us Got Offered A Welcome Drink  There Was Not Even A Hint Of It For Us.,,,,,
,280,We Had To Cancel Our Original Visit In Early Dec So Had To Rebook Which We Did Over The Phone And Staff Were Very Helpful With This.,,,,,
,282,Booking And Follow Up Contact Was Friendly And Informative. On Arrival We Were Met By Christopher Who Guided Us To The Most Convenient Parking To Our Room  Took Our Cases To Our Room And Returned The Car Keys To The Sen Spa Reception As We Were Early For Booking In.,,,,,
,283,All Telephone Contact Was Very Friendly  Helpful And Welcoming  Which Was In Stark Contrast To Contact With Other Hotels.  All Staff On Arrival Were Also Extremely Polite And Welcoming. ,,,,,
,284,We Had To Initially Cancel Our Original Booking And The Staff Were So Helpful And Said They Would Hold Our Deposit For 12 Months Which I Thought Was Amazing. I Phoned To Rebook And The Staff Could Not Have Been More Helpful. I Had Queries Re Treatments At The Sen Spa And Was Phoned Back Directly.  Check In Was Swift And Efficient And Having My Car Parked Was A Nice Touch.,,,,,
,285,No,,,,,
,290,No Every Thing Was Fine  No Surprises.,,,,,
,303,No - Staff Were Excellent,,,,,
,304,None,,,,,
,308,Very Welcoming And Professionsl,,,,,
,309,Heather Was Very Good When Making The Booking,,,,,
,310,We Very Much Appreciated The Concern And Efforts Made After Our Last Visit  When We Were Disturbed By A Corporate Group Of Guests. The Upgrade And Reduction In Accommodation Were Gladly Received.We Were Particularly Impressed By The Hand Written Note And Chocolates Left For Us In Our Room By Thomas Wishing Us A Pleasant Stay. We Has A Wonderful Visit With You  And Hope To Visit Again Soon. Thank You For Valuing Us And Maintaining Your Very Good Reputation.,,,,,
,313,Everything Was Efficient! Booking By Phone Was Informative  Relaxed And Helpful. Very Impressed With The Level Of Staff Service! ,,,,,
,318,Shame About The View As You Arrive In The Car Park And Come Through The Back Entrance (As We Didn't Know To Expect A Porter To Meet Us At The Front)!,,,,,
,331,The Only Member Of Staff Who Was Polite To Us Was Peter  He Took Us To Our Room The Moment We Arrived.. I Will Certenly Will Not Be Recommending The Carey's Manor To My Friends As I Was So Let Down:-((... I'm So Gutted  More So For My Husband As It Was All For Him As It Was A 40Th Birthday Surprise.. My Husband And I Feel I Have Wasted Alot Of Money..  And Would Really Like It If You Would Be Ever So Kind And Get Back To Me Via Email;Jackiegraham77@Hotmail.Co.Uk.. Even Your Response Time Is Not Acceptable  As I Have Been Waiting Since The 3Rd Febuary For Somebody To Acknollage My Email....Many Thanks.,,,,,
,333,I Booked Treatments For Sat 4.30 Direct When Booking Stay  Also Added On Extras. On Arrival Time Changed To 3 Pm And We Had Only Just Arrived At 2.15.. Also My Friends Head Massage Not Booked And No Time Left On Sat. Rebooked For Sun Then Mine Was Booked Incorrect With No Oil And As Not Heated Had To Have Massage Without. A Bit Annoyed To Say The Least  Spoke To Spa Manager Who Gave Us Vouchers For Next Visit. The Booking System Needs Attention.!,,,,,
,334,I Enjoyed My Stay At Careys Manor  Despite A Very Upset Stomach That I Experienced The Night Of My Birthday. After Having Eaten At The Zen Garden For Lunch And The Manor For Dinner. Which Was An Unfortunate Note To End My Birthday On. The Balloon And Chocolates That Were In My Room On Arrival  Was A Very Nice Touch.

Unfortunately When Trying To Book My Stay  I Found Something’S Were Unclear. I Tried To Book The Simple Detox Break  Which Includes A Free 60 Minute Treatment  I Was Unsure Which Treatment I Could Pick From  As I Could Not Find Anything On The Site. This Prompted Me To Call Up To Check  This Was When I Was Told That The  Supplements Apply For Other Treatments That Exceed £76. I Did Query Where This Was Stated On The Site But The Individual Who I Spoke  Who I Would Prefer Not To Name  Was Unable To Tell Me Where This Could Be Found. Fortunately The Treatment My Partner And I Wanted Cost £76.  ,,,,,
,336,Very Helpful On The Phone When I Needed To Change The Dinner Reservation.,,,,,
,342,We Had A Little Confusion On Our Room When We First Arrived  Then Was Given The Key To Our New Room  On Arriving To Our Room We Were Shocked As It Had Not Been Cleaned  But As Soon As We Phoned Reception This Was Rectified Very Quickly And They Were Very Apologetic.,,,,,

,357,As Per Comments Above,,,,,
,361,Stef In Reservations Was Fantastic. Friendly  Knowledgeable And Efficient. ,,,,,

,369,Very Welcoming ,,,,,
,373,No - Very Welcoming,,,,,
,374,Everyone Was Very Helpful And Up Graded Our Room Which Was A Lovely Surprise,,,,,
,375,No,,,,,
,378,The Main Manor Was Lovely  But As I Said Earlier On The Other Part Of The Hotel Was Shabby..,,,,,
,381,After Booking I Found Out That There Was A Cheaper Package Available For The Same Room But With Extra's Included. Although I Was Happy To Pay  It Would Have Been Nice To Know That This Option Was Available When I Booked On The Phone.,,,,,
,383,Just Everyone Helpful And Willing To Help. Man Who Took Us To Our Room Was So Polite  Warm And Helpful - Offered To Take My Girlfriends Bag - Lovely Guy.,,,,,
,385,Missed Any Signs Pointing To The Reception And Ended Up In The Main Car Park.,,,,,
,389,We Were Booked Into A First Floor Garden Suite Which We Wanted My Immobile Legs Would Not Take Me Upstairs Could Not Believe In Such A Perfect Hotel No Lift,,,,,
,392,After The Initial Booking I Wished To Add Some Treatments To The Package I Had Booked. My Questions Regarding This Were Quickly Resolved And The Extra Treatments Added. Working In A Customer Facing Role Myself I Was Very Impressed With The Friendly And Professional Manner. ,,,,,
,393,None,,,,,
,396,Not Really All Was Fine As I Would Have Expected.,,,,,

,409,As Stated Previously  The Check In Was Slow.,,,,,
,410,Exceptionally Organised And The Porter Was Wonderful,,,,,

,426,Reception Staff On Phone And Via Email Did Their Best To Accommodate Our Stay,,,,,

,443,The Staff Were Very Welcoming And Escorted Us To Our Room And Showed Us The Spa Facilities And Hotel Facilities,,,,,
,445,No,,,,,
,448,As Before,,,,,
,452,General Attitude Of All Staff Highly Commendable.,,,,,
,453,The Lady I To Whom I Spoke When Making The Booking Was Very Helpful. On Arrival In Reception The Young Woman There Was Charming Too.,,,,,

,456,No,,,,,
,458,No,,,,,
,460,Excellent And Helpfull,,,,,
,463,Friendly Staff And Very Caring. Answering All Our Questions Fully.  ,,,,,

,466,We Were Met At The Train Station By A Friendly Snd Knowledgeable Concierge And Received A Warm Welcome From Reception,,,,,
,467,The Man Who Welcomed Was Ultra Friendly  Courteous & Helpful.,,,,,
,468,Staff Were Helpful Over The Phone And When We Arrived A Member Of Staff Who Was On His Way Somewhere Else Stopped And Helped Us With Our Luggage. We Found It Dissapointing Having To Park At The Side / Rear And Bring The Luggage Through To Reception  When The Front Entrance Is So Lovely. ,,,,,
,472,The Lady Who Phoned Me Regarding My Booking And To Double Check My Details  Lovely Telephone Manner  Again  So Professional Yet Relaxed And Friendly  Not That Often Business Get That Right  But You Have.,,,,,

,476,Arrival Was Qick And Easy  Out Room Was Ready When We Arrived  This Made It Easier For Us To Relax And Enjoy The Spa,,,,,
,477,No All Good.,,,,,
,488,Restaurant  Booking System Needs Attention. We Booked A Table At Zen Rest.When We Made Initial Hotel Booking. When We Arrived At Hotel We Found There Was No Booking  So We Made Another Reservation At That Time.
Then When We Arrived At The Restaurant In The Evening There Was No Record Of Our Booking  The Restaurant Manager Was Very "Short" With Us And Said They Were Fully Booked. They Eventually Found  Us A Table  After Keeping Us Waiting.
The Hotel Manager Dealt With Our Complaint Well  But It Should Not Have Happened In The First Place.

,,,,,
,492,Confusing Booking System Online ,,,,,
,495,The People I Spoke To In Reservations Were So Helpful - Especially Stefanie Robbins.  I Knew We Would Be Taken Care Of And We Were - Thank You.,,,,,
,496,Everyone Really Helpful And Friendly,,,,,
,502,The Concierge Was Warm And Friendly.  The Receptionist Was Very Ignorant.  The Welcome Was Neither Genuine  Friendly  Welcoming Or Professional. He Adopted A 'Script Like Welcome' Delivered At A Very Fast Pace With A Very Un Genuine Tone To His Voice.  The Staff In The Bar Where We Waited Until Check In Time Were Run Off Their Feet.  We Were Not Asked If We Wanted A Drink In The 30 Minutes We Sat There.,,,,,
,507,I Was Very Impressed With The Way That My Requests Were Dealt With On The Phone  And Extremely Happy With The Flowers I Asked To Be Waiting In The Room On Our Arrival.,,,,,
,509,That All Staff Were Polite Friendly Neat And Professional.,,,,,
,510,I Have Already Mentioned In The Summary The Difficulty Getting The Slight Difficulty Getting The Room Key.
The Problem Online Trying To Secure The Room We Wanted-It Said One Left But After We Filled In The Details It Said None Available So I Had To Phone Up To Secure A Room. The Following Day The Computer Once Again Said 1 Available.....So Very Slight Inconvenience There. Had I Not Phoned Though And Just Accepted There Were No Rooms You Would Have Lost A Booking And I Would Have Been Disappointed And Missed Out On A Wonderful Relaxing Time!,,,,,
,516,Very Welcoming And Organised,,,,,
,525,We Were Greeted On Arrival  The Car Was Parked For Us & Luggage Swiftly Taken To Our Lovely Room.The Receptionist Was Extremely Helpful . We Will Be Back,,,,,
,528,No,,,,,
,534,The Receptionist Was Busy When We Arrived So We Had To Wait A Bit,,,,,
,536,Chocolates Are A Great Touch The Room. Staff Were Very Well Briefed.
I Do Feel That You Could Gently Remind That Dinner Reservations Are Advisable At Zen Restaurant And You Could Offer To Reserve.
Especially For Weekends ,,,,,
,537,We Booked A Garden Room But The View Wasn't A Garden It Was A Hedge. The Garden Rooms Were Opposite Our Ones And Had A Nice View Of The Garden. ,,,,,
,539,I Liked The Pre-Arrival Email I Received Informing Me About The Weather For The Weekend And Other Useful Information.,,,,,
,544,Website Is Misleading.,,,,,
,545,None,,,,,
,546,The Lady On Reception Was Extremely Friendly. Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Her Despite It Being Busy.,,,,,
,547,Dawn Brand Was Extremely Helpful As Always.,,,,,
,549,Staff Were Very Helpful,,,,,
,552,We Were Unsure Where To Get In! We Drove Round In A Circle (On The Very Pot Holed Outward Drive!) First Time As We Weren't Sure On Where To Pull In Or Book In. Staff Were Very Helpful When We Did Go In. Decor Amazing In Main House And Rooms. Outside Brick Building A Bit Odd  Felt A Bit Out Of The Way. Soon Got Used To It Though And Loved Looking Out Onto Garden.,,,,,
,555,Effecient,,,,,
,561,Extremely Helpful And Friendly,,,,,
,562,No,,,,,
,563,The Only Negative Comment I Would Make Is That We Ordered A Bottle Of Prosecco To The Room At 7.15Pm  By 7.30 It Hadn't Arrived And We Had To Call To Chase. We Almost Didn't Have Time For It Before Dinner And Had Specifically Wanted It At 7.15 As A Surprise For One Of Our Party.,,,,,
,564,The Manor Restaurant Seriously Needs Updating. It Is Very Tired And Dated  The Music Was Dreadful And The Dividing Panels Are Very Ugly! It Doesn't Do Justice To The Wonderful Food And The Lovely Staff. Reception Seemed A Little Disorganised  But Not Seriously So  And Very Friendly.,,,,,
,568,No,,,,,
,573,None I Can Think Of.,,,,,
,577,Good Help Before Arriving Re Bookings For Spa.  As We Arrived From Rear Car Park One Of The Staff Offered To Help With Bags To Reception,,,,,
,578,No,,,,,
,580,I Rang To Confirm Dinner Booking & Treatment And Service Was Excellent,,,,,
,581,I Found The Staff Very Helpful. Unfortunately Just Before Our Arrival My Wife Couldn't Join The Party Due To Illness And Magda On Reservations Was Very Helpful In Allowing Me Convert Our Room To Single Occupancy With Price Adjustment Accordingly.,,,,,
,582,The Concierge Was Very Attentive  Thoughtful And Made Us Feel Very Welcome.,,,,,
,587,I Was Called To Confirm A Special Request Of A Bottle Of Champagne To Be Placed In The Room  When We Arrived  It Was Set Up With A Ballon And A Card. Wonderful ;),,,,,
,591,Got A Bit Lost From The Car Park To Reception ,,,,,
,593,Pre Arrival Contact-Very Poor-There Wasn't Any So We Had No Idea That Our Lunch Had Been Booked On Our Arrival-So We Arrived After Lunch. We Had Not Been Told That Our Treatment Had Been Booked For 4Pm-So Had To Rush From Reception To Get Changed. Not Ideal. 
,,,,,
,594,It Was Excellent. I Received A Weather Report Prior To Arrival And Had All The Important Information Sent To Me Within Days Of Making The (Last Minute) Booking.
The Staff Were All Friendly And Welcoming. Really Cannot Fault Them Or The Hotel At All.,,,,,
,595,The Porter Who Carried Our Bags Was Very Frendly And Informative,,,,,
,596,Reservation Team And Reception Were Very Accomodating,,,,,
,599,Bit Busy With A Wedding .. But Ok,,,,,
,600,Welcoming   Friendly   & Helpful,,,,,
,602,First Class Greeting  Shown Round Hotel All Very Good,,,,,
,604,Excellent,,,,,
,606,Friendly And Professional Porter. Drive Our Car To A Parking Spot Near Our Room And Delivered Our Bags. Genuinely Wanted To Give Us A Great Welcome.,,,,,
,607,Everyone Very Friendly Indeed,,,,,
,608,Check In At 1500 Felt A Bit Late. ,,,,,
,609,No,,,,,
,610,Lovely Chocs In Room,,,,,
,613,No,,,,,
,618,When Trying To Book A Massage Online For My Husband As A Surprise Gift  The Email Kept Bouncing Back So I Eventually Had To Ring.  Good Reception/Welcoming And Although We Had To Wait For Checkout Due To A Queue It's Not Surprising.,,,,,
,619,Reservation Arrangements Prior To Our Stay Was Good  Staff Would Call Back When Promised To! Efficient Service! Plus It Was My Birthday And I Was Chuffed By The Room Upgrade And Balloon  Gift And Card It Really Made My Stay!,,,,,
,625,It Would Be Good If You Highlighted The 10% Discount For Not Travelling By Car More Obviously/Told Us When We Checked In Without A Car. ,,,,,
,627,Everything Was As Expected  Very Friendly.,,,,,
,628,Excellent Greeting Friendly And Professional,,,,,
,629,Pre Arrival Contact With Claire And Dawn Was Excellent.,,,,,
,631,There Was A Disparity Between The Price Advertised On Careysmanor.Com And The Price At Reception. However  This Was Made Up For By The Service Received,,,,,
,636,All Expertly Handled And Made To Feel 'Special'.,,,,,
,637,Very Helpful In The Reservation Team.,,,,,
,639,Very Welcoming,,,,,
,640,Awesome ,,,,,
,641,Friendly Staff On Arrival   Explained Everything Well. Phoned Before To Add Treatments And Very Helpful Staff On Telephone.,,,,,
,646,Everybody Was Very Helpful And Kind,,,,,
,650,Made Very Welcome. The Concierge Man That Showed Us To Our Room Was Great And Explained Everything The Hotel Had To Offer. He's Obviously Very Proud Of His Hotel And Place Of Work.  ,,,,,
,651,There Was A Slight Delay As The Reception Desk Was Unmanned When We Arrivied  We Could Hear People Out The Back But It Took A Few Minutes For Them To Realise That We Were Waiting To Check In.,,,,,
,653,Very Good.,,,,,
,654,Everybody Was Very Friendly We Were Welcomed From The Beginning To The End Of Our Stay ,,,,,
,657,Just Fine.,,,,,
,661,The Reservation Team Were Very Helpful On The Phone ,,,,,
,662,Fantastic Receptionist,,,,,
,668,N/A,,,,,
,669,The Reception Staff Were Very Pleasant And Efficient. Thank You,,,,,
,671,Everything Was Fine,,,,,
,672,Were A Bit Lost Between The Carpark And The Reception Maybe A Few Directional Signs From The Carpark.,,,,,
,673,Communication Was Via Email And Was Helpful. The Member Of Staff On Reception Was Very Friendly And Helpful When We Arrived.,,,,,
,675,Could Not Ask For More ,,,,,
,677,Excellent,,,,,
,682,I Booked And Paid For 3 Rooms For 2 Nights  So Was Somewhat Shocked That One Of The Other Members Of The Party Was Upgraded Rather Than Me Who Made The Booking And Was Paying. However When We Raised The Matter With The Receptionist She Informed The Duty Manager Who Immediately Rectified The Situation.,,,,,
,683,We Could Not Find Exact Instructions On How To Get There On Your Web Site,,,,,
,684,The Old Features Were Beautiful  But The Place Needed Decorating It Was Old Fashioned  Nothing Matched  And The Furniture Was Dirty.,,,,,
,685,It Was All Very Professioal,,,,,
,687,Only The Previous Comment Regarding The Man At The Thai Restaurant  Other Than That The Whole Experience Was Lovely As Were All Other Members Of Staff  I Would Just Suggest He Needs To Improve His Customer Service Skills.,,,,,
,688,The Directions To The Car Park Are Confusing  We Circled The Hotel Twice Before Finding The Rear Car Park And Walking Back To Reception.  It Is Not Clear Where Reception Is Situated And Its Not Clear That You Can Park In Front Of The Reception Building And Then Relocate To Main Car Park Once Checked In.,,,,,
,689,Mike Juszczak Was Exceptional In His Service And Attention To Detail. In Addition Anya Allison Was Most Helpful And Polite In Taking Our Booking With The Minimum Of Fuss,,,,,
,694,No,,,,,
,696,Not At All,,,,,
,697,Asked Several Times Where We Could Get A Coffe On Arrival  But Was Not Directed To The Relaxation Room  However  We Found Coffee And Tea Making Facilities In The Room. Helpful Valet Car Parking .,,,,,
,698,Just Very Helpful,,,,,
,702,No,,,,,
,705,Nothing To Add To The Praises I've Already Written.,,,,,
,708,No,,,,,
,714,When I Phone To Make Dinner And Treatment Reservations The Lady I Spoke To Was Friendly And Very Helpful.,,,,,
,718,Didn't Know Whether It Was Appropriate To Tip The Gentleman Who Parked Our Car For Us.,,,,,
,719,Fantastic Service From The Gentleman That Met Us At The Door And Took Us On A Tour Before Showing Us Our Room.,,,,,
,720,As I Booked Online  All The Money Was Taken For 3 Nights Immediately Which Is Very Unusual  So We Had Paid Fully Before We Even Stepped Foot In The Hotel  Also The Lad Who Showed Us To Our Room Did Not Fully Explain About The Hotel Facilities Eg Use Of Wifi  Senspa Etc Which We Had To Visit The Reception To Find Out,,,,,
,721,Was An Excellent Hotel We Really Enjoyed Our Night Thank You ,,,,,
,723,The Ladyt On Arrival Was Plesent And Friendly Other Reception Staff Not So   Aside From Gentleman On Last Day Was Polite ,,,,,
,724,Excellent Customer Service Over The Telephone When We Made The Booking.   Your Reception Staff Are A Credit To You. ,,,,,
,727,We Were 30 Minutes Late Due To A Delayed Train Out Of London - Because Of This  We Were Unable To Sit Down At The Restaurant As Planned  But Worst Of All The Staff Member Did Not Offer Any Suggestions. The Rooms Themselves Were Unclean  There Was Hair On The Bed Pillows And In The Shower - And The Showers Had No Pressure And Were Covered In Limescale. ,,,,,
,728,The Service Is Brilliant And The Little Reminders About Staying And What To Expect Are Just Right. ,,,,,
,729,Porter Who Showed Us To Our Room Was Absolutely Outstanding,,,,,
,732,Welcoming,,,,,
,733,Excellent  Especially The Warm Welcome Immediately On Arrival.  Being Shown Around Was Very Helpful,,,,,
,734,No.,,,,,
,739,No,,,,,
,743,Helpful Front Desk Staff  Parked My Car For Me And Fully Explained How Things Work  Ie Where Restaurant And Bar Is And So On,,,,,
,744,None,,,,,
,746,As Previously Mentioned  Customer Service Was Faultless. Both Staff And Surroundings Were Welcoming.,,,,,
,747,Just Great Reception Every Time We Return.  We Have Been Coming For Over 16 Years We Have Seen Many Changes But The Standards Have Always Been Fantastic.,,,,,
,749,Good To Be Welcomed As We Drove Up And Car Taken Care Of,,,,,
,751,The Man To Greet And Tour Was Most Welcome,,,,,
,752,The Only Downside O9f Décor Was That It Would Have Been Nice To See The Thai Theme Extended To The Other Hotel Areas  Not Just The Spa. The Traditional And In Places Slightly Shabby Traditional Décor Didn'[T Sit That Well Alongside The Thai Theme Elsewhere.,,,,,
,755,Email Confirming Booking Was Ambiguous As It Did Not Make Clear Whether The Requested Restuarant Bookings Had Been Made. We Therefore Had To Phone To Clarify.,,,,,
,756,Booking Staff And Reception Staff Very Friendly  Helpful And Welcoming.,,,,,
,761,We Were Helped Parking Our Veteran Car And Everyone Was Very Welcoming,,,,,
,763,Suzie At Reception Was Extremely Professional And Friendly.,,,,,
,765,The Checkout Process Is A Bit Convoluted When Staying On A Spa Break  Especially When Checking Out The Hotel In The Morning  But Using The Spa For The Rest Of The Day. It Would Be Nice To Have Just One Check Out Process When We Can Settle The Whole Account As We're Leaving The Spa,,,,,
,767,As Usual The Administration Team Were Extremely Helpful And Efficient. I Always Like To Book The Same Room As I Love The Location Close To The Entry To The Spa.,,,,,
,769,The Booking Prior To Arrival Was Brilliant But There Again When Trying To Book Treatments In The Spa It Was Really Quite Impossible And One Of The Staff Members Was Really Short Will Me And Just Did Not Understand What I Was Trying To Ask. It Almost Made Me Cancel My Hotel Booking As That Was One Of The Main Reasons For Coming. ,,,,,
,775,Very Friendly Reservation And Reception Staff Who Did Everything To Meet Our Requests And On Arrival Ensured Signing In Was Trouble Free And Most Welcoming. Every Member Of Staff Genuinely Wanted To Assist And Without Exception  Were Always Smiling  Creating An Exceptionally Warm Atmosphere. ,,,,,
,777,Only As Above,,,,,
,778,I Found It Hard To Book Due To Your Policy Of A Min If A Two Night Stay For Saturday. We Could Not Book Two Night Due To Work Commitments And The Reason For Our Stay Was A Special Occasion (My Husbands Birthday And Our 4 Week Wedding Anniversary Which We Got Married At You Venue Aswel) I Was Originally Declined My Request For A One Night Stay But I Called Francoise Who Managed To Sort This Out But It Did Seem Like A Lot Of Effort On My Part Just To Book A Night Away. Again I Feel If We Have Stayed Before We Should Have Been Told About The Loyalty Programme As We Have Stayed 3 Times Since The 2Nd May. ,,,,,
,779,I Made Couple Of Phone Calls Prior To Coming And The Receptionist Was Great.,,,,,
,782,I Tried To Book Online But It Did Not Complete So I Booked Direct Which Was Fine Until I Then Got A Call Saying My Card Details Were Wrong And My Table Booking Could Not Be Found - It Was Sorted Out Politely & Professionally But Was A Bit Of A Pain.   ,,,,,
,783,Excellent Experience All Round/,,,,,
,786,Very Helpful Staff,,,,,
,788,All Enquiries Were Met With Efficiency.,,,,,
,796,No,,,,,
,800,I Did Ring To Make My Reservation  And My Number Was Taken With The Promise Of A Call Back As Staff Were Otherwise Engaged. I Didn't Receive That Call Back And Subsequently Booked Online.,,,,,
,802,No  Very Friendly As Always,,,,,
,803,We Called To Check Our Dinner Reservations Were In Fact In Place As Made On Line And Spoke To A Very Helpful Lady Who Onfirmed That They Were Indeed In Place And Explained Our Rhassoul Treatment In The Spa .  We Did Discover On Arrival That Our Dinner Reservation Had Only Beenmade For Our First Night's Stay So Were Glad We Had Checked As We Would Have Assumed We Were Booked In On The Second Night Also.,,,,,
,808,Wedding Party Blocking Drive And Made Some Unpleasant Comments As We Drove Through.

We Waited An Unacceptably Long Time To Check-In. A Member Of Staff Literally Stood Doing Nothing Whilst We Queued Behind A Couple Checking In. He Made No Attempt To Help Us  Explain Why He Was Standing Around Doing Nothing  And When We Asked For Someone Else To Check Us In  He Was Obviously Unhappy At Our Request. A Poor Start To Our Visit.

By Contrast  The Person Who Showed Us To Our Room Was Polite  Helpful And Gave A Good Impression Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,817,Both Excellent,,,,,
,818,It Was Very Professional And Easy  ,,,,,
,822,I Phoned To Make My Reservation And Found The Staff To Be Extremely Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,
,826,We Appreciated Having Help With Our Suitcases From The Car To Our Room As My Partner Is Heavily Pregnant.,,,,,
,827,Not Really. Everything Went Smoothly & We Had A Wonderful Stay ,,,,,
,828,The Young Guys That Took Our Luggage And Showed Us Around And To Our Rooms Were Very Friendly And Professional.,,,,,
,830,Very Satisfactory,,,,,
,833,Very Helpful,,,,,
,838,Very Warm And Welcoming. Our Room Was Even Ready For Us Earlier Than Expected. We Were Very Pleased That We Were Able To Use The Leisure Facilities Even Before The Pre Arranged Check In Time Of 3Pm. On Telephoning To Check We Were Told We Could Leave Our Luggage With Reception  We Actually Did Not Need To As The Room Was Ready Early. Fantastic Service.,,,,,
,839,Welcoming Staff ,,,,,
,842,Reception Staff Very Helpful On The Telephone. Thorough And Polite.,,,,,
,843,The Staff Are Lovely  Friendly And Warm And You Are Made To Feel Like An Individual.,,,,,
,845,Absolutely Fantastic Staff From Hotel To Spa  Very Helpful Nothing Was Too Much With Brilliant Attitude. It Actually Made The Stay So Good,,,,,
,847,Everything Very Satisfactory,,,,,
,848,Excellent Information And Efficiency From The Booking Staff By Email And On The Phone.
On Arrival Was Greeted By Manager Who Parked The Car - Very Impressed With Service. Friendly But Not Stuffy Welcome. Reception Staff Were Very Helpful And Welcoming Too.,,,,,
,849,Staff Were Brilliant On Arrival And The Service Provided Was Excellent. ,,,,,
,853,Excellent Service,,,,,
,856,The Staff Were Very Friendly + Helpful  Especially Peter,,,,,
,859,When I Called Reservations I Had To Ask For The £100 Discount When Staying 4 Nights  This Option Was Not Offered To Me Until I Mentioned As I Had Seen The Offer On The Website.  I Do Feel That As A Repeat Visitor The Discount Should Have Been Offered To Me Without Me Having To Request It.  Surely You Wish To Have Repeat Business And Recommendations? By Looking After Your Regular Visitors You Are More Likely To Get The Repeat Business And Recommendations.  I Was Planning To Bring A Group For A Weekend Before Christmas This Year But Am Having Second Thoughts Based Upon This Last Visit.  As I Said The Decoration Is Poor  Especially In The Dining Room  It Is Also Very Gloomily Lit  Which Isn't Very Appealing In The Morning!,,,,,
,861,Good Communication With Joelle. However  We Did Have To Prompt The 10% Discount As We Had Booked Two Treatments. ,,,,,
,862,Reservations Need To Pass On Specific Customer Requirements To The Restaurants.,,,,,
,864,Very Helpful Conversation The Day Before When Booking A Treatment For My Wife Resulted In Some Good Advice Regarding Facilities (Eg Bicycle Hire  Restaurant Options) As Well As Courtesy Transport From The Station.,,,,,
,865,All Staff Were Friendly And Welcoming From Booking The Break And During,,,,,
,866,The Staff Were Very Helpful And Friendly.,,,,,
,871,Disappointed That Despite The Request For An Early Check In For A Spa Day  The Room Could Not Be Made Available Before 2.30Pm,,,,,
,873,Front Desk Very Helpful When I Asked About Cycling Routes From The Hotel,,,,,
,874,Entrace Is Not Immediately Obvious And So We Ended Up Driving Around The Side And Then Had To Carry Our Bags Right Across The Property,,,,,
,877,Very Friendly And Welcoming Arrival.  When Booking The Restaurants By Phone The Lady Was Polite And Helpful.
A Map To The Destination And App Were Also Provided. Most Helpful.,,,,,
,880,The Main Reception Was Lovely  However The Further Away Down The Corridor You Went It Felt A Little Less Welcoming. The Signage Could Be Improved To Assist Guests,,,,,
,882,It Should Be Made Clearer On The Booking Confirmation That Use Of The Spa Facilities Are Limited To A Hotel Guest Unless They Pay For An Extra Package. Use Of The Leisure Facilities Mentioned Does Not Clarify That Some Areas Are Not Accessible As A Hotel Guest  Even If You Book Treatments. Seems Very Strange.,,,,,
,886,Found The Decor Out Of Reception And Towards The Garden Rooms Were Although Not Tired But Outdated And Had An 'Old People's Home Feel. Not A Feeling Of Luxury.,,,,,
,887,Would Have Preferred An Earlier Check In Time.  Had Congratulations Balloon And Chocolates Which Was A Nice Touch,,,,,
,889,Very Good Experience!,,,,,
,890,Reservation Was Made Over The Phone And The Lady Who Took The Reservation Was Very Helpful And Knowledgeable About The Different Rooms And Rates Available. ,,,,,
,892,We Had To Postpone Our Booking For 1 Day Your Management Were Very Understanding Of This.,,,,,
,895,Excellent,,,,,
,897,Very Helpful Staff,,,,,
,898,No,,,,,
,901,The Drive Was Blocked By 2 Large Commercial Vehicles  But They Were Eventually Organized And Parked.,,,,,
,903,Layout Was Confusing And Although The Room  Spa And Restaurant Were Excellent Still Feel Needs Better Direction/ Layout,,,,,
,904,Sadly You Guarantee A Check In Of 3Pm This Did Not Happen And It Was 3.30 By The Time We Got To Our Room . ,,,,,
,908,Thank You For The Up Grade ,,,,,
,910,Excellent Arrival - We Were Met  Shown Where To Park And Taken Through To Reception To Register  Given Full Hotel Information And Made To Feel Very Welcome.,,,,,
,913,Concierge Was Very Helpful And Offering To Park The Car Was Much Appreciated ,,,,,
,918,We Had E Mail From You Welcoming Us And Weather Report Very Nice Touch ,,,,,
,921,You Are Met With A Very Warm And Polite Welcome.,,,,,
,924,Reception Staff Friendly  Helpful And Professional,,,,,
,926,The Pre-Booking And Email Confirmation Service Was Very Good  However We Did Not Experience A Very Professional Welcome As There Was A Mix Up With Our Rooms.  Having Said That The Duty Manager  Bob Was Excellent And Sorted This Out For Us Straight Away With A Complimentary Glass Of Champagne.,,,,,
,930,Not The Best Stay. Bottle Of Preseco Not In Room On First Night As Promised  I Had To Ask Three Different People At Different Times On The Second Day Until Someone Delivered Bottle To Room. I Expected This To Be Dealt With With Only One Request  Not Three.

 Breakfast On The First Morning. Ordered A Vegetarian Breakfast  Which Took Nearly 30Mins To Arrive  Had To Ask Three People Where It Was And Was Assured It Was On It Way. I Had Finished My Breakfast And Sat Waiting In An Emptying Breakfast Room As My Wife Became More Agitated At The Lack Of Her Breakfast And Service.

Despite Booking Over The Phone And 'Paying' For My First Night At The Time  I Was Shocked To See A Full Bill On Check-Out  Which Included The First Night. I Was Informed That This Sometimes Happens And That If I Went Away And Checked My Bank And I Had Been Charged Twice That I Could Call Up And Get A Refund.

Overall  What Was Supposed To Be A Luxurious And Relaxing Break Was Not What I Expected For The Price I Paid I Expected A Much Better Overall Experience.

I Have Had To Put My Wife Off Posting Her Review On Trip-Advisor Until I Have Given You The Chance To Reply To My Concerns.

,,,,,
,933,No,,,,,
,937,Brilliant. Wonderful Staff.Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Your Staff. Taking In A Birthday Present And Leaving It In The Room On Arrival Day. Also Forwarding On A Late Birthday Card.  It Made My Birthday Celebration  Extra Special. ,,,,,
,942,Liked The Little Touch With The Pre Email About Weather Etc,,,,,
,943,All Very Helpful,,,,,
,945,Just A Lack Of A Lift For Elderly Clients.,,,,,
,948,From The Moment We Arrived  There Was A Genuine Warm Welcome From Staff At The Reception.
Help Was Provided With The Luggage And Staff Were Enquiring If All Was Well At All Times.
The Staff  Regardless Of Their Roles  Had The Same Goal...To Please.   ,,,,,
,949,I Had A Few Queries Along The Way And The Staff In The Reservations Department Were Friendly And Extremely Helpful.,,,,,
,950,Pre Arrival Was Good
Arrival Good,,,,,
,951,Staff Very Helpful. Made Partners Birthday Very Special. ,,,,,
,954,Check In Could Provide More Information On What Is Covered During Your Stay. Mind You This Could Be Down To The Person Who Booked However You Could Really Wow Your Guests By Asking If They Know About What Is Covered In Their Package. 
,,,,,
,957,Your Website Indicated You Were Fully Booked; It Was Only Because We've Stayed Before And Really Liked It That I Thought To Phone Direct And Was Able To Book A Room. 
Clearly Very Busy On Arrival  There Was No Space In Car Park But Manager Very Good And Personally Showed Us To The Loading Bay Parking Space.,,,,,
,958,My Only Negative Comment Would Be The Price Of Your Drinks £11.00 For Two Small Brandy's You Can Nearly Buy A Whole Bottle For That ! Not All Your Guests Are Loaded   ,,,,,
,959,See Previous Comments.,,,,,
,960,The Man Who Greeted Us At The Door And Took Us To Our Room Was Lovely. He Seemed To Actually Care How We Were :-) ,,,,,
,961,Car Parking Arrangements Somewhat Confusing To Begin With. I Was Paying For 2 Rooms And The Receptionist Blurted Out The Rates In Front Of Her  Embarrassing Her. Receptionist Should Show Rates On Check-In Sheet.,,,,,
,963,I Requested Our Room To Be Setup As It Was My Girlfriends Birthday. Very Pleased To Arrive A See A Balloon And Chocolates In The Room. Very Nice Touch. ,,,,,
,964,I Did Ask For A Room On The First Floor And This Request Was Granted.  ,,,,,
,968,All The Staff Were Very Friendly And Helpful  And As Soon As We Entered They Made Us Very Welcome.,,,,,
,969,Trouble Parking (Due To Wedding About To Take Place  Had To Drive Around The "Estate" Twice In Order To Finally Find A Space).,,,,,
,971,Staff We're Very Helpful On The Phone,,,,,
,972,See My Previous Comments Re The Lack Of A Lift.,,,,,
,973,All Good.,,,,,
,976,None ,,,,,
,979,Except In Manor Restaurant,,,,,
,980,Last Time We Came We Had Some (I Hope Constructive) Criticism Of The Check-In And Check-Out  Because Of Congestion At The Desk.  You Replied Very Positively  And Clearly These Issues Have Been Addressed - It Was All Very Smoothe And Without Delays.,,,,,
,982,We Were Incorrectly Informed That Our 2Nd Night's Stay Included The Dinner Option (£40 Pp).  I Queried That The 2Nd Night Included This And Was Assured It Was.  I Queried It Because I Was Pretty Sure This Only Applied To The First Night (As Gleaned From The Website).  When We Received Our Bill  I Was Right.,,,,,
,984,The Doorman On Wednesday Afternoon  16Th  Was Fantastic. Ray?  He Welcomed Us  Gave Us A Thorough Tour Of The Facilities And Our Room  Parked The Car And Delivered Our Bags. The Staff I Spoke To On The Phone To Arrange Our Stay Were All Very Helpful  Efficient And Friendly. The Email Correspondence Was Good Too.,,,,,
,985,Your Cocktails Were Quite Lethal  So Unfortunately I Don't Remember Much Of The Latter Stages Of The Evening. Nonetheless  A Thoroughly Splendid Time Was Had All Round.,,,,,
,986,Confusion Trigns,,,,,
,987,All Great Except Comments Above Re Noise. Massage Best I Have Had (Oregnancy Massage). Spa Staff Uniformly Pleasant And Helpful  Especially The Gentleman I Believe Is The Manager-Sorry Forgotten Name. French Lady (I Think) On Reception Very Helpful  As Was The Lady Who Checked Us In And With Whom I Had Spoken On The Phone Weds A.M.
Restaurant Staff La Blairaise Also Very Charming. 
My Bill Was Wrong But Put Right  So No Problems There. ,,,,,
,989,Ray Was Brilliant Even Though My Bag Felt Like I Had Packed Rocks  He Picked It Up Without Grimacing And Still Was Able To Chat To Us En Route To Our Rooms!,,,,,
,992,Very Welcoming,,,,,
,997,We Do Not Consider The Staff In General Were As Friendly And Welcoming As On Our First Visit  But That Time Was Exceptional.,,,,,
,1000,Quick And Efficient. Many Thanks For My Complimentary Room Upgrade. ,,,,,
,1001,I Booked A Table Online For The Manor Restaurant And Received An Email Confirmation But When I Checked The Day Before We Arrived It Hadn't Been Logged ,,,,,
,1003,How Do You Improve On Perfection?...,,,,,
,1004,The Concierge Was Very Friendly & Helpful. Gave Us Information & Advice About The Hotel. The Receptionist Was Friendly & Welcoming,,,,,
,1005,Ray Was Very Helpful On Arrival  Top Class,,,,,
,1006,The Staff Were Very Professional And Friendly - One Very Small Criticism Is That We Had To Go Looking For Someone To Serve Us Drinks In The Seated Area Under The Trees At The Front Of The Hotel After We Arrived ,,,,,
,1008,Appreciated The Pre Arrival Email And Check In Was Very Welcoming.,,,,,
,1011,We Had A Free Upgrade Which Was Fabulous And Certainly A Positive Factor In Deciding Where To Go Again,,,,,
,1014,Very Good Service On Booking The Break   Especially When We Got The Call About A Big Business Meeting Taking Place  Offerred Same Room On New Dates.,,,,,
,1015,Reception Had Incorrect Details Of My Spa Booking. The Spa Reception Was Phoned And Had The Correct Treatment  But The Time Was Incorrect. I Went Back To Double Check My Treatment Time At Hotel Reception. When It Was Time For The Said Treatment I Arrived At The Time Given To Me Hotel Reception And To My Horror Was Told I Was Too Late For The Treatment! Fortunately The Spa Staff Were Very Professional And Apologised For The Mistake  And Offered A Treatment The Following Day- Which Was Heavenly! Thank You Spa Staff,,,,,
,1017,Meet &Greet Gentleman Most Helpful,,,,,
,1019,Pre-Arrival Contact Was First Class. I Had To Cancel Our First Booking Owing To Ill Health And I Was Extremely Impressed With How The Cancellation And Re-Booking Were Handled.

3Pm Is Quite A Late Check In Time. We Had Been Travelling During The Morning And We Were Hot But It Was Too Early To Check In.,,,,,
,1020,The Reception Staff Told Us That We Could Use The Sen Spa After Our Treatments  Without Having Paid To Use The Spa. The Spa Reception Staff Told Us That Was Not The Case And That We Would Have To Pay An Additional £25 Each To Use The Spa Facilities.,,,,,
,1021,Friendly Efficient,,,,,
,1023,Reception Staff Tried Quite Hard And Were Friendly But The Service Lacked Professionalism And We Were Not Told Simple Details Like Times Of Breakfast  Where It Was  We Were Not Going To Be Shown To Our Room Initially Etc,,,,,
,1024,Pleasant Friendly And Helpful To A Fault.,,,,,
,1028,Staff Where Helpful And Friendly.
,,,,,
,1029,Ambience  Design And Interior Decoration Of The Reception And Main Staircase Area Is Lovely  As Is Inside The Spa Area. The Rest Of The Hotel Was Disappointing On This Level.,,,,,
,1033,Stefanie Was Extremely Helpful On The Phone Regarding Changing My Booking And Making Sure I Got The Best Deal Possible,,,,,
,1034,Thought The Bathroom Needed Refurbishing,,,,,
,1039,Regarding The Dietary Requirements: We Were Asked As Part Of The Phone Booking If We Had Dietary Requirements. Having Requested Lactose Free  We Were Disappointed To Find This Had Not Been Followed.,,,,,
,1044,Refurbishment Of The Rooms Is Vital If You're To Continue In Business,,,,,
,1045,Too Many Emails Asking Us To Book Other Things. ,,,,,
,1046,Peter Was Very Kind And Helpful. He Showed Us Around The Hotel And Spa And Helped Us With Our Bags. We Felt Very Special. From Start To Finish Our Experience Of Carey's Was Absolutely Wonderful. ,,,,,
,1047,Was Told By Reservations That Would Only Be Able To Use The Pool From Check In To Check Out However Was Pleasantly Surprised To Be Able To Use It After Checkout ,,,,,
,1049,All Of The Reservations Team Were Fantastic I Would Email Them With Questions Or Alterations   I'd Receive An Email Back To Tell Me That It Was Sorted And I Had No Worries   An Awesome Team ,,,,,
,1051,All First Class,,,,,
,1052,Please See Very Long (Sorry) Content Above. ,,,,,
,1053,Superb!  On Our Arrival  We Were Helped By Ray  Who Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1054,We Had An Excellent Welcome From Peter Who Gave Us A Tour Of The Hotel And Was Very Informative.,,,,,
,1055,The Arrival Experience Was Fine,,,,,
,1056,No,,,,,
,1057,Very Helpful And Informative,,,,,
,1062,No,,,,,
,1065,Arrived Just After 2Pm But Had To Wait To Check In At 3Pm. All Other Hotels I've Stayed In Check To See If Room Is Ready If Arrived Early. Also Would Have Avoided Everyone Turning Up At The Same Time Which Needed 4 People To Do The Check Ins At 3Pm.,,,,,
,1066,All Perfect.,,,,,
,1068,Complication When Booking Was Difficult To Get Someone To Help,,,,,
,1070,Only One Person At Check
In With Several People Waiting So Think They Should Have Called Someone Else In To
Assist As Seemed Like There Were Other Receptionsts Available Just Having A Break,,,,,
,1072,Thank You To Staff Member Who Took Us To Our Room And Showed Us Around  This Made Life Easier As We Knew Where Everything Was ,,,,,
,1073,All The Staff Are Marvellous But The Hotel Is Now Looking A Little Dated Especially The Corridors Leading From The Reception Area  To The Oakwood/Knightwood Rooms. Perhaps A Coat Of Paint And A New Carpet Would Lift The Whole Ambiance.,,,,,
,1075,Always Appreciate The Pick Up From The Station  And Enjoy Talking To Dawn On Reservations.  She Is Always A Pleasure To Deal With And Nothing Is Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,1078,Staff Were Not Professional. ,,,,,
,1080,All Handled Very Professionally And All Questions I Had Were Answered Immediately ,,,,,
,1081,The Member Of Staff At Reception Was Helpful And Polite  Checking That Restaurant Reservations Etc Were Exactly What We Wanted.  ,,,,,
,1082,Perfect As Ever,,,,,
,1083,Very Helpful And Friendly Staff ,,,,,
,1085,While Staff Were Very Friendly We Did Have To Wait While Staff Chatted For 15 Mins When We Arrived And Were Waiting For Treatments. ,,,,,
,1089,Booked Months On Advance. Then Had Tp Change The Booking By Bringing It Forward A Day.  This Was Done Over The Phone 2 Months Before Travel.  I Then Phoned To Double Check Everything As O Had Not Recieved A Response Where To My Dissatisfaction Nothing Had Beed Changed. Thankfully All Was Sorted And We Managed To Get All Corrected.,,,,,
,1093,Thank You For Making Our Stay Amazing,,,,,
,1095,None,,,,,
,1098,N/A,,,,,
,1100,Initial Contact And Welcome Was Excellent; Peter Did A Great Job Of Showing Us Our Room And Around The Spa And Also Noticed That The Aircon Wasn't Working And Went Away To Get It Fixed. ,,,,,
,1105,Check-In Very Speedy  Efficient And Friendly.,,,,,
,1107,Please Refer To My Previous Comment,,,,,
,1109,Not At All.  We Look Forward To Staying Again Soon.,,,,,
,1115,From The Initial Phone Contact And Throughout Our Stay All Staff Were Polite  Courteous And Friendly. Nothing Appeared Too Much Trouble.,,,,,
,1116,Very Happy With Our Stay. Before We Arrived Someone Called To Check With Us About Our Room Choice As We Have Two Young Children. I Found This Very Helpful,,,,,
,1117,Excellent Welcome By Paul (I Think That Was His Name).,,,,,
,1123,We Couldn't Fault Anything. Everything Was Super! ,,,,,
,1130,Breakfast Disappointing,,,,,
,1131,When I Emailed Originally To Organise The Spa Break  Joelle Was Extremely Helpful And Informative. On Arrival  The Lady On Reception Was Also Very Helpful. ,,,,,
,1133,Excellent Booking And Arrival Experience,,,,,
,1135,The Spa Area Ambience And Design Is Fantastic  The Décor/Furniture In The Reception And Lounge Area Could Do With Updating.,,,,,
,1137,Made On The Previous Form.,,,,,
,1139,All Staff A Credit To Carey Manor Hotel,,,,,
,1144,Both Receptionist And Porter Went The Extra Mile,,,,,
,1145,No,,,,,
,1147,Excellent.,,,,,
,1154,We Phoned Direct To The Hotel To Ask Questions About The Manor And The Staff Were Very Understanding And Helpful. This Gave Us Confidence In The Hotel Which Is Why We Chose To Book.,,,,,
,1156,Greeted As We Drove Into The Manor  Excellent Customer Service  Felt Welcomed From The Minute We Got Out The Car.,,,,,
,1157,I Was Told That The Dbb Option Could Be Added At Will  After Arrival.  This Was News To The Receptionist Who Had To Contact "Reservations". After Asking For This To Be Added To Our Package On The 2Nd Night  And Despite Repeated Asking  No Feedback Or Update Was Given. We Were Glad In The End That This Was Not Actioned As After The Experience On Our 1St Evening  We Didn't Wish To Eat In Again.,,,,,
,1159,This Break Was Booked As A Treat For My Girlfriend  On Arrival 10:00Hrs We Registered With Your Reception Team Who Told Us The Room Keys Would Be Forwarded To Us In The Spa. At 16;00 I Had To Chase The Keys In Reception To Be Told My Girlfriend Had To Complete A Registration Form. Why As She Was Not Paying  Nor Was There A Requirement When We Originally Registered In The Morning. It Was Resolved  But Why Was It An Issue? ,,,,,
,1160,Would Of Liked To Be Able To Get In Room Earlier,,,,,
,1163,See Other Comments,,,,,
,1166,Everyone Smiley And Helpful,,,,,
,1169,Most Welcoming From Reception And Concierge/Porter ,,,,,
,1178,All 1St Class,,,,,
,1179,It Would Have Been Good To Have Known About The Workshop Activities (Apart From Therapies Already Booked) On The Day Of Arrival In The Confirmation Email Sent Earlier In The Week So As To Be Fully Preped Up (I.E Yoga Session Running At 9:30Am)

Some Of The Thai Receptionists Didn't Quite Understand English And Got Lost In Some Conversations Explaining The Spa Facilities...We Didn't Realise There Was A Hydro Area Until We Investigated Iy Ourselves.

Also We Didn't Get Issued With The Yoga/Mind-Bodyexercises Pyjamas.,,,,,
,1183,Great Hospitality To Show Us To The Room,,,,,
,1190,A Little Bit Disjointed Maybe Being Able To Check Into The Hotel In The Spa Reception Would Make The Process Easier,,,,,
,1193,Pre Arrival Contact Was Excellent,,,,,
,1194,It Was Useful To Have A Member Of Staff Providing Me With A Tour Of The Spa.,,,,,
,1195,Reception Staff Most Helpful,,,,,
,1198,More Info On The Classes Available And What Is Included In The Package When You Book In.,,,,,
,1203,Our Room (No 20) The Decor Was Great And Up To Date. But The Reception Area And The Breakfast Room Used By Us Down Stairs Near Reception All Needs Updating....Which Is Of Course The Oldest Part Of Your Hotel. As A Now Retired Hotel Interior Designer I  Fully  Realise How Difficult It Is To Balance The Sty;Le And Appearance And Finishes In Such An Old Building With The Finishes And Styles In The Added Sections Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,1205,I Telephoned To Book A Table At The Zen Garden Restaurant And The Person Who Took My Booking Was Very Friendly And Professional.  She Also Took The Time To Find Out Why We Were Coming (Anniversary Celebration) Which Was Very Nice Of Her.  One Arrival We Had A Lovely Surprise Of A Box Of Chocolates And A Congratulatory Card.  Very Much Appreciated And Thoughtful.,,,,,
,1206,Mostly Very Nice.,,,,,
,1208,Baggage Delivery To Room Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,1210,Everyone Was Very Helpful.,,,,,
,1212,Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,
,1213,Michael At Reception Was Absolutely Superb In His Welcome  Politeness And Knowledge. ,,,,,
,1214,See 6,,,,,
,1216,None,,,,,
,1217,All In Order.,,,,,
,1218,The Young Receptionist Was Very Friendly (She'd Recently Moved From London). Taking Our Bags In And Getting Them To Our Room When It Was Ready Was Fantastic. We Had A Lovely Bunch Of Flowers That I Had Pre Ordered For My Wife And Our Welcome Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1224,The Amount Of Information Sent Prior To Arrival Was Very Good. However I Didn't Receive Any Contact Of Our Massages That We Had Booked Through The Website And It Was Only By A Phone Call To The Spa A Week Later To Check It Had Gone Through Correctly That I Was Told Of Our Times Booked And That All Was Ok Which Is The Opposite To The Level Of Communication We Had About Our Room Reservation.,,,,,

,1,Romm 78  The Tv Remote May Have Needed New Batteries But Other Than That Everything Was Great.,,,,,
,2,We Were In Room 75. The Room Was Fantastic  The Only Comment We Had Was That My Wife Got Slightly Cold During The Night And There Were No Additional Blankets Etc In The Room.,,,,,
,3,On Entering The Hotel Room I Was Very Disappointed To See A Room That Failed To Match The Grand Exterior And Professional Greeting I’D Received Moments Ago.  The Style Was Very Dated 1980’S And Not The Best Of That Era.  However The Bathroom Was Very Stylish.  Overnight The Room Was Very Hot Even With The Radiators Off And The Bed Very Soft.  Maybe My Expectations Were Unrealistic But For The £258 Spent For One Night And The Comments From Friends Suggested Something More Classic And Impressive.   ,,,,,
,4,74.  The Only Comment I Would Make That The Decor Was A Little Tired And Old Fashioned  But That Wouldn't Stop Me From Returning.,,,,,
,5,Room Was Great.,,,,,
,7,Bathroom In 97 Seemed Like It Was Due A Deep Clean  With Limescale And Some Staining On Tiles  Floor And Sink Area. (I Am Super Fussy About Cleanliness Though  So Could Just Be Me!) Also  I Think Every Single Time We've Stayed At Carey's I Have Found A Hair In The Otherwise Pristine Bed. ,,,,,
,13,Bathroom Of 97 Seems Due A Deep Clean  With Limescale Marks Around The Shower  Sink And Floor. (Could Just Be Me Being Super-Picky Though  I'm Very Particular About Cleaning) ,,,,,
,14,Room 53  Very Comfortable. ,,,,,
,15,The Wardrobes Are Cheap And Nasty For A 4*. And The Bathroom Was Small. But Otherwise A Nice Room. Nothing Special  But Not Bad.,,,,,
,16,It Was Just Right And The Ajoining Room Added To Our Needs.,,,,,
,17,Room 41. Room Was Very Clean And Tidy. ,,,,,
,23,The Wifi In The Rooms Is Patchy.,,,,,
,25,Our Heating Was Not Working In Our Room And When We Arrived It Was Chilly  I Called Reception And They Said They Would Adjust  But When We Returned Alter In The Day It Was Still Very Cold.  We Contacted Reception Again And A Problem With The Heating Was Identified  Every Time The Door Was Opened It Went Off Completely.  A Heater Was Brought For Us.  Also The Plug In The Sink Was Faulty.,,,,,
,27,Room 15 I Personally Hate The Smell Of The White Company's Toiletries - Far Too Strong. Why Not Sure Senspa Products? ,,,,,
,30,The Extended Part Of The Hotel Is Not At All In Keeping With The Main Entrance Part It Almots Feels Like A Motel..Which Is Dissappointing..It Is Also A A Little Dissappoinitng That You Need To Walk Outside To Get From The Hotel To The Spa Downstairs...This Seems Very Strange And Again Not In Keeping With The Traquility Of The Hotel And Spa,,,,,
,32,None  All More Than Satisfactory.,,,,,
,36,37- Only Comments Would Be Over Use Of Mirrors In Bathroom (Even Bath Panel !) ,,,,,
,39,First Thing You Notice Is The Ludicrous Door Barrier Across The Windows - Looks Dreadful. Sign Re Bathmat Made It Look Like A Place For The Elderly. Part Of The 'Wardrobe' Door Was Hanging Off With Its Screw Very Obviously On The Floor. First Hanger We Picked Up Broke Instantly. Why No Fridge In The Room? Sofa Looked Like It Had Been There For 20 Years - Shiny And Very Naff. Wall Pictures Equally Naff. Very Poor  Except The Bed Which Was Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,41,Room 35 - On The Whole Very Good But One Of The Robes Was Distinctly Tatty.  It Had A Hole In  And A Few Black Marks On It.  It Smelt Clean And Had Obviously Been Laundered  Which Is Why I Did Not Ask For A Replacement.  But Perhaps More Attention Could Be Paid To The Condition Of The Robes When They Are Hung In The Wardrobe?  Only A Very Minor Thing  But As We Were On A Spa Break And Were Wearing Them Going To And From The Spa It Was An Issue.,,,,,
,43,Room 46 Exceeded Expectations And Entirely Fulfilled Our Needs. Unable To Find Any Point To Criticise.,,,,,
,46,Mattress Could Have Been A Little More Comfy. The Lady Of The Room Thought It Was A Tad Lumpy.,,,,,
,51,Room 50. Layout Could Be Better. Why Is The Bed Directly Opposite The Door And Therefore Underneath The Aircon Out Let ? Should Be Position Off The Opposite Wall Thereby Removing The Above Problems. Flat Surface Around The Hand Basin Means That Any  Water Residue  As From Soap  Run Into Everything Else On The Shelf. Shelf Needs A Soap Indent And Groves To Take Water Into The Basin. ,,,,,
,52,Kettle Was Full Of Lime Scale So Could Not Be Used And It Was Not Replaced- I Rinsed It Out With Water To See If It Got Rid Of The Lime Scale Already There But To No Effect It Just Created More. Good Selection Of Coffee/Tea And Biscuits. Lovely And Clean- Could Of Had Slightly More Of A Selection With The Products In The Bathroom  Quite Limited Considering It Is A Spa Hotel. ,,,,,
,53,Number 37. The Room Was Dated And Bathroom Needed A Refurbishment. There Was No Mini Fridge In The Room And Toiletries Were Absolutely Miniature,,,,,
,57,No Fridge??,,,,,
,59,41 So Convenient For Access To Spa,,,,,
,60,A Bit Stuffy On Arrival But Fine Once Window Was Opened.,,,,,
,61,Mini Bar ,,,,,
,66,Room 42  Lovely Room And Location. Thank You For Giving Me This Room Whenever Possible,,,,,
,68,The Room We Stayed In Was Fantastic.,,,,,
,70,45 - Room Lovely And Thank You For Courtesy Balloon And Fruit For My Birthday. Rather Disappointed We Had To Pay For 'Emergency Toothpaste'!!!!! Other 4 Star Hotels We Have Stayed At Often Keep Handy '1 Night Sized' Essentials In Case You Forget Anything. Didn't Sit Well With Me After Paying So Much For The Break/Additional Treatments!,,,,,
,71,Loved Our Room  Felt Like A Real Treat.,,,,,
,73,The Bed Was Really Comfy And I Loved The Products!,,,,,
,77,The Mattress Could Have Been More Comfortable And Was Actually Quite Hard. Signs Of Mould Around The Bath And Shower. In Addition The Bathroom Small.   Like The Fact We Had Turn Down Service And Drinks Replenished,,,,,
,81,The Room Was Tired  Chipped Paintwork  Dust On The Sidelights. Towel Radiator In Bathroom Dirty And Dusty. Cracked Mirror And Extractor Fan Full Of Dust. The Room On The Whole Was Comfortable Particularly The Bed But Cleaning Let It Down!,,,,,
,84,Room 40 Just Felt It Was A Little Tired  We Had Stayed The Previous Night In A Local B&B And Both The Room And En-Suite Were Much Nicer There Than In Your Room And We Had Paid A Great Deal Less  We Were Both A Little Disappointed.,,,,,
,88,Shower Was A Bit 'Tired' - Standing On Rubber Mats In Old Baths - Not Very Modern!,,,,,
,89,Curtain Damaged In Room 76,,,,,
,92,33 Oakwood Garden Room - Excellent.,,,,,
,93,It Was Excellent!,,,,,
,95,We Were Upgraded To Room 2  Which Was A Lovely Bonus.   I Did Notice That The Paint Was Peeling On The Windows  Which Wasn't A Huge Issue  But Might Have Been If I Had Booked The Bridal Suite Specifically.,,,,,
,96,See  8,,,,,
,97,As A Returning Guest  Might Be Nice To Have Some Chocs/Fruit In The Room?,,,,,
,98,No  It Was Fine.,,,,,
,103,Bathroom Not Quite To Standard Of Main Room. Wardrobe And Drawers A Bit Fiddly.,,,,,
,104,No Comments,,,,,
,106,Although We Stayed In The Four Poster Room Which Is Intended To Have A Traditional Old Style We Found That Certain Aspects Were Not That Inviting.  We Refer To The Loose Canopy Hanging Down On The Bedstead Covering  This Was Covered In Dust! I Almost Tore My Finger Off Trying To Open The Right Hand Wardrobe Door As It Was Such A Tight Fit. The Huge Gap Between The Mattress And The Headboard Meant That My Pillow Kept Falling Into This Gap Causing My Neck To Be Strained In The Morning.  Luckily We Were Spending The Day At The Spa Which Helped This. Those Were Minor Points Considering The Age Of The Building And Furnishings And The Modern Improvements To The Room Were Very Tastefully Done And Expertly Executed. We Were Even Given A Small Box Of Chocolates Which Were In My Name  However We Had Booked The Stay Because Of My Partners Birthday So She Was Somewhat Disappointed That She Was Not Considered.  It's Not Like I Didn't Mention It Enough During My Various Discussions With Your Booking Staff.  More Attention To This Detail Would Have Really Made A Difference And It Wouldn't Have Been Costly To Execute.,,,,,
,110,The Wardrobe Looked Dated Not In Keeping With The More Modern Look Of The Rest Of The Room. Room Was Well Equipped Eg Ironing Board And Iron And Hair Dryer. Good Selection Of Teas.,,,,,
,113,All Good,,,,,
,119,56. Difficult To Manage The Heating Controls. Instructions Would Be Useful. ,,,,,
,121,Lovely And Clean. Only Downside Was In Room 20 Where We Stayed This Time The Line Down The Bed Where I Am Guessing It Turns Into A Twin  Was Very Uncomfortable  Needs A Padded Mattress Protector And Topper Perhaps To Ensure It's Not Felt So Much. ,,,,,
,122,Prefer A Shower Seperate,,,,,
,123,74 - The Room And Comfort Products In It Were Good.,,,,,
,124,Room 92,,,,,
,132,More Milk Would Be Good  Big Tea Drinkers!!!,,,,,
,138,Room 4 . Excellent Room  Great Facilities And Products And Looked After With A Great Cleaning And Turndown Service.,,,,,
,140,Rooms 31 And 32 Just What We Asked For,,,,,
,141,The Rooms Are Getting A Little Tired ,,,,,
,143,No,,,,,
,149,97 Found It Difficult To Reach Taps,,,,,
,150,A Mini Bar And Fridge Would Be Useful. It Would Be Good To Open The Balcony Door On A Latch So You Could Have Fresh Air Coming In. Air Con Can Sometimes Be Temperamental ,,,,,
,152,Room 50  A Garden Room.  Thank You For The Lovely Surprise Of The Chocolates And Champagne  Also The 'Happy Birthday' Balloon - I Felt Very Spoilt.,,,,,
,153,Room 4O  Fan In Bathroom Was Noisy But I Don't Suppose There Is Much You Can Do About That. Lots Of Cars Arriving Outside The Room  So The Other Side Might Have Been Quieter. Products Could Have Been Bigger.,,,,,
,154,Room 8. All Fine.,,,,,
,157,Few Of The Fittings Were Missing Ie Plug Plunger End.,,,,,
,159,Always Lovely  Everything Provided For Us.   Could Do With A Bit Of Redecorating At Some Point  But Always Very Clean And Welcoming.,,,,,
,160,Think I Was Room 61 - Oak With A Garden View. Cost Me Over 250 Pounds For One Night And There Was No Minibar. Rather Disappointing; In Fact It Is Such A Disappointment I Wish I Had Known Then I Could Have Brought My Own Drinks. Calling Down To Reception Or Going To The Bar Just For One Drink (Other Than Water Or Coffee) Is Not Great.,,,,,
,163,Room 56. With Two Of Us Sharing  If The Towels Are Not Replaced How Do We Know Which One Is Which? Also It Was Not Clear How Often The Towels Would Be Changed. We Spoke To The Housekeeper About This And She Was Very Helpful.,,,,,
,164,Room 37 I Found It Difficult To Sort Out The Aircon  But That Could Have Been Me,,,,,
,165,52/53 Rooms Offered Every Comfort  But Disabled/Walk In Shower Facilities Would Be Appreciated As Would Fridges,,,,,
,171,Stayed In Room 80 Knightwood Which Was Disappointing Compared To Our Last Stay Also In A Knightwood. Decor Etc Rather Tired.,,,,,
,176,Room 19. The Room Was Lovely And My Only Criticism Would Be The Bed. I Believe It's Two Singles Pushed Together.  I Slept On The Left Side As You Look At The Bed And  I Normally Do Not Suffer From Back Ache But On This One I Did. .... So I Can't Say I Had A Good Night's Sleep,,,,,
,181,Room 12   Not Happy With This Room As Already Mentioned,,,,,
,182,51 - Would Be Good Idea To Lower Mirror Over Dressing Table As Can't Actually See In It When Sat Down!,,,,,
,183,Comfy And With Nice Touches.,,,,,
,184,No,,,,,
,185,No  Excellent In Every Respect,,,,,
,188,Heating System Was Complicated And Not Effective  Plus Has To Ring Reception To "Unlock" It. The Heating Vent Was Also Noisy As The Metal Expanded/Contracted And Made Very Loud Intermittent Clicking Sounds Which Made It Difficult To Sleep.,,,,,
,189,Room 61; A Lovely Room Looking Over The Garden. Good Sized Room And Nice Big Bed. Spotlessly Clean Room And Bathroom With Good Quality Products And  Where Most Hotels Fall Down  Good Quality Toilet Paper!,,,,,
,190,No,,,,,
,191,If I'm Picky - Wifi Might Have Been Easier To Obtain!,,,,,
,192,Tv Was Small For The Size Of The Room. Wardrobe Was A Bit 70'S.,,,,,
,193,See Above,,,,,
,194,Lovely Room  Very Quiet. Great Bed.,,,,,
,198,Room 20.  The Shower Panel Would Not Close Against The Bath Consequently The Floor Got Very Wet And Dangerously Slippery. ,,,,,
,200,Room Could Have Been Presented More Nicely Considering We Paid For An Upgrade ,,,,,
,201,No,,,,,
,204,Room 64 Very Comfortable However The Bathroom Was Very Small,,,,,
,207,Room 93 Everything Fine But Could Have Done With A Heated Mirror In The Bathroom,,,,,
,211,The Shower Disappointed Slightly,,,,,
,213,Fan Was Blowing Out Cold Air Overnight Which Made Room Cold But When I Had Figured Out How To Turn It Off It Was A Lot Warmer.,,,,,
,214,The Back Of The Bathroom Door And Handle Looked Like It Had Never Been Cleaned.,,,,,
,215,Basic For Price. ,,,,,
,216,I Am A Facilities Engineer  Believe Me You Would Have Been Informed!!!!,,,,,
,217,54 The Room Was Lovely   Only Tiny Criticism Was Not Enough Milk Cartons   ,,,,,
,219,Room 31. Very Nice. Bath A Bit Small/Shallow If Being Really Picky. Also Not A Critisizm As It Makes No Difference To A Guests Stay But As A Tradesman I Notice These Things And That Is A Lot Of The Tiling Is Very Poor  Looks Like Its Been Done By Aporentices Or Something. You May Want To Look At Which Contractor You Use For The Future,,,,,
,220,Bottom Of Door Had A Large Hole In It  Room Looked A Bit Tired,,,,,
,221,Very Good.,,,,,
,222,Room 11  Good Facilities  Room Was Not The Biggest But Perfectly Acceptable For A Short Stay.  The Bathroom Could Have Been Bigger As It Was Tricky To Avoid Getting Burned By The Towel Rail When Turning.  Good Quality Toiletries.  Shower Was Quite Low For Us. Room Was Serviced Promptly In The Mornings  Turndown Tended To Be Too Early For Us As We Were Still Getting Ready For Dinner. We Found The Bed Was Too Hard  Which Made Sleeping Difficult.,,,,,
,225,None,,,,,
,226,Tea/Coffee Making Facilities In The Room,,,,,
,230,Although An Acceptable Standard  Room Getting Close To Needing Renewal,,,,,
,233,Rm 34  Beautiful  Spacious.,,,,,
,234,15 The Shower Lacked Pressure And Was Difficult To Control Temperature. ,,,,,
,236,32 The Air Conditioning Was Difficult To Adjust,,,,,
,238,See Summary. ,,,,,
,240,Larger Tv And Sky Would Be Fantastic,,,,,
,242,Room 41. Everything Was Clean. The Remote For The Television Didn't Always Work. Not Sure If That Was A Battery Or Signal Problem. ,,,,,
,244,I Had To Ask For Tissues And Loo Paper On Our Second Day So I Think Spares Should Be Available,,,,,
,246,It Was Clean But Desperately Old Fashioned.  Like Most Of The Communal Areas Of The Hotel It Really Could Do With Updating.,,,,,
,247,It Was Along Way From Reception.   Room 96,,,,,
,248,We Was Allocated Room 10 But Did Not Like It And Asked To Be Moved To 18 Which We Have Stayed In Before. The Staff Was Able To Accommodate Our Request And Moved Us Very Quickly,,,,,
,251,We Were Upgraded On Arrival To A Suite - Room 2  Our Room Had Beautiful Furniture With A Large Four Poster Bed Made Up Using Fantastic Presentation  Very Very Pleased.  I Would However Like To Bring To Your Attention The Ripped Curtains In The Living Area Which I Noticed When Drawing In The Morning Which I Was Quite Startled To Find Considering The Rest Of The Hotel & Facilities Are So Outstanding. ,,,,,
,252,46. I Was Disappointed That The Bathroom Products Weren't Replaced Daily (The Shampoo/Shower Gel/Moisturiser) So I Subsequently Ran Out Of Moisturiser - I Think When You Are Paying As Much As We Did  Bathroom Products Should Be Replenished Daily. Also  The Bathroom Was Pretty Tired Looking - Not Particularly High Standard At All  Although The Rooms On The Whole Were Very Pleasant,,,,,
,256,Room Was Very Nice. Some Damage To Fittings Which Is A Shame. But I Guess Some Guests Don't Take Care In The Room When They Away From Home. ,,,,,
,259,There Were A Large Number Of Cobwebs On The Bedside Lights.,,,,,
,261,Room No 44.My Only Surprise Was The Lack Of A Minibar In The Room,,,,,
,262,Cold,,,,,
,263,Room No 33 - We Had Some Slight Issues With Regulating/Working The Heating But Managed In The End.,,,,,
,265,We Were Bumped Up To A Suite And It Was Very Good. Huge Bed And Very Quiet.,,,,,
,267,Room 30,,,,,
,268,Room 47. Very Comfortable  Nice Temperature (Compared With Many Hotels That Are Often Too Hot).,,,,,
,279,Mugs In Rea Coffe Drawer Were Dirty,,,,,
,280,Very Good Room,,,,,
,281,Could Of Been A Better View And Better Shower,,,,,
,282,The Bed Was Really Comfortable  Being On The Groundfloor The Outlook Onto The Courtyard Garden Was Beautiful.,,,,,
,283,5.  Good Room.  Would Happily Stay In It Again. ,,,,,
,285,No,,,,,
,301,50. Minor Comment  But No Full Length Mirror In The Room And No Lamp On The Desk/Dressing Table.,,,,,
,304,The On Suite Requires Updating  There Were Broken Tiles The Shower Screen Rubber Was Broken And It Did Not Feel Clean. The Bedroom Had Dirty Marks On The Bed Valance Around The Bed And The Room Did Not Feel As Nice As The Last Time We Stayed,,,,,
,308,Last Time My Husband And I Upgraded To A Manor 4 Poster. The Cheaper Garden Room For My Friend And I Was Far Nicer - Decor  Aspect And Size/Space. I Wouldn't Stay In The Manor Room Again (5),,,,,
,309,We Where Given An Upgrade Which Was Much Appreciated.,,,,,
,312,Room 64 Uncomfortable Pillows,,,,,
,313,We Were Given A Tour If The Room Contents On Arrival Which Was Perfect. I've Stayed In Many 5* Hotels And This Is The First Time I've Received This! Made Life So Much Easier! ,,,,,
,316,Room 42. A Small Fridge Would Have Been Useful As We Brought Dairy Free Milk With Us For Tea.,,,,,
,317,In Room Number 45 - The Safe Was Dusty.,,,,,
,318,The Shower Is Great But The Screen Doesn't Keep All The Water In So The Floor Gets A Bit Wet.,,,,,
,320,Room 52 I Think  End Of Corridor Next To Le Blaireau Restaurant. I Only Answered Disagree As The Toilet Was Dirty On The Outside When We Checked In. Someone Had Been Ill And The Cleaner Hadn't Spotted It. The Rest Of The Room And Bathroom Was Immaculate And Housekeeping Attended Very Quickly To Sort The Problem,,,,,
,331,Yes Very Outdated And Looking Very Shabby For The The Price I Had Paided. I Expected A Lot Higher Standard Than This.,,,,,
,333,Ground Floor Room 33 I Think  Oakwood Upgrade Lovely Room. Next Time I Would Like Room 20 Opposite Spa And Will Request This Room. ,,,,,
,334,Room 40  Small But Worth Noting Not Many Tissues In The Tissue Box  The Bathrom Decor Looks Slightly Dated  As Does The Sofa. Was Unable To Work The Side Lamps.  ,,,,,
,336,We Feel Very Fortunate To Have Been Upgraded With Our Room. It Was A Very Kind Gesture And Made My 40Th Birthday More Memorable And Enjoyable.,,,,,
,343,Room 52 Was Ok But Very Basic For The Price  No Separate Shower Or Mini Bar To Store Anything   Tv Stations Were Minimal And Need Modernising ...........No Dvd/Music Facility,,,,,
,344,Room 46.  Delightful Room With Wonderful View Over The Garden.  Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,352,The Only Criticism Was The Water Pipes In The Ceiling Near The Door In Our Room Kept Waking Us Up During The Night And The Early Hours It Was A Pain 
Every Time Someone Used There Water Near Our Room They Made A Fair Bit Of Noise
We Would Request A Different Room Next Time    ( Room 36 ),,,,,
,353,35 - The Garden Rooms Are Our Favoured Rooms - Thanks For The Upgrade (Superior Room),,,,,
,354,96  The Room Was Fine But A Bit Dated Compared To Spa  Saying That I Don't Feel Like I Needed Anything Better And It Was Good Value For Money. ,,,,,
,357,The Key Did Not Work At First So I Took Them To The Reception And That Solved The Problem.,,,,,
,363,Please See Previous Comments About The Price You Are Charging Which Does Not Warrant A 4-Star Rating. The Shower Was Appalling.,,,,,
,364,Room 65
The Room Did Underwhelm Us Somewhat  Based On Previous Reviews And The Professional Pictures That We Saw  But It Was Comfortable And Functional. The Pillows Were A Tad Too Thick For My Personal Liking  But Not A Mentionable Issue.
There Was Some Dust About (Skirting Boards  Lamps) And The Duvet Cover Had Quite A Few Rips / Tears In  While The Actual Sheets And Pillow Cases Had Black 'Fluff' And Hair On Them - For £258.00 For Saturday Night I Expected Perfection  So Was A Bit Dismayed.
Bathroom Lovely And The Amount Of Mirrored Surfaces Were Different And Good!
Good Selection Of Tea Which Was Greatly Appreciated.,,,,,
,366,You Could Have A More Modern Hd Tv And The Size Could Be Larger.,,,,,
,368,40. 0Akwood Room. Really Liked The Fresh Milk - So Much Nicer  Than Uht.

When We Arrived  We Were Cold. Within 5 Minutes We Had A Heater Provided - We Were Made To Feel So Welcome.,,,,,
,373,A Little More Attention Needs To Be Paid To The Plug Holes - Puledl The Plug Out In Room 5 And It Was Not Pleasant. ,,,,,
,374,It Was An Excellent Room But I Would Have Like To Have Been Able To Turn The Warm Air Conditioning Off At Night And Have An Extra Blacket On The Bed..
,,,,,
,375,Room 47  See Previous Comment,,,,,
,378,Room 67: Nice View  Quiet  See Earlier Comments For The Rest.,,,,,
,379,Room 11 Didn't Like The Laundry Bags Left In Hallway For So Long   ,,,,,
,382,Would Have Liked To Have More De Caff Tea Bags In Room And More Milk  We Requested More But Received Only 2 Extra Bags And Three Milks  A Little Mean We Thought.,,,,,
,383,Bed - Amazing. Room Design Lovely  Spacious. Excellent Room.,,,,,
,389,Large And Light Perfect,,,,,
,392,On The Day Of Arrival Which Was My Partners Birthday I Had Proposed  We Mentioned This To The Porter On The Way To The Room. We They Took Use Of The Facilities For The Day And Upon Arriving Back In The Room There Was A Bottle Of Champagne From The Hotel Manager To Congratulate Us. It Was Clear The Porter Had Taken The Time To Go Back And Mention Our Engagement. It Was A Nice Personal Touch Which Made Us Feel Very Welcome ,,,,,
,393,Room 8 - There Could Have Been Some Mention On The Website That The Room Overlooked A Roof With Air Conditioning Cabinets As I Probably Would Have Booked A Different Room.,,,,,
,396,Stayed In Room 17 Not Able To Secure Window To Enable A Small Amount Of Fresh Air Into Room Overnight.,,,,,
,398,Room Number 44. Lovely Room. Fab Selection Of Tea And Biscuits  As Someone Who Likes A Range Of Teas I Thought The Selection Was Outstanding  Keep It Up! Room Impeccably Clean  Housekeeping Staff Should Be Proud! ,,,,,
,399,Room 11...Much Preferred Being In The Main House Over One Of The Other Rooms. This Was My First Time There And It Was Handier For The Restaurant And Spa Area,,,,,
,403,Room Was A Bit Dusty,,,,,
,405,No,,,,,
,408,The Curtain In The Bedroom Was Very Badly Ripped And The Heating Kept Coming On Despite Us Turning It Off.,,,,,
,409,Room 89 Toilet Seat Loose  But This Is Only Nit-Picking.,,,,,
,413,We Stayed In Room 54 And It Was A Lovely Room  With Outside Seating Which We Would Have Enjoyed Had The Weather Been A Bit Warmer And We Had More Time.  I Liked The Wardrobe Set Up With The Sliding Doors.  ,,,,,
,414,058  We Really Appreciated The Unexpected Upgrade.,,,,,
,416,Room 67 - Was Very Comfortable,,,,,
,418,Room Number 4 Had Limited Chanel's On The Television Due To The Ariel Being Broken,,,,,
,419,74. As The Bathrooms Are Quite Small I Would Suggest Any Refurbishment Not Include A Bath  Just Walk In Shower.
Break With The Tradition Of Uk Hotels By Supplying A Small Fridge,,,,,
,420,No  Everything Was Fine.,,,,,
,422,Seemed To Be Noise From Water Cistern Throughout The Night  Which Was Disturbing.  Room 33,,,,,
,425,Decor Tired And Room No Where Near As Nice As What We Have Stayed In Before For The Same Price,,,,,
,429,Room 79 Comments As Before,,,,,
,430,Clean  Well Laid Out And Like The Balcony.,,,,,
,431,The Room Was Spotlessly Clean As Was The Bathroom. The Complementary Chocolates Were A Really Nice Touch Along With The Personal Greeting From The Manager. It Made Me Feel Valued Even Though I Had Only Visited Once Before.,,,,,
,433,Room 37 Is Our Favourite Room - We Love It.,,,,,
,435,The Bed In Room36  Needs Throwing Out It Was Slanted  Suggesting This Is Old And Very Uncomfortable. Not Good After A Relaxing Day In Spa. Defeats Object.,,,,,
,436,Room 43.  The Bedroom Decoration And Wardrobes Were A Little Tired.  The Bed Was Very Comfortable.  The Shower Was Very Poor (No Pressure) And We Preferred To Use The Showers In The Changing Rooms. Room Service Was Extremely Quick And Very Good.,,,,,
,443,Room 17 - We Were Very Disappointed With The Bath/Shower Which  At Best  Was A Light Shower And At Worst A Trickle - It Seemed That Water Pressure Was Very Poor And It Was Difficult To Get The Shower Connection To Not Revert To Filling The Bath - We Had Expected A Much Better Facility Than This.,,,,,
,445,No,,,,,
,449,On The Veranda Which Was Lovely There Were Alot Of Cigarette Ends Which I Would Have Expected To Be Removed,,,,,
,452,35/36 Inter-Communicating Rooms Exactly As Required.,,,,,
,453,Room 43. It Was Nice Having A Sofa In The Room To Relax.,,,,,
,454,Would Loveto Have Had A Fridge,,,,,
,455,Room 50 Very Noisy From Other Areas In Hotel Ie Other Shower And Toilet Flush,,,,,
,456,No,,,,,
,458,46. Safe Is Hard To Reach.,,,,,
,459,Needed More Milk Cartons And Shampoo / Conditioner,,,,,
,460,Very Enjoyable With Nice Outlook,,,,,
,461,Room 2 Upgraded Foc Due To Original Room Being Noisy As Next To Air Con External Units,,,,,
,463,Lovely Room Nice And Clean And Delight To Sleep In. ,,,,,
,465, Room 30.  We Are Already Familiar With The Garden Bedrooms Having Stayed Many Times Before. When Possible We Are Allocated The Room Of Our Choice And A Parking Space Which For Me As A Disabled Person Is Much Appreciated. ,,,,,
,466,We Stayed In Room 32 And Found It Comfortable With A Lovely Garden View.,,,,,
,468,55. A Fridge Would Have Been Good. The Bed Was Nice And Big And Comfortable. ,,,,,
,472,There Was A Fair Bit Of Dust About  Esp On Picture Lights And Above The Bed  It Was Clean But Not To A Standard You Would Expect From Such A Hotel.,,,,,
,475,The Room 85 Was Clean When We First Arrived But The Bathroom Was Not Properly Cleaned For The Rest Of The Stay  The Toilet Was Not Touched During The Days We Stayed I Almost Asked For Some Cleaning Products To Do It Myself.,,,,,
,477,We Had 76 77And 79  All Great Garden Rooms For Us Ladies.,,,,,
,483,The Sheets Were Marked And Slightly Dirty.,,,,,
,484,Really Pleased With The Room  We Upgraded Which I Would Do Again As We Were Disappointed With Our Room On Our First Visit With You.,,,,,
,491,Room 40 - Valance Was Dirty Around The Bottom Edge And Bottom Of Bathroom Door Was Chipped. Bathroom Looked A Bit Tired And Towel Rack Was Coming Away From The Wall. There Was Ketchup On The Arm Of The Armchair Which Went On My Jumper When I First Arrived And Sat Down.

Bed Was Very Comfortable And Room Was Light And Spacious  If A Little Corporate.,,,,,
,493,Room 40
We Noticed A Smell Of Stale Smoke In The Room 
It Was Quite Well Disguised But Nevertheless Unmistakeable
 I Felt The Furnishings Looked A Little Tired....,,,,,
,495,Room 42.  Great To Have All Our Party In Adjoining Rooms And The Rooms Were Really Lovely.,,,,,
,496,35 And 36. Room Could Use A Mini Bar Or Fridge . ,,,,,
,502,The Bed Was Lovely - Comfortable And Crisp Clean Bedding.
The Decor Was Very Tired Looking And Far From The 'Luxury Room' I Was Expecting.,,,,,
,506,59 Could Do With A Better Shower,,,,,
,508,The Room Was Fine Although I Would Have Liked A Mini Bar,,,,,
,509,No Perfect. ,,,,,
,510,We Were Told There Was A Safe In The Room. It Was Room 12 Of The Manor. It Didn't Seem To Have One Though So We Carried A Bag Around With Us The Whole Time!,,,,,
,514,Room 43 - A Full Length Mirror Would Be Useful  Surprised There Wasn't One. The Top Part Of The Bedside Lamp Stand Was Very Dusty  Noticed This When Sitting On Sofa. ,,,,,
,516,None,,,,,
,517,Large Room Well Above Quality International Size But Unimaginative Decor.

Could Be Considerably Improved ,,,,,
,522,Delighted To Have A Room Upgrade!,,,,,
,524,The Size Of The Bathroom Was A Little Disappointing For A Superior Room.,,,,,
,525,This Was The First Time We Had Not Stayed In The Manor   We Were Not Disappointed  Our Room Looked Out Over The Garden Room 32 Oakwood ,,,,,
,528,52 Loved Having Patio Onto The Garden,,,,,
,531,The Tv Was To The Far Side Of The Beds.. With No Arm To Move.. Badly Placed,,,,,
,534,33. A Corporate Feel To The Room - Which Was Reached Along An Unattractive And Shabby Corridor,,,,,
,536,The Dressing Gowns Smelt Of Chlorine And We're Ripped On The Neckline.
The Bed Linen Was Tatty And Pillow Were Flat And Did Not Fit The Cases.
The Bed Was Also Very Bumpy.
We Have Stayed This Room Before And Had A Better Nights Sleep.,,,,,
,537,The Room Was Clean However Incredibly Tired And In Need Of An Upgrade.,,,,,
,540,The Decor Was Tiring  The Rooms Need A Recur If You Wish To Charge The Premium Prices You Do,,,,,
,544,Room 92. Very Mean With Bath Products. Bed Valance Was Grubby. Wood Veneer Of Wardrobe Doors Had Come Away In Places. No Fridge. Uht Milk. For £286  Per Night We Expected More. Manager Said It Is The Going Rate For The Quality Of Hotel. We Don T Think So. It Would Be Interesting To See If You Ever Get Repeat Business From People Who Have Recently Visited The Hotel.,,,,,
,545,77. The Room Was Very Clean However Outside By The Patio Chairs Underneath My Window There Were A Lot Of Cigarette Ends.,,,,,
,548,84 Was A Very Nice Room With The Bonus Of A Balcony. The Only Down Side Was A Constant Low Hum From The Extractor Fan On The Ground Floor  Otherwise Very Good.,,,,,
,551,Room Number 67
Cob Web Above Bed In Corner And The Two Decorative Grey Pillows On The Bed Were Stained And Could Do With A Wash ,,,,,
,555,Room 17 - Bed Very Noisy On One Side,,,,,
,556,Some Shoe Cleaning Material Would Be Helpful. Pillows And Bed Were A Little Too Firm For My Liking.,,,,,
,561,I Liked To Outdoor Option,,,,,
,564,Room 46. Lovely  Large  Very Clean And Comfy. Also Close To The Spa Which Was A Bonus. Really Lovely Room.,,,,,
,566,Windows Dirty,,,,,
,567,Room 15
Poor Lighting I Couldn't Read My Paper ,,,,,
,568,Room 55.  Bath A Bit Small.  Walk In Shower Would Be Better.,,,,,
,571,The Quilt And Bedlinen Felt Very Used And Old And Needs To Be Renewed.
The Shower Was Very Weak With No Force In The Water Jet.
Room Number 31.,,,,,
,573,We Had A Lovely Ground Floor Garden Room.  It Was Clean But There Were What Looked Like Coffee Spillage On The Door Frame Of The Bathroom.,,,,,
,575,Real Ground Coffee Would Have Been Better. ,,,,,
,577,64.   Minor Niggle One Of The Screw On Caps To Panel Of Bath Side Was Missing Leaving Exposed Screw.  For This Level Of Hotel I Would Have Thought A Mini Bar / Fridge Would Have Been Expected.  Bed Very Comfortable And Spacious,,,,,
,578,No,,,,,
,581,Room 77. Couldn't Fault It. Everything In The Bathroom Worked. The Mini-Safe Worked. The Ground Floor Room Allowed Easy Access To The Garden Which Was A Lovely Sun Trap In The Mornings. If We Are Down Your Way Again I Would Definitely Ask For The Same  Or Similar Ground Floor Room On That Side Of The Accommodation Wing.,,,,,
,582,We Stayed In The Oakwood Suite 55 And The Room Was Excellent With Stunning View Of The Garden. We Always Book The Oakwood As We Know The Quality To Already Expect.,,,,,
,587,We Stayed In Room 66 - The Only Hiccup We Had But Didn't Mention Was The Family With Two Young Children Underneath Us. Being Woken By Crying And Squealing At 0730 Was A Little Annoying. Completely Not Your Fault.,,,,,
,591,Room 2 - Curtains Needed A Bit Of Care ,,,,,
,593,Fantastic. The Hotel Kindly Upgraded Us. Really Grateful.,,,,,
,595,Nice And Quiet Great View Of The Gardens From Our Room,,,,,
,602,Room 10  Lovely  Bathroom Small For A Suite  The Terrace Is The Winner  A Tip  Get Home Keeping To Spray Polish Along Top Of Curtain Poles And Swish Curtains Back And Forth  This Improves Glide So Your Curtain Won't Keep Coming Off The Rings.,,,,,
,604,Loved The Garden Room,,,,,
,606,A Little Bit Tired. In Need Of A Refurb.  However  Comfortable And Containing Good Amenities.,,,,,
,607,Room 33  As Above.,,,,,
,608,19 - The Quality Of The Bathroom Products Was Not Good As I've Had In Other Comparative Hotels.,,,,,
,609,As We Have Said Before We Would Prefer A Walk In Shower As We Find The Bath Rather High But This Has Not Stopped Us Returning To Room 77 ,,,,,
,610,41. Shower Was Not Very Powerful,,,,,
,613,Sadly The Bed Was A Joined Base And Two Beds Pushed Together Rather Than One Complete Unit Which We Both Found Uncomfortable,,,,,
,618,Extremely Comfortable Bed.
Although You Say You Can Provide Fresh Milk  Perhaps You Need To Look At The Options For Milk In The Room - I Have Stayed At Hotels Where The Longlife Milk Does Not Taste Of Longlife.,,,,,
,619,Comfortable Clean Bed Perfect Being A New Mum To A Six Month Old Baby Sleep Is What I Really Needed And Had A Very Comfortable Nights Sleep,,,,,
,624,Vey Disappointed With The Room - Please See Previous Comment.,,,,,
,627,No It Was Very Clean And Spacious.,,,,,
,628,Excellent Night's Sleep  Bedding And Pillows Of A Very High Standard,,,,,
,634,51-Lovely Spacious Room With Lovely View Over Well Kept Garden,,,,,
,636,Room 51.  Clean And Comfortable.  Standard Of Linens And Bedding Good.,,,,,
,639,Have Been Spending Breaks At The Hotel For Sometime Now. We Usually Have 3 Oakwood Rooms . This Last Visit Was Great  But Some Flowers/Fruit  In The Rooms Would Have Been That Extra Little Treat. We Shall You Again In July,,,,,
,641,Room 40 We Were Lucky Enough To Be Upgraded And We Thoroughly Appreciated It So Thank You. We Are Spoilt At Home By Having A Water Bed So Always Find Beds 'Differnet' To What We Are Used To But Good Nights Sleep Was Had.,,,,,
,646,Didn't Know How To Switch Standby Off On Television. Had A Blue Glow In Room All Night,,,,,
,650,Just Perfect. Really Really Comfortable And Welcoming. ,,,,,
,651,47  Would Have Been Nice To Have Some Bubble Bath.,,,,,
,656,No 78. Had Cigarette Butts On The Floor On The Seating Area Outside The Door. ,,,,,
,657,Room 67.  This Suited Us Perfectly And We Would Wish For The Same Room Or Similar When We Stay With You Again.,,,,,
,661,Room 55 - A Shame That The Bed Was Made Up Of Two Beds Pushed Together As The Join In The Middle Is Uncomfortable ,,,,,
,667,50 On A Gorgeously Sunny Weekend We Felt A Little Squashed In With Our Outside Seating Area. We Had No Outside Side Table  Unlike The Other Rooms Which Was A Shame. We Headed To The Central Communal Seating In The End To Give Us The Feeling Of More Space And This Was Lovely Although The Table Here Was Dirty And There Were No Cushions On The Seats Making Them Quite Uncomfortable.  ,,,,,
,668,N/A,,,,,
,669,The Bed Would Benefit From New Pillows. Also The Bathroom Would Benefit From A Greater Range Of Bathing/Cleaning Products.,,,,,
,670,30. We Were Delighted To Be Upgraded To A Garden Room. It Made Out Stay Even More Special. ,,,,,
,671,Would Prefer A Separate Shower And One That Unhooks,,,,,
,673,Our Room Was Large And Had A Lovely View Onto The Garden. The Facilities Were Very Good.,,,,,
,675,Comp Upgrade Was Kindly Given Which Made Our Stay More Special Than We Could Have Imagined It Was Very Special,,,,,
,679,5. Bed Was Very Comfortable. Perhaps The Carpet And The Sofa Are Wearing A Little Thin And Due For Replacing Soon. ,,,,,
,682,Insufficient Shower Gel And Shampoo For 2 People  Called Reception Who Rectified The Matter,,,,,
,684,Tv Was Small.,,,,,
,686,We Drank Our Welcome Sparkling Wine On The First Night And The Empty Bottle  Bucket And Used Glasses Were Left In Our Room For Two Days - Room 6,,,,,
,688,Room Was Nice,,,,,
,689,I'm Sorry I Can't Actually Remember The Room Number  How Ever It Was A Ground Floor Room  Near To The Guest Entrance To The French Restaurant.

A Couple Of Minor Observations.

The Tv Was Not Opposite The Bed  Nor Could It Be Adjusted (Pivoted) So That It Was More Central To Us On The Bed.

Led Lighting Above The Headboard Was Missing On One Side  So While The Effect Was Really Nice - It Was A Shame It Didn't Go Along The Entire Bed. It Has Made Me Consider Getting Some Of The Led Strips Though Since They Worked Very Well.

,,,,,
,691,We Were In Room 77 - A Great Room - The Only Issue Being The Fan Not Working In The Bathroom.,,,,,
,693,60 - Very Happy With The Room. Rubber Seal On Shower Screen Was Hanging Off But That Really Isn't A Problem,,,,,
,694,No,,,,,
,695,Room 12  Noisy Heater And Too Hot. ,,,,,
,698,Wi-Fi Not Wasy Or Good Quality Redeption,,,,,
,708,Room 5 

Fridge In Room Would Be Good,,,,,
,712,Knightwood 91. Lovely Room  Very Comfortable. ,,,,,
,713,Shower Was Poor And No Hand Held Shower Attachment ,,,,,
,714,The Room Was Quite Nosy At Night. Possibly From The Bathroom Fan Of Another Room Being Left On Or Noises From The Pool/Spa Complex. This Was A Little Unfortunate As It Slightly Spoiled The Overall Experience.,,,,,
,716,The Iron Did Not Work But Was Replaced When Requested. ,,,,,
,718,Room 88. A Fridge Would Have Been Handy.,,,,,
,719,Such A Shame That Claire From Reservations Felt The Need To Cancel Our Free Upgrade That Was Issued On The Internet Booking.,,,,,
,720,Room 41 The Bed/ Mattress Was Uncomfortable/Soft/Worn Out  Also Pillows Were Hard And With No Extras Available In Room  The Bathroom Products Were Minimal (Good Job We Brought Our Own) The Shower Head Was Very Poor And Needs Replacement As It Was Blocked,,,,,
,721,Was Very Spacious,,,,,
,723,Could Of Been More Milk For The Tea Lots Of Tea Bags But No  Milk  ,,,,,
,724,We Stayed In Room 44.   Your Cleaning Team Were Friendly And Professional.   When We Asked For Extra Products Such As Soap It Was No Problem To Them.   They Offered To Help With Luggage Etc And Made Us Feel Very Welcome And Important.    Thank You.,,,,,
,725,A Fridge In The Room Would Be Good - But A Mini Bar Is Not Necessary.,,,,,
,729,Lovely Towels But There Wasn't Enough Space On The Towel Rail So It Was Really Hard Work To Try And Hang Them Up!,,,,,
,733,Outside Table (On Arrival  A Good Sunny Day) Was Dirty Including Rings From Previous Drinks,,,,,
,734,No,,,,,
,739,Lovely Garden View From Room 80,,,,,
,740,Room No 44 Has Dust On The Bathroom Door Handle Plate,,,,,
,744,Room 52  Just A Couple Of Comments  I Would Have Liked To Have A Valence Covering Bottom Of Bed. The Curtains And Some Of The Cushions Had Some Not Very Nice Marks On Them. Cobwebs? But It Did Not Spoil Our Break.,,,,,
,745,Sorry Only The Hair In The Bath ,,,,,
,746,Room 77 With Its Outdoor Patio Area Was Well Appointed. The Only Downside Being That The Bathroom Fan Did Not Seem To Be Working.,,,,,
,747,20 The Only Comment I Could Make Was I Do Not Like Air Conditioning Noise But I Could Open French Door To Get Fresh Air Which I Prefer,,,,,
,748,Room 77. Extremely Comfortable Beds.,,,,,
,749,Not Cramped But Comfortable,,,,,
,752,Already Made Comments About Lack Of Mini Bar  Dvd Player Or Facility To Set An Alarm. Hangers In The Wardrobe Were Not Very Many And Hard To Hang Up.,,,,,
,756,Rm No 76. Lovely Room  Clean And Comfortable. Bathroom Products A Little Too Small For Two People On A Spa Break ( Frequent Showering Due To Treatments Etc). Nice Products But Samples Of Senspa Products Would Have Encouraged Us To Buy More From The Range.,,,,,
,760,Room Was Clean And Pleasant. Nothing Amazing Though. Reminded Me Of A Travellodge Having A Kettle On A Shelf In The Room. Perhaps Would Replace That With A Coffee Machine And Mini Bar.,,,,,
,762,11.  Bathroom Rather Small And Cramped So Not Particularly Comfortable Getting In And  Out Of Shower.  ,,,,,
,765,We Always Try To Book The Rosewood  Rooms / Manor Rooms / Garden Suite Which Are All Great And Well Appointed. It Would However Be Nice To Have A Minibar In These Rooms,,,,,
,767,Room 41  Was Well Prepared And Inviting As Usual. House Keeping Were Quick To Respond To My Request For More Pillows.,,,,,
,769,Room Was Beautiful And Could Not Fault It.,,,,,
,775,Room 50 - I Was Delighted To Have Been Given An Upgrade To A Room With A Sofa  It Made Our Stay So Much More Comfortable. The Only Comment I Can Make Is About The Fabric Covering The Sofa  Was A Bit Outdated.
,,,,,
,777,The Guard In Front Of The Large Window  Whilst Needed For Safety  Was Unsightly. Poor Design As The Door Did Not Open On To Anything E.G. A Balcony ,,,,,
,778,Lovely Room Very Pleased,,,,,
,779,No 74. Hate To Say Anything Negative But It Was Looking A Little Dated. Also Some Hair Conditioner Would Have Been Great.,,,,,
,782,It Was Lovely To Have Access To The Garden - Even If Wet - A Bit + The Bathroom Was Small And There Were Not Enough Hooks For Wet Towels / Robes / Costumes. Toiletries Nice But Not Enough For 2 Women!,,,,,
,783,Guide To Air Conditioning Would Have Been Useful  But As Said Ear;Ier This Could Of Been Me.,,,,,
,786,Bed Was Huge And Very Comfortable As Was Room,,,,,
,790,94  Room Was Dated But Very Clean ,,,,,
,792,Room 34  There Was An Almond On The Floor Underneath The Dressing Table  Which Obviously Had Been There From The Previous Occupant.  Not A Major Disaster  But Still Puts You Off A Bit.,,,,,
,796,I Found The Bathroom Small  For Someone Of My Stature  The Roof Terrace Could Have Done With A Good Clean.,,,,,
,799,Lovely Rooms! Lovely View Of Grounds.,,,,,
,801,37 - Light Bulb Needed Replacing Near Patio Doors,,,,,
,803,We Were Delighted To Discover That Room 10 Had A Roof Terrace Rather Than A Balcony As Was Indicated When We Advised On Line. However The Roof Terrace Had Not Been Cleaned For Some Considerable Time And When We Took The Liberty Of Having Tea On The Terrace The Cups Would Not Have Been Cleared If It Were Not For The Supervisor Paying A Visit.  We Did Not Have Our Complimentary Toiletries Replenished On The First Morning Which Meant By The Second Night We Had Run Out And Had To Ask For More.,,,,,
,804,45 - On Second Night Couldn't Turn Off The Air-Con  Eventually Rtealised That We Had Done It On First Night By Having The Balcony Door Open! Would Be Useful If There Was Brief Operating Instructions Within Room Folder.,,,,,
,810,Room 8 - The Bed Was A Little Hard For Our Taste And The Decor Could Do With A Little Freshen Up.,,,,,
,817,We Began In Room 65 - Please See Comments On Stay In General. We Were Moved To Room 51- Very Comfortable Bed. Large And Comfortable - Décor A Little Jaded. Nice Shower  Lovely Towels And Good Selection Of Products In The Bathroom.,,,,,
,818,Mirror On The Wall Was Too High For My Wife To Put On Her Makeup   Probly Needs A Make Over Soon,,,,,
,819,Not Enough Shower Gel Provided

Air Conditioning Would Have Been Useful,,,,,
,826,I Put Agree For The 3Rd Statement Only As The Tap In Our Bathroom Hadn't Been Fully Polished  Apart From That It Was Very Clean!,,,,,
,827,Room Number: 2  Up The Stairs Above The Reception/Lobby Area.
A Lovely Room With Space To Move! The Decor Was In Keeping With The Hotel Yet Still Offered Enough Modern Items To Feel 'At Home' ,,,,,
,829,As Mentioned In Initial Comments. Felt A Little Tired In Its Decor. Sufficient But Not Luxurious.,,,,,
,830,Room 42.  Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,831,Disappointed In Shower In The Bath  For Price Of Garden Room Thought Shower Would Be Better.,,,,,
,833,Room 1,,,,,
,834,Room 86 - Nice To Have A Working Safe For Peace Of Mind.,,,,,
,835,Itv Wasn't Working In Our Room But We Were Allowed To Use The Tv In Another Room,,,,,
,839,Personal Message In The Room Which Was Nice ,,,,,
,841,96 Knightwood. Carpet Worn In Areas  Window Difficult To Shut  No Air Conditioning  Fan Did Not Work In Bathroom. However  Bed Comfortable And Selection Of Tea/Coffee. ,,,,,
,842,Room 62 Very Pleasant. Lovely Outlook.,,,,,
,843,Very Happy With The Room  Lovely View Over The Gardens And Very Quiet.,,,,,
,847,We Transferred From Room 4 To Room 2 As Tv Was Not Working.  It Was An Excellent Sized Room And Very Comfort Able.  Just A Couple Of Things Which Could Be Better. 1) The Wardrobes Were A Bit Tired And Maybe Be Replaced In The Near Future.  The Toilet Did Not Flush Very Well And Needs Some Attention.  The Shower Spray Was Acceptable But Could Be Improved And The Water Drained Very Slowly From The Bath.  None Of The Mentioned Spoiled Our Stay In Any Way  They Are Just Suggestions For Improvement.,,,,,
,848,It Was Larger Than Expected. ,,,,,
,849,31. As Per Previous Comments  Bed Was Very Uncomfortable And Shower Was Awful. ,,,,,
,850,Worked Well For Our Purpose-Room 30. An Additional Single Bed Was Set Up-The Arrangments Met Our Needs Perfectly.,,,,,
,853,Thank You For The Chocolates And Note A Very Welcoming Touch Which Was Much Appreciated,,,,,
,856,I Especially Liked The Little Courtyard Area + Seating. The Bed Was Very Comfortable,,,,,
,859,Our Bedrooms Were Nice  We Always Have Oakwood Rooms.  ,,,,,
,861,The Room Was A Little Cold. The Quality Of The Shower Unit Could Do With An Upgrade. The Shower Facilities In The Female Changing Area Was Of A Better Standard. On One Of The Days We Did Not Want The Room Serviced And Received A Note From Housekeeping. The Text Is A Little Terse. ,,,,,
,863,See Prior Comments,,,,,
,864,Appreciated The Replenishing Of Tea/Coffee Whilst We Were In The Swimming Pool.,,,,,
,866,The Bedroom Was Lovely But Had Not Been Cleaned Properly As We Found Rubbish Left By The Previous Occupier And Also Cigarettes / Lighters Left Just Outside The Window / Door.,,,,,
,868,We Found Hairs In The Bathroom   Shower With Low Water Pressure And Tissues Behind The Side Table.,,,,,
,872,Rooms 31/32 - Delighted To Find A Connecting Door Between The Rooms.  

Disappointed With The Acoustics Between Room 32 And What I Assume Was Room 33 -  I Could Hear The Guest  Snoring!

We Were Pleased With The Prompt And Efficient Resolution Of Very Loud Music And Guests At Midnight Of Friday.,,,,,
,873,Room 96. Bedroom Lovely  Nice View Over The Gardens But Bathroom A Little On The Tiny Side.,,,,,
,874,We Were In Room 10 And The Patio Area Was Lovely But Had Cobwebs And Obviously Hadn't Been Cleaned In A While. In Addition The Table Wasn't Very Clean,,,,,
,876,Knyghtwood 84. The Room Unfortunately Was Airless Even With The Windows Open.  Having A Fan Available Would Have Enhanced The Quality Of Our Sleep.,,,,,
,877,I Think It Was 47 Number. It Was Spacious With Good Views Of The Garden.  It Was Clean As Well.,,,,,
,879,16. The Room Is Quite Small  Though It Did Not Feel Too Cramped. Ok For A Short Stay. The Shower Took A Long Time To Warm Up.,,,,,
,880,You Are Missing An Opportunity To Promote Some Of Your Spa Products By Failing To Provide Testers That The Therapists Use Or Would Entice Guests Who Don't Usually Try A Spa To Book A Treatment.,,,,,
,883,Room 33 - Could Hear Everything.,,,,,
,884,It Was Very Dated And We Were Quite Dissappointed,,,,,
,885,Room 80 - Initial Problem With Toilet Flush Mechanism - Reported To Reception - Staff Member Unable To Fix - Moved To New Room Following Day
Room 50 - Problem With Tv Remote Control - Found No Batteries Fitted - Reported And Batteries Supplied And Fitted Within 30 Mins,,,,,
,886,No Air Con. Generally Clean Apart From The Remote Control Which Was Very Dusty! ,,,,,
,887,Room 041  We Did Have A Rather Large Spiders Web By Our Window Which Must Have There For A Few Days Due To Its Size. Other Than That Room Was Lovely,,,,,
,888,Room 94  Just Felt A Bit Used And Well Worn  Bed And Pillows Not Very Comfy   Expected Better For The Money Paid ,,,,,
,889,93
Bathroom Room Door Creaked.
Pillows A Bit Too Soft. ,,,,,
,890,We Stayed In Room 12 Which Although One Of The Smaller Rooms  Had Lots Of Character And Lovely View Over The Gardens And Hotel Entrance. I Did Think The Room Was Looking A Little Tired And Might Be Due For Refurbishment Soon  But I Wouldn't Complain About It. The Bathroom Was Surprisingly Large For The Size Of The Bedroom And Was Very Clean And Bright  Thanks To The Mirrors. The Bathroom Was In Better Shape Than The Bedroom  I Thought.,,,,,
,891,Looking A Little Tired,,,,,
,895,Room Number 1. Would Have Liked Another Armchair.,,,,,
,896,Room No.: 77 -  One Of The Beds Had Been Made With Some "Washed/Scuntched Up Paper" In  So When We Pulled The Bedclothes Back There Was Paper Dust Everywhere. We Didn't Report It As It Was Fairly Late In The Evening And We Were Tired.,,,,,
,901,No 15. Have Made Comments On The Shower Previously.,,,,,
,903,Room 4 Was Excellent Although Not Sure The View Was As Described. This Was A Bit Disappointing Especially As There Was A Dead Bird Just Outside,,,,,
,906,Room 36. I Feel That The Room Could Do With A Facelift In The Decor. It's A Bit Seventies! But It Was Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,907,The Rooms Are Very Nice And Comfortable.,,,,,
,909,Perhaps More Modern Pictures And Decor  The Wardrobes Were A Bit Dated,,,,,
,910,Room 95.  Hair Slide Found On Floor Just About Under The Bed - Previous Occupant.  No Heat On - Had To Request Maintenance To Come And Look/Resolve.  Safe Was Not Working - Maintenance Had To Resolve.  Reported Drip In Toilet Cistern But This Was Not Resolved.  Irritating Every Time Toilet Flushed.  A Shelf In The Bathroom Would Have Been Really Handy As Limited Space To Place Toiletries.,,,,,
,913,Room 17 Was Very Clean And Tidy Although A Bit Smaller Than We Had Hoped ,,,,,
,915,We Were Given A Double Room To Begin With When We Had Asked For A Twin Garden Room. I Expected The Garden Room To Be On The Ground Floor But Was Told It Was Not So This Needs To Be Changed On The Website As It Is Misleading. The Staff Changed Our Room Immediately.,,,,,
,918,Room2 Well Pleased ,,,,,
,920,For A Superior Double Room  Again Back To The Décor  I Felt It No More Luxurious Than A City Centre Chain Hotel.,,,,,
,921,Room 67. A Lovely Large Comfortable Room And I Have To Say The Beds Are One Of The Comfiest Hotel Beds I Have Ever Slept In. Where The Room Is Located Makes It Peaceful With Regards To People Passing By And Lovely Views Of The Garden.,,,,,
,923,I Found The Pillows Uncomfortable. ,,,,,
,925,Was Nice To Get A Room Upgrade.,,,,,
,926,We Stayed In Room 87 Which Was Very Comfortable.,,,,,
,929,Room 40: Shower Good Have Been Better/Shower Head Cleaner.,,,,,
,933,Please See Comments Earlier Relating To The View Form The Room,,,,,
,934,Very Old Fashioned.,,,,,
,936,Was What We Requested And Very Pleased With It,,,,,
,937,18  The Garden Suite. Really Good Size  Especially As There Were Three People. The Windows Were Good For Us  Privacy Wise As No One Can See In  Therefore There Was No Need To Close The Curtains  Thus Giving Us The Lovely June Weather And Garden View All The Time. Loved The Bathroom. Nice To Have The Separate Toilet. Also Double Basins.
The Shower Was Good Too. I Deliberately Asked For Room 18 Having Stayed In It On Our Last Visit. ,,,,,
,942,Bed Was Okay  Not Amazingly Comfy,,,,,
,943,Room 19. It Would Be Nice To Have A Trouser Press And A Mini Bar In The Room
I Could Not Understand Why The Air-Conditioning Kept Going Off!,,,,,
,945,Missing A Mini Bar And A Trouser Press.,,,,,
,948,Room 42  Spacious And A Pleasant Room With A Pleasing Aspect Overlooking The Gardens. Room Well Laid Out With Essential Facilities Provided. A Very Functional Room And Well Lit.,,,,,
,951,62. Lovely Room. Clean & Spacious. ,,,,,
,953,Room 86 - We Were Very Pleased To Have Our Room Upgraded For Us And To Have Such A Spacious Room. The Decor And Furnishings Appear To Have Been Updated Since Our Previous Stay A Few Years Ago And We Noticed A Marked Improvement In The Overall Appearance. It Would Be Nice If The Hotel Provided Some Spa-Branded Products In The Bathroom Which Some Other Spa Hotels Do.,,,,,
,954,Maybe Have Mensu Inculded In The Cover Book In The Rooms Aswell As The Entrance. This Is Just To Make Things Availble And Not Having To Ask.,,,,,
,956,041. Felt The Room Was In Need Of Some Work. For Example  The Bath Had A Chip In It And Bathroom Door Was Quite Worn,,,,,
,957,Room 18 Air Con Stopped In Middle Of Night.,,,,,
,958,No Fridge Loads Of Room For One,,,,,
,959,Please See Previous Comments. Our Room Number Was 035.,,,,,
,961,Good Choice Of Coffee And Tea. Things Worked   Eg Tv Aircon  Which Frequently Don't.,,,,,
,964,Room 42 - I Did Find The Glass Shower Screen Rather Inadequate.  It Needs To Be Slightly Longer (Along The Bath) As The Water From The Shower Was Going Onto The Floor And I Felt I Had To Turn The Pressure Of The Water Down As I Did Not Want To Flood The Floor.,,,,,
,965,Room 51 Has A Rather Small Towel Rail,,,,,
,966,We Were In A 2 Bed With A Put You Up Third Bed  Would Have Been Nicer To Have A Proper Bed And Facilities For 3,,,,,
,969,Room 20. No Comments Only Praise.,,,,,
,971,One Of Bedside Cabinet Drawer Ears Had A Chocolate Bar Wrapper  I Pointed This Out Twice Before It Was Emptied.
The There A Rip On The Bed Linen  Not What Would Be Expected For £268/Hotel,,,,,
,972,These Days A Fridge In The Bedroom Is Expected In A 4 Star Hotel,,,,,
,973,Room 78..............The Room Was Spotlessly Clean Well Furnished And The Door Leading Onto A Small Patio Area Looking Onto Garden Area Was Fantastic!!!!,,,,,
,975,Little Old Fashioned ,,,,,
,982,Room 11.  Bathroom Products Could Have Been More Generous.  There Were Some Dried On Splash Marks On The Sink Cupboard And The Towel Rail Was Incredibly Dusty.  There Was A Pair Of Socks In One Of The Drawers Left By A Previous Occupant.  The Dried Flower Arrangement With Stones In Is A Dust Magnet - Get Rid.,,,,,
,984,Room 37. Was Just Lovely And Very Comfy. A Good Selection Of Tea And Coffee.,,,,,
,985,Could Do With An Update In The Not Too Distant Future.,,,,,
,986,No Mini Bar ,,,,,
,987,No 52. Please See Noise Remarks Earlier. A Very Noisy Room. Shame As Lovely Room Otherwise. ,,,,,
,988,No Air Conditioning A Major Issue At Time Of High Temp.Not Aware When Booked And Assumed Standard For Good Hotel.,,,,,
,989,We Had Rooms 54 55  And Either 53 Or 56. Mike On Reception  Informed Us We Had Been Upgraded And What Was Going To Be A Brilliant Stay Became Awesome. We Had Interconnected Rooms Which Was Wonderful When Getting Ready And We Were Able To Relax Outside All Together Drinking Champagne In The Sun. You Have Made A Lot More Wonderful Memories For Our Stay So Thank You!!,,,,,
,994,Room Number 4 Was A Bit Noisy As You Could Hear Everything Going On In Reception.,,,,,
,999,I Found The Sliding Door Arrangement Without A Balcony Interesting,,,,,
,1000,Room 60. Very Comfortable & Spacious. ,,,,,
,1001,The Room Was Lovely - Especially The Terrace. The Only Downside Was That The Tv Did Not Work. We Generally Listen To The Radio But It Was Disappointing. ,,,,,
,1004,Bedroom Suite Was Gorgeous! Lovely &  Spacious And Very Clean ,,,,,
,1008,Room 60 - Very Comfortable And Clean  Would Like To Have Had Ground Floor Room With Patio But Not Available / Offered At Time Of Booking. Bathroom Quite Small And Cupboard Very Annoying To Open / Close And Felt A Bit Cheap!,,,,,
,1010,Knightwood Room 20-  The Bed Was Extremely Spacious And Comfortable And The Room Was Light And Airy.,,,,,
,1011,Big Bed Was Fantastic,,,,,
,1014,We Missed The Small Set Of Drawers Under The Tv In The Bedroom. Room 20. A Full Length Mirror For The Ladies Would Be Useful.,,,,,
,1019,Room 90. Strangely It Seemed That The Bathroom Extractor Fan Was Not Always Operational. Not Sure Why But Things Got Very Steamy In The Bathroom In The Mornings. Not A Serious Problem Though.

A Fridge Would Have Been Useful As The Weather Was Extremely Hot. Again Not A Serious Issue For Us.,,,,,
,1020,The Mattress Needed Replacing As I Felt/Could See A Dip In It. ,,,,,
,1023,Nice Size Room And Bathroom Was Very Clean. No Air Con Was A Surprise In A Four Star Hotel As It Was A Very Hot Weekend So Sleeping Was A Bit Uncomfortable,,,,,
,1024,Great It Was Air Conditioned,,,,,
,1028,Room 18 Was Very Nice  The Bedroom Was Clean But Bathroom Was Not Spotless Toilet Floor Was A Little Grubby.,,,,,
,1029,Comfortable Enough And Great Size. Nice Bathroom Products And Everything Seemed Really Clean. Just Doesn't Reflect The Price Point Or Match Other Parts Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,1030,38 Unable To See In The Mirror When Using Hair Dryer Lead Not Long Enough,,,,,
,1031,57. The Private Verandah Was A Great Touch.,,,,,
,1032,Room 86.  As Previously Stated The Room Didn't Have A Fridge So We Couldn't Keep Drinks Cool Which Was Unfortunate As The Temperature Was 28 To 30 Degrees.  Also The Delivery Bay Arrivals Started At 5.30 Am Monday And Wednesday So What With The Heat  Lack Of Cold Water And Noise We Didn't Sleep Well.,,,,,
,1034,May Need Upgrading,,,,,
,1038,55 - Room Was Lovely And We Particularly Enjoyed The Access To The Beautiful Gardens. A Small Fridge In The Room For Milk And Water Would Be A Welcome Addition,,,,,
,1040,Room 90 
Definitely In Need Of An Upgrade,,,,,
,1043,The Free Upgrade Was Great - Air Conditioning Was A Bonus Especially With The Hot Weather The Week We Stayed,,,,,
,1044,See Above,,,,,
,1046,Room 18. Would Have Liked A Fridge In Our Room. ,,,,,
,1047,Room Was Lovely ,,,,,
,1049,Couldn't Fault It   We Stayed In The Oak Wood Suite   We Will Be Requesting Room 51 Again On Our Return Fab Room ,,,,,
,1050,No Air Conditioning ,,,,,
,1051,30 Stay In This Room 3-4 Times A Year Like Home From Home,,,,,
,1052,Really Loved The Turn Down Service  However Did Not Feel The Television Needed To Be Turned On Too. ,,,,,
,1053,47.  Whilst The Room Was Decorated To A High Standard  The Luxury Feel Of The Room Was Let Down By The Bathroom.  I Realise That There Is A Limitation Due To Size  But Having A Mediocre Shower Over The Bath And A Rubber Shower Mat Does Not Suggest Luxury.  There Must Be A Way To Produce The Wow Factor In The Bathroom With The Fixtures And Fittings On Market At The Moment.  Did Not Really Like The Extensive Use Of Mirrors In Bathroom Either.  We Used Showers In Spa As They Were Much Better.,,,,,
,1054,90  The Balconies Are Very Close Together So There Was No Privacy. The People Either Side Of Us Were Friends And Were Talking Over The Balconies.,,,,,
,1055,Products In The Room Were Limited  At The Price Bracket  I Would Have Expected A Fridge With Milk In Rather Than Uht (Thats B&B Style) And A Better Selection Of Toiletries,,,,,
,1056,It Is Impossible To Turn The Shower On Without Getting Wet Due To The Shower Glass.  Also You Need To Be A Contortionist To Access The Toilet Roll When Using The Toilet. Room 78,,,,,
,1057,Really Comfortable And Spotlessly Clean. Room96,,,,,
,1058,Very Tired And Not Fitted To The Standard Of Most 4 Star Establishments ,,,,,
,1062,Room 93- Ensuite Door Did Not Close- Layer Of Dust On Doors  Radiator And Tv- Cheap Iron Did Not Steam And Splattered On To Item When Used - Did Not Appear To Be The Standard Double Room That Was Requested Appeared To Be The Small Standard Room When Compared To Pictures And Description On Website- This Was Questioned When We Arrived In The Room,,,,,
,1065,51 Mini Fridge Great Size But Ice Cube Trays Starting To Go Mouldy. ,,,,,
,1066,Room 5. Great  Very Comfy Bed.,,,,,
,1071,Fridge/Mini Bar Needed,,,,,
,1072, I Was Not Sure If  The Water In Bathroom Tap Was Drinking Water? As We Did Not Have Enough Water To Have A Cold Drink And A Hot Drink  So More Water Would Be Good Or Advise As To Whether You Can Drink This Water In Bathroom.,,,,,
,1073,None  155/156/157. A Fridge In Each Room Would Be Nice But Not Essential,,,,,
,1074,Room 44 - Our Room Was Very Dirty On Closer Inspection. In The Morning I Stepped Out Of Bed Onto 2 Pieces Of Either Glass Or Thick Plastic (Which I Gave To Your Duty Mgr). When I Picked Up The Sharpe Pieces Of Glass / Plastic I Noticed A Brown Piece Of Food On The Floor - Just In Line With The Bed - It Had Been There So Long It Had Stained The Carpet ! My Husband Had Sneezed All Night Long & Thinking It Was A Unusual Pollen In The New Forest I Closed The Large Windows - The Sneezing Continued & In The Morning After A Very Restless Sleep For Both Of Us My Husband Suggested It Was Possibly Dust Related - Not Seeing Any Apparent Dust I Looked Up High & We Discovered The Lamp Shades / Light Bulbs Coated In Thick Dust  It Was Not A Couple Of Weeks Worth - It Was Several Weeks Or Even Months. With The Air From The Window Blowing It Must Of Disturbed The Dust Causing It To Fall Below On Us ! I Have Pictures If You Wish For Them To Be Sent But Your Duty Mgr Did Go To View This (Room 44)  I Don't Think Ours Would Of Been The Only Room. I Appreciate Not Everyone Is Sensitive To Dust Like My Husband - However I Don't Also Think It Is Something I Needed To Point Out Apon Check In. These  Issues Were Raised With Your Duty Manager On 28.07.14 - Approx 11Am And Subsequently Your Operations Mgr Ajit More Has Contact Me Saying If & When We Stay Again We Are To Ask For Him & He Will Ensure We Leave "Smiling" - What Ever That Means !! He Did Not Elaborate On How He Planned To "Make Us Smile" But It Was Clear Than In Order For Us To Be Left Smiling It Would Mean Us Spending More Money At Your Hotel  Something I Felt Was Quite Wrong. After Spending Approx £500 For One Night (Bed  Breakfast  Spa  Champagne & Flowers In The Room On Arrival Treatments  Food  Drinks Etc) We Would Not Be Prepared To Risk Staying Again. This Was Our Anniversary Treat Away From Running Our Business & Our 2 Children - Both Time & Money Are Precious To Us - We Had 26 Hours To Relax & Recharge - We Chose Your Hotel At Which To Do It At & Unfortunately We Wish We Hadn't. I Don't Think It Would Of Been So Bad But Both Senior Members Of Staff That I Have Spoken With Since Have Simply Offered Champagne / Spa Treatments & "To Leave Us Smiling" On Our Next Visit - Assuming We Would Be Prepared To Spend Our Money To Stay Again At Your Hotel. Very Disappointing. ,,,,,
,1078,We Were In Room 37  Branded A Garden Suite  It Was Not A Suite.  Not Even A Mini Bar.  Bathroom Was Small  Functional  But Hardly Spacious  Not Suitable For A Suite.,,,,,
,1080,Would Of Been Better If The Bath Had Side Taps So We Could Enjoy A Comfy Bath Together.,,,,,
,1081,We Were In Room 59.  It Was Spacious  Clean And We Loved The Position Overlooking The Garden.  The Weather Was Good And We Particularly Enjoyed Sitting Outside On The Chairs.  Very Minor Detail But One Of The Bulbs Over The Bed Needs Replacing (This Was Really Not A Big Deal Though!)  We Didn't Mention It As It Was Very Late When We Noticed It  On The 2Nd Night  And We Were Going To Sleep Anyway.,,,,,
,1082,Beautiful Room  Loved The Welcome Package.,,,,,
,1089,Room 5. Perfect Room For Us. Would Probably Like The Same Room If Ee Stay Again.,,,,,
,1094,Room 89 - The Room Did Feel A Bit Small.,,,,,
,1095,74... Bedside Lamp Wasn't Working And No Ordinary Plug Socket To Charge Phone That Side.,,,,,
,1096,We Had A Room In The Manor House And It Was Just Lovely! We Loved The Heritage And Decor Of The Building And Rooms. ,,,,,
,1098,Only A Couple Of Problems Faced Were Pillows While Comfortable Were Incredibly Soft And Didnt Support Neck And Heads  Also Water Pressure In The Shower Was Pretty Weak.
Room 11,,,,,
,1099,The Lighting Could Be Improved. All Led Bulbs Would Be An Improvement.,,,,,
,1100,Room 10 - Manor Suite: There Was An Issue With The Quality Of Room Servicing. Two Specific Examples Were  1; That We Had Asked For Fresh Milk On Friday When We Arrived (Which Was Brought Up Promptly) - The Half Full Milk Jug Was Still There In The Room On Sunday Morning Despite Being Well On The Way To Being Cheese!  2; On The Saturday Night - Wet Towels Were Left In The Bathroom Rather Than Being Changed As Part Of The Evening Room Service.  Also Despite Peter Getting The Aircon Fixed The Bedroom Area Was Always Too Warm.,,,,,
,1103,Loved The Anniversary Chocolates And Message  The Garden Room Was Lovely Where We Could Sit Outside,,,,,
,1104,Room 10 Very Special,,,,,
,1107,Room 66 - The Bed Was Very Comfortable - So Much So I Lifted The Sheets To See Which Brand It Was To Get One For My Own Home! The Black-Out Curtains Worked A Treat And The 'Quiet' Of The Room Was Exactly What I'd Asked For. Air Con Was Superb And Just What Was Needed After The New Forest Show. Lovely All Round.,,,,,
,1108,Very Limited On Shower Gel For Two People - One Little Pot Per Night Is Not Enough!
Recommend Also Having Larger Tv's - Most Hotels Do Nowadays.
,,,,,
,1109,We Were In Room 2...Stunning!  Couldnt Fault It.  The Only Thing Is We Want To Stay In That Room Every Time We Visit!,,,,,
,1115,Room 33. Beautiful Room. The Only Thing That Could Be Improved Is The Water Pressure In The Bathroom. The Toilet Took Several Flushes  And The Shower Was Not As Powerful As Those In The Spa Changing Rooms.,,,,,
,1116,Loved The White Company Soaps And Shampoos Etc!,,,,,
,1117,The Manor House Bedrooms Could Do We A Bit Of Modernisation But Don't Lose The Traditional Feel.,,,,,
,1119,Room 46  We Had No Hot Water On One Of Our Evenings ,,,,,
,1120,There Were Toothpaste Or Shaving Foam Splashes On The Bathroom Floor - I Got Rid Of These Before My Partner  Whose Birthday It Was  Saw. The Bottom Of The Bathroom Door Was Also Very Ragged And Looked In Need Of Repair Or Replacement.,,,,,
,1122,See Previous Re: Bath/Sink Plugs,,,,,
,1123,As Someone Who Runs A Mansion For A Living  I Do Notice Minor Details In Regards To Cleanliness. Room 8 Could Do With Having The Paintwork Washed Down  Especially In The Bathroom. If The Housekeeper Sits On The Toilet Seat To Look Around   They Will Then Notice What A Guest Would Notice. Weird Thing To Do  But Effective! Wardrobe Needs Vacuuming Out Too.

We Found A Pearl Earring On The Floor Too. We Left It On The Sideboard. ,,,,,
,1126,The Bathroom Was A Litttle Difficult To Move In With The Door Open  Not Easy To Navigate But Not The End Of The World. Room 38,,,,,
,1127,Room 18  Very Well Appointed. Cleaned Well And Comfortable.,,,,,
,1129,Room 90 - Bathroom Would Be Enhanced By Replacing The Plastic Basin With A Ceramic Version.,,,,,
,1131,Three Of Us Shared A Garden Suite Room And Paid £185 Each  Which We Feel Was Quite Expensive For That Room.  ,,,,,
,1132,Not As Clean As I'd Expect For Such A Hotel,,,,,
,1136,We We're Given The Wrong Suit On Arrival And Had To Be Moved,,,,,
,1142,79 Lovely Garden View,,,,,
,1143,Room 95. Bed Hard  Pillows Very Soft. We Both Had A Restless Night With Not Much Sleep. No Air Con In Room Meant We Had To Have Fan On,,,,,
,1144,Lacked A Stocked Fridge,,,,,
,1150,We Found The Mattress So Soft For Our Liking. Otherwise  We Found The Room Well Appointed.,,,,,
,1154,Room 40. The T.V Did Not Have Full Range Of Free View Channels. No Radio! Also T.V Could Be Larger And On A Swivel Bracket.,,,,,
,1155,We Were In Room 95 Which Looked Very 1980'S And Dated.  It Could Do With A Makeover. The Bathroom Was Fine ( Quite Like Those In The Langham  London) But The Bedroom Itself Was A A Bit Sad.,,,,,
,1156,Room 36 - Nice Room  Very Clean And Spacious,,,,,
,1164,We Noted That Three Wall Lights Were Not Working  Also One In The Bathroom On Its Way Out. The Problem Was Sorted By Replacing Two Bulbs In Bedroom But Third One Had To Be Looked At By Electrician  After We Had Left.,,,,,
,1165,The Bathrooms Are Starting To Look A Bit Shabby. The Safe Did Not Work Initially. A Light Bulb Did Not Work By The Dressing Table.,,,,,
,1166,We Were Upgraded As It Was My 60Th Birthday - A Nice Surprise.,,,,,
,1169,Excellent Room,,,,,
,1170,Just That The Room Was Far Too Warm,,,,,
,1179,Lovely Room Over Looking The Garden,,,,,
,1183,Room 8 - Great Room - Only Issue Was That The Air Conditioning Wouldn't Come On But To Be Fair We Didn't Really Need It.,,,,,
,1190,It Was Very Nice  Clean And Comfortable.,,,,,
,1193,Initially Given Room 91 - Was Disappointed Given We Were Staying For 6 Nights That We Didn't Have A Garden Room. Moved To 52 On The Monday Of Our Stay Which Was Much Better. Think The Tv Sets Should Be On Moving Plnths Since They Are Hard To Watch From Bed Where They Are Currently Situated,,,,,
,1195,No,,,,,
,1201,The Lighting Was Dim Especially For My 94 Year Old Father Who Can Not See Very Well.,,,,,
,1203,One Wall Light Was Not Working Which Did Not Really Matter And I Reported It To The House Keeper When We Checked Out.,,,,,
,1204,The Bathroom Was Too Small And Had Had Only 1 Washbowl.
I Don`T Like A Shower Which Cannot Take In My Hand,,,,,
,1205,Room 8.  Décor Very Nice  Classic.  Facilities Good But Shower Strength Very Poor.,,,,,
,1208,89,,,,,
,1210,Enjoyed Room 56 As It Was Possible To Sit Outside And Enjoy The Sunshine.,,,,,
,1212,Loved Sitting Outside The Room In The Evening Sunshine.,,,,,
,1213,Comment Cards And Health Questionnaires Were Missing. A Mini Fridge Would Have Been A Welcome Addition. ,,,,,
,1214,Spider In Bathroom  Otherwise Generally As Expected,,,,,
,1217,Very Small Bathroom. No Separate Shower. In Comparison To Other Local(Ish) Hotels Which Charge A Similar Rate We Found You Got A Lot More. It Appeared That The Bathroom Was Needing A Re-Furb.,,,,,
,1219,We Asked For An Upgrade And Yet The Room Had Smelly Carpets And Curtains.,,,,,

,448,Yes We Were Meeting Up With Friends,,,,,

,513,Because Of The Breakfast Wasn't That Great,,,,,
,515,Although We Were Told Our 8  Year Old Son Could Dine In The Dining Room When I Booked  When I Arrived At The Hotel An D Made A Booking For The Restaurant I Was Told He Would Not Be Able To Dine & The Receptionist Had To Ask The Manager. This Should Not Have Happened As I Was Told On The Phone He Could Eat In The Restaurant. As It Was We Thought It Would Be Too Formal For Him & Not Appropriate Amongst The Other Guests So Chose To Dine Outside The Hotel,,,,,
,522,Dined At The Sister Restaurant  Montagu Arms,,,,,
,529,Only That We Wanted The Chance To See A Bit More Of The New Forest,,,,,

,304,No There Was No Reason At All.,,,,,
,309,Time Constraints,,,,,
,316,We Used The Pool  Steam Room  Sauna And Jacuzzi Each Day - We Thought These Facilities Were Excellent. We Felt £35 Upgrade Per Person Per Day Was Excessive For The Facilities On Offer In The Senspa.,,,,,
,341,Used Gym  Pool Sauna That Was Fine,,,,,
,368,Both Of Us Had Been Ill  And We Didn't Have The Energy Or Inclination To Use It!,,,,,
,379,Meant To Just To Lazy  ,,,,,
,382,My Husband Used The Gym  I Could Think Of Nothing Worse Than Using A Spa  Its Really Not For Me At All  Ever!,,,,,
,385,Not Really A Spa Person,,,,,
,386,Have Done Spa Day Before. Thought Possibly Bit Expensive Given We Stayed In Hotel.,,,,,
,387,Given We Stayed In Hotel Thought £50 For Two Of Us For A Session Was Bit Expensive,,,,,
,389,Complicated Access Never Got Involved With The Form Filling Never Found The Gym,,,,,
,399,Not Bothered About Treatments,,,,,
,412,We Did Use The Pool  Which Was Beautiful And Impeccably Clean  However We Often Find We Don't Stay In Spas Long Enough For Them To Be Worth The Price. ,,,,,

,544,There Was An Unpleasant Smell From The Corridor Outside The Spa And The Pool Was Not Very Impressive. Whilst We Brought Our Swim Wear We We're Put Off. We Do Belong To Nirvava Spa In Reading And There Was No Comparison. Whoever Does Your Website Is Very Talented But It Does Leave You Feeling Disappointed With The Real Thing.,,,,,

,607,My Husband Used The Gym  Was Somewhat Disappointed With It  No Cross Trainer. I Did Not  Overwhelming Smell Of Room Fragrance  Which I Usually Like To A Degree But Was Far Too Strong. Did Not Like The Idea Of Going Across Concrete Floor From Room Through Bike Rack Area  Dark And Uninviting To Get To Spa. ,,,,,

,650,No Time  And We Had Used It Only A Few Weeks Beforehand. It's Fantastic By The Way And We Always Try To Use It And Really Enjoy It. ,,,,,
,654,Children Were Not Allowed Which Seemed A Little Unfair,,,,,
,656,No,,,,,
,657,We Used The Pool But Did Not Need Any Other Facilities This Time Round.,,,,,
,658,Idleness,,,,,
,662,No,,,,,
,665,We Were Staying With Our 1 Year Old Daughter Who Was Not Permitted In Any Of The Spa Or Leisure Facilities. This Was Known Prior To Arrival And Not A Problem But Use Of The Swimming Pool Would Have Been Nice,,,,,
,668,Forgot Our Swim Wear!!!!!!!,,,,,
,671,Short Stay And Not I Terested,,,,,
,674,The Weather Was Too Nice,,,,,
,677,No,,,,,

,700,Used The Swimming Pool And Jacuzzi But Not Any Treatments Due To Medical Reasons,,,,,
,701,Busy Out And Around The New Forest Area And Other Locations Around Southampton,,,,,
,708,No,,,,,
,718,Thought It Would Be Too Expensive.,,,,,
,721,Didn't Arrive Till Late And Already Had Reservations Book For The Evening Of We O Lying Stayed One Night ,,,,,
,723,As We Were Mis Advised On Transport And That We Could Use Conceirge Service A High Amount Of Moneyt Spent On Travel Abck And Forward So Sadly Could Not Afford The Spa In The End ,,,,,
,729,Weather Was Good On The Sunday So We Went For A Walk Then Used Hotel Pool / Jacuzzi. If It Had Been Raining We'd Have Used The Spa,,,,,
,731,Only One Night And Too Expensive,,,,,
,734,Pure Laziness - The Plan Was To Use The Spa But We Took The Opportunity To Do Absolutely Nothing For A Few Hours  Which When You Have A 5 Year Old Is A Real Treat!,,,,,
,737,Not There Long Enough,,,,,
,744,No  Just Did Not Get Around To It.,,,,,
,745,Not Enough Time ,,,,,
,755,Not Interested,,,,,
,757,No Time.

,762,No,,,,,
,771,Used The General Leisure Activities...Pool  Steam Room Sauna And Jacuzzi,,,,,
,776,We Used Swimming Pool And Jaquesie,,,,,

,785,To Busy Maybe Next Time,,,,,
,797,No,,,,,
,810,Just Not Our 'Thing'.,,,,,
,821,No  We Were Happy With The Gym And Pool,,,,,
,823,Undergoing Chemotherapy  Not A Good Idea Due To Risk Of Infection.,,,,,
,838,We Were Happy To Use The Leisure Facilities As That Was Adequate For Our Needs On This Occasion. However If We Return With More Time To Spare I Think We Would Use The Spa,,,,,
,839,Wife Is Heavily Pregnant ,,,,,
,842,Lack Of Time And Planning On My Part But Wish To Enjoy The Senspa In The Not Too Distant Future With Friends. ,,,,,
,846,Too Infirm!!!!,,,,,
,847,No Ran Out Of Time.,,,,,
,849,Leisure Facilities Were All We Needed.,,,,,
,850,We Were Only Staying For One Night And Ran Out Of Time.,,,,,
,851,No Time,,,,,
,852,The Weather Was So Good We Wanted To Be Outside. We Did Use The Pool.,,,,,
,857,No Time ,,,,,
,863,Not Enough Time,,,,,
,876,We Were A Little Short On Time And Wouldn't Have Been Able To Make Best Use Of All That It Offered.  We Just Use The Pool/Jacuzzi Etc Which Was Lovely.,,,,,
,884,No,,,,,
,888,Didn't Have Time ,,,,,
,895,Old Age.,,,,,
,898,Couldn't Be Bothered 
,,,,,
,904,Not Enough Time As It Was A Beautiful Day So Wanted To Be Outside .,,,,,
,912,Happy With Swimming Pool  Sauna  Steam Room And Jacuzzi Facilities. Intended To Use Gym But Didn't Quite Get Round To It.,,,,,
,918,Had No Time As We Took In Local Sights,,,,,
,921,We Left It Too Late To Make A Booking + I Forgot My Swimsuit To Use The Pool And Spa Facilities.,,,,,
,933,No,,,,,
,936,The Other Facilities Were More Than Adequate  If We Had More Time Staying We Would Have,,,,,
,940,Family Vacation And Our Daughter Not Allowed As She Was Under 16.  I Knew This When I Booked The Room  But Still Disappointing.
When I Visited The Spa They Seemed To Push The Added Features.  I Only Wanted A Swim.,,,,,
,943,No Time This Occasion,,,,,
,945,Time,,,,,
,946,Not Really Run Out Of Time,,,,,
,961,No Interest In Spa Facilities,,,,,
,962,Time Restrictions - My Stay Was Only For 1 Night.  Also  The Spa Was Not Of Interest To Me.,,,,,
,964,Cost,,,,,
,972,As Previously Stated  My Wife Was Taken Ill And We Shortened Our Stay As A Result. We Had Intended To Try Out The Senspa,,,,,
,980,Not Really.  It Was A Short Stay And Lovely Weather And We Were Happy To Out Of Doors,,,,,
,988,Not Aware Of Additional Charge  Or Part Of Other Packages,,,,,
,994,No  As The Weather Was So Good We Made The Most Of Being Out And About.,,,,,
,997,We Were With Other People And We Simply Didn't Have Time  As We Went Cycling.,,,,,
,999,Yes We Stayed With Friends Who Were Pleased To Visit Southern Hampshire It Was Not Our Intention To Use The Spa,,,,,
,1011,The Normal Leisure Facilities Were Sufficient For Our Requirements.  Sauna   Steam Room Etc All Great  If A Bit Tired In The Décor..But This Did Not Detract From The Experience In The Slightest.,,,,,
,1018,Not Really My Or My Wife's Scene.,,,,,
,1019,I Have Never Used A Spa So Don't Know What To Expect.,,,,,
,1020,The Cost Of Staying Overnight Plus Treatments And Use Of The Senspa Was Prohibitive.,,,,,
,1030,Too Expensive,,,,,
,1031,Lack Of Time / Opportunity...And The Initial Reason For Booking Was Just Location  Not The Spa.,,,,,
,1034,Holiday,,,,,
,1042,Didn't Want To Waste A Lovely Day In Doors,,,,,
,1044,No Time,,,,,
,1047,No Not For This Trip,,,,,
,1052,Really Not Enough Time  Our Offer Only Extended To Our Checking Out Slot   And We Were All Working The Day Before. Perhaps Easily Obtainable Info Of The Additional Cost Of Using The Hydrotherapy Area Would Entice More Customers To Make Use Of The Spa  With This Special Offer? I Could Not Find Any Info On Line  And When Phoning It Took A While To Get Through To Departments  I Simply Ran Out Of Time To Make The Arrangements  And Online I Could Have Just Clicked Away. ,,,,,
,1065,Treatments Expensive,,,,,
,1067,Yes  My Daughter Was With Us And Being 14 Years Old She Was Not Allowed To Use The Pool. We Were Made Aware Of The Hotel's Policy At The Time Of Booking (Ie Exc Under 16'S)  But We Did Find The Policy Somewhat Frustrating.  ,,,,,
,1069,No,,,,,
,1073,We Were Busy At The Beach With The Children. Having Stayed With You Three Years Now  And Our 3 Grandsons Are So Well Behaved It Would Be An Absolute Bonus If We Could All Use The Swimming Pool. I Know That It Is Attached To The Spa But Other  Hotels Have A Children's Hour. I Am Sure That Other Guests Would Understand  And I Can Assure You That None Of Our Grandsons Are Likely To Tinkle In The Pool!,,,,,
,1084,We Did Plan On Using The Spa On Our Check-Out Day - Unfortunaely Your Officious Receptionist Put Us Off Spending Any Extra Time At The Hotel.,,,,,
,1086,No,,,,,
,1101,We Never Use Spas.,,,,,
,1104,Enjoying The Other Facilitys I E Afternoon Tea And Champange On Traceys Birthday.,,,,,
,1107,Time Constraints Only.  Wanted To But Will Have To Ensure I've Got Enough Visiting Time To Sneak In A Treatment ,,,,,
,1109,Not Enough Time....But Will Do Next Time,,,,,
,1117,Pool And Sauna Where Enough.,,,,,
,1129,As You Didn't Not Allow Children.  I Can Understand That The Hotel Is  Predominately For Adults But A One Hour Period Per Day Where Children Were Allowed During School Holidays Would Be A Small Concession And Most Welcomed By Families. ,,,,,
,1145,Too Busy Doing Other Things Although Had Planned To.,,,,,
,1151,The Weather Was Good And Was Out And About And Able To Relax In The Garden.  Would Use Spa Next Time,,,,,
,1155,Not Enough Time,,,,,

,----------------------,,,,,,
,1,The Manager Of The Restaurant Presented Us With The Cork From Our Bottle Of Champagne That We Had Bought For Our Engagement And He Had Put A 20Pence Piece In It For Good Luck Which Was A Really Nice Touch. ,,,,,
,2,The Food And Service Were Out Of This World. Just Wished We Could've Tried The Manor Restaurant Aswell.,,,,,
,3,We Ate At 9Pm In The Manor Restaurant. Personally I Found The Lighting Too Bright  Far From Romantic And Again Very Warm. The Seating Arrangement On Each Table Was A Little Strange But I Guess It Enabled You To Sit Closer To Your Partner. Sadly Again The Overall Presentation Is Very 80’S And Would Maybe Suit Those In Their 50’S.  The Staff Were Attentive But In Some Cases Too Attentive.  One Of Our Waiters Must Have Come To The Table Almost Every 5-10 Minutes And Didn’T Come Across Very Genuine.  Possibly He Was New To The Role But I Didn’T Warm To Him Even After Hearing His (Slight Sob) Story About Missing Dorset. Hope That Doesn’T Sound Harsh. The Meal Itself Was Ok But Nothing Outstanding And Slightly Overpriced. For £100 We Had The Cheapest Bottle Of Wine On The Menu  2 Main Meals And 2 Deserts. The Main Meal Was Ok But The Deserts Were Pretty Un-Exciting. Both Very Vanilla And Could Of Gone Without To Be Honest. Coffee In The Bar After The Meal Was An Experience Listening To The Bar Manager Argue With Guests About Where They Could And Couldn’T Spend Their Dinning Allowance. Seemed Very Unprofessional Sending Them To Another Bar Only To Be Sent Back Again.     ,,,,,
,5,Waiter - Tall Male - Accent - Rude. He Treated Us As If We Shouldn't Be There. We Complained About A Drink Being Overly Alcoholic And He Lectured Us On The Contents Of A Strawberry Dacquiri And Begrudgingly Took It Back And Then Presented Us With A Vodka Lime And Soda With No Vodka In It. When We Told Him This He Huffed Off And Came Back With A Glass With A Quadropole Shot Of Vodka And Tipped It In The Glass! Coupled With This Was That We Ordered Rice With Our Meal That Never Came. The Other Waiter/Waitresses Were Fine But This One Ruined The Whole Experience. I Would Have Created More Of A Scene And Complained About Him If There Were No Other Diners Present. He Embarrassed Us And Tainted Our Whole Experience. Neither Of Us Rated The Food Really But That Was Probably Down To Our Poor Choice More Than Anything Else. We Have Had Thai Food Elsewhere That Has Been Better And More Vegetarian Options Available Too. Would Never Eat In Zen Garden Again.,,,,,
,9,Continental Breakfast Slightly Disappointing As Previously Mentioned,,,,,
,12,The Fruit Cake And Scones Which We Ordered For Afternoon Tea Could Have Been Better - The Cake Had Been Refrigerated Which Was Odd And The Scones Were Rather Stodgy. Dinner In The Zen Restaurant Was Delicious However  As Was Our Lunch At Le Blaireau. The Staff In The Zen Restaurant Were Not Particularly Helpful When We First Enquired About Having Afternoon Tea And Made Something Of A Meal Of Needing To Check With The Chef First. If Afternoon Tea  Even Just Tea And Cake Need To Be Pre-Ordered This Should Be Made Obvious Somewhere For Spa Guests To See. ,,,,,
,14,Delicious - Love The Paris Street Scene!,,,,,
,15,It Was Fine. Nothing Special And A Little Pricey  Especially The Wine. Nice And Close To Our Room Mind You!,,,,,
,16,See Previous Comment Box On General Experience. Could Have Been A Far Better Experience All Round.Not Satisfied. ,,,,,
,17,I Have Already Spoken To The Duty Manager At The Time About This And Filled Out A Comment Card. ,,,,,
,25,My Husband Joined Us At The Last Minute For Dinner  And The Staff Were Very Happy To Accommodate This.,,,,,
,27,See Previous Comments About Decor  Ambience And Pianist,,,,,
,30,Food In The Zanspa Was Excellent Could Not Falut It...Vefry Good Value For Money Aswell Food In The Restaurant Dissappointed As Mentione Deralier Steak Was Very Poor Quality Meat,,,,,
,32,Some Of The Soft Furniture In Blaireaus Seemed To Have Had A "Hard Summer" And Probably Should Have Been Attended To  Or Removed  As Whilst Enjoying Pre Diner Drinks I Did Question What The Meal Would Be Like Based Upon The State Of The Sofas.,,,,,
,34,The Food In The Zen Garden Was Great. The Food At Le Blaireau Was Poor. The Staff In Both Restaurants Were Polite And Helpful.,,,,,
,36,Disappointing Dessert Selection In Comparison To Rest Of Menu  Tried The Chocolate Pudding But Very Dry.  The Decor In The Restaurant Was Not On A Par To The Standard Of The Food ,,,,,
,39,Starter Was Not As Described On The Menu - Fried Seabass Was Actually A Salad! And With Virtually No Seabass But A Huge Amount Of Small Pieces Of Lime Peel. You Are Meant To Use The Juice Not The Peel Which Overtook The Entire Dish. And Yes  I Eat A Lot Of Thai And Have Visited Thailand 8 Times So Honestly It Was Off The Mark. Mains Were Ok - Heavy On The Sauce And Lacked The Freshness And Zest They Should Have. I Can Only Assume Many Guests Live Locally To The Area And Haven't Eaten Decent Thai - Don't Mean To Be Rude But The Reviews Are Surprisingly Good And It Doesn't Match Up To Them. Zero Ambience.,,,,,
,40,Waitress Got One Of Main Courses Wrong But We Carried On Regardless,,,,,
,41,We Have Eaten At Blaireaus On Previous Visits  But This Time The Food  Service And Ambience Was Outstanding.,,,,,
,42,See Comments On First Page,,,,,
,43,A Return Booking Is Anticipated,,,,,
,49,The Food In The Evening Was Amazing  However We Also Felt That The Menu Felt Very Much The Same Compared To When We Stayed 3 Years Previously.,,,,,
,53,Room Service Experience Was Very Poor  The Number Was Engaged All The Time  When I Finally Managed To Get Though Gentlemen On The Other Side Speak Very Little English. The Food Was Simply Awful – Pork Burger Was In Fact Canned Meat And Brownie Was So Old I Could Barely Put My Fork Though It. ,,,,,
,57,My First Choice Of Main Wasnt Available Which Was A Shame.,,,,,
,58,We Felt That The Service Was Maybe A Little Slow To Start In The Zen Garden  The Restaurant Was Busy So Maybe That Was The Reason.,,,,,
,61,The Lady Who Took The Orders  Was  Very Unfriendly And Behaved Like  The Guest Where A Inconvenience Our Waiter Was A Very Nice Guy But Very Neverous  Of The  Manager Taking The Orders  We Where Given A Tale Right In The  Corner Facing A Fire  Escape  And The  Clearing Station I Asked To Move  As There  Where Lots Of Free Tables In The  Middle  Again The  Head  Waitress  Was Unfriendly And Siad They Where  Busy Tonight I Wass There To 11Pm And The  Tables  She Spoke  About Where  Never Used The Menu Read  Well But Diapointed  My Lamb Was  Ok And My Wifes Beef  At £26 For 3 Thin Slices  Was  Poor  At Best Would  Never  Eat There Again,,,,,
,66,It Was Lovely To See The Return Of A Cheese Selection  To The Menu In The Manor Restaurant And The Vegetarian Menu Looked Great.,,,,,
,67,Anna Was Great As Always Made Us Feel Very Welcome The Deserts Was A Big Let Down  Normally The Deserts Are Great But We Tried 3 Different Deserts And All A Big Let Down With Some Not Being Cooked Fully Or Just Not Nice Tasting. Maybe The Chef Was Having An Off Day As We Have Never Had Any Bad Food Before. ,,,,,
,68,Amazing Food And Service In Both Restaurants.,,,,,
,70,Excellent Service And Food At Le Blaireau. Thoroughly Impressed With All Aspects Of Meal- Especially Ambience Waiters Created On A Very Quiet Evening! 10/10!,,,,,
,71,Beautiful Food That Was Truly Amazing And A Delight To Eat....Never Had Such A. High Standard Of Food  Truly Amazing.,,,,,
,72,Slow Waiter. Great Good. ,,,,,
,73,All The Food Was Just Sublime.,,,,,
,77,Eat Lunch In Zen Garden. Lovely Food But Service Was A Little Slow And We Had To Keep Asking For Our Drinks And Other Items That We Wanted. Not Very Attentive.   Dinner In Le Blaireau Was Lovely And The Staff Very Friendly. ,,,,,
,81,Fabulous For And Service In Both Thai And French Restaurants.,,,,,
,82,As Previously Mentioned Regarding The Female Restaurant Manager. ,,,,,
,84,Very Happy With Both Meals That We Had. Thank You,,,,,
,92,Food Was Excellent  Cannot Fault It At All. There Were Moments Of Awkwardness During Service  Were The Whole Place Seemed Overly Professional To The Point Were Ourselves And The Other Guests Felt It Rude To Even Talk! Also Tables Are Located Very Close Together - We Would Have Preffered A Little More Privacy.,,,,,
,93,As Previously Noted. The Food Seemed Expensive On First Site But When We Received Our Meals We Felt That It Was Good Value For Money - The Meals Were Delicious And Of A Very High Standard. The Only Comment I Would Have Regarding The Food Would Be That We Went To Have Lunch Quite Late In The Zen Garden On The Second Day And Had Only A Choice Of A Sandwich For £8 Or A Salad For £15!  We Couldn't Afford To Spend That Much On Lunch So Had A Smoothie Instead.  Perhaps It Would Be Nice To Have One Or Two Cheaper Options For Those That Are Staying As A Treat And Have Already Spent Their Budget On The Main Stay And Treatments?,,,,,
,96,Cannot Praise The Standard Of The Food Enough  Very Good Dining Experience,,,,,
,97,We Cannot Praise The Food High Enough - Fantastic Cooking And Presentation,,,,,
,98,The Staff At Breakfast Were Slow To Clear The Table. When We Went Up After Our Fruit To Have The Cooked Breakfast We Returned And Had To Remove The Used Plates To A Side Table Ourselves.,,,,,
,99,Great Food  Surprised At The Standard Considering It Was Included As Part Of A Spa Package.,,,,,
,103,Manor Restaurant Decor A Bit Dated,,,,,
,104,Maitre' D On The Night Was Excellent And We Invited Two Friends From Poole To Dine With Us Who Were Also Impressed With His Style And Friendly Approach,,,,,
,105,See Earlier Coments,,,,,
,106,Simply Some Of The Most Exquisite Food That Have Ever Passed My Lips! I Have Eaten In Some Very Good  Award Winning Restaurants Before Now But This Has To Rank As The Top Two If Not Number One.,,,,,
,109,Excellent All Round,,,,,
,110,Fried Eggs At Breakfast Were Not Nice. They Had Been Sat Warming Too Long. It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had Them Cooked To Order.,,,,,
,113,Both Restaurants Were Good The Only Issue Was The Billing Of Our Meals And Drinks,,,,,
,115,The Dining Room Seemed A Little Gloomy. It Was Quite Difficult To Read A Newspaper At Breakfast.,,,,,
,117,Very Impressed With The Zen Garden But Bit Disappointed With The Manor Unfortunately. The Breakfast On The First Night Was Held In The Zen Because Of A Big Christmas Party Which Was Fine But The Breakfast Wasn't Great (We Both Had A Full English) On The Second Morning Breakfast Was Held In The Manor And I Wanted To Order Smoked Salmon And Scrambled Eggs But There Wasn't A Choice (It Was However On The Menu The Morning Before When We Had To Dine In The Zen!) So Again Chose The Full English But Again It Was Quite Unsatisfactory. The Bacon Was Very Hard And Sausages Tough. Grilled Tomato Was Nice Though! In Hindsight  I Would've Liked Salmon Or Eggs Benedict But Again There Wasn't A Choice On The Second Morning Whereas It Was There On The First! We Dined In The Zen On The First Night And The Manor On The Second But Unfortunately Menu Wasn't Very Extensive And My Bf Had His Heart Set On The Fillet Steak But None Was Available. A Bit Gutting As It Was His Birthday.,,,,,
,121,Always So Friendly And Professional. Very Happy To Move Us To Another Table When I Was Very Warm After Visiting The Spa.,,,,,
,129,The Restaurant Was Uncomfortably Hot But The Food Was Excellent.,,,,,
,138,Wonderful Food And Service Both In The Thai And In The Manor Restaurant,,,,,
,139,Enjoyed Having Our Coffee And Cheese In The Lounge By The Log Fire,,,,,
,140,Very Relaxed And Comfortable. Staff Extremely Attentive.,,,,,
,143,Felt A Bit Rushed To Start With! ,,,,,
,146,Don't Bring Out Food Which Hasn't Been Ordered As 'Compliments Of The Chef',,,,,
,149,Enjoyed Every Mouthful,,,,,
,150,Boxing Day Gala Banquet Was Disappointing - Portions V Small And No Cheese Course! Band - Not Very Good Selection Of Tunes ,,,,,
,152,We Particularly Enjoyed Our Meal In Le Blaireau  And Chatting To The Staff There Was A Delight.,,,,,
,153,Staff Were Busy So There Were Times When We Had To Ask Several Times For Things They Had Forgotten To Bring But Understandable Given The Time Of Year.,,,,,
,154,The Food And Waiting Staff Were Superb.,,,,,
,157,As Comment Before Lacking Music.,,,,,
,159,The Manor Restaurant Is Always First Class.   Completely Seemless And Totally Indulgent.  Its Fine Dining At Its Best.  The Zen Is Very Good  The Food Is Always Vibrant And Fresh.  The Only Disappointment Was That We Didn't Realise The Christmas Eve Meal Was Not Included In The Christmas Break Cost  Only An Allowance At The Zen.  If We'd Have Known  We'd Have Eaten In The Manor Restaurant As Booked Initially.  It Needs To Be Made Clearer In The Brochure Maybe?,,,,,
,160,This Is Referring To Breakfast Which Is Excellent. The Variety And Most Importantly The Quality Of The Food On Offer Is Superb. Notable Mentions To The Sausages  Bacon And The Honeycomb Honey.,,,,,
,163,This Was The First Time We Had Used Le Blaireau. We Liked It. The Manager Was In Charge And The Staff Friendly. The Food Was Good But Not Exceptional. We Like The Zen Garden. We Would Like To See The Return Of The Healthy Menu (Missing This Visit). Staff Friendly And Professional. We Had Breakfasts Every Day In The Manor And Christmas Lunch And Dinner On Christmas Day And Boxing Day. Breakfasts Are Great. The Christmas Lunch Was Fine. The Fish Buffet On Christmas Night Was Exceptional. The Dinner On Boxing Day Night Did Not Hit The Spot For Us. We Would Have Preferred A Choice Of Starters And Desert: No Problem With Choosing This In The Morning. Also There Was A Delay After We Had All Sat Down For Dinner - Did Something Go Wrong In The Kitchen? The Reception And Canapes Were Excellent. ,,,,,
,164,On A Couple Of Occasions My Food Was Cold  So Had To Be Sent Back,,,,,
,165,Absolutely Excellent  However The Quality Of Service At Dinner Deteriorates As The Restaurant Fills With Diners And The Wait Between Courses Extend S At Times  To Unacceptable Intervals - One Hour On One Visit - And This Mars The Overall Experience,,,,,
,166,Boxing Day Dinner Perhaps A Little Slow,,,,,
,168,Probably That Boxing Day Dinner Was Not As Good As Previous Two Years,,,,,
,169,At Breakfast The Plates Hot Food Were Sometimes Cold ,,,,,
,171,Dined In The Manor Restaurant Previously And Partly Why We Booked Again To Stay At Careys Manor. Service Was Ok  (There Were Very Few Diners) Food A Little On The Sparse Side Particularly The Starters  Desserts Disappointing.  The Cheese Board Was Dreadful  Tiny Tiny Portions Of Very Dried Up Cheese.  We Mentioned To The Waiter That They Were Hard And Not Very Nice  He Took Them Away And Came Back Saying The Chef Said The Cheddar Is Supposed To Be Hard Without Any Offer To Change Them Or Offer Alternatives. As We Were Entertaining Guests Chose Not To Pursue This At The Table But Ended An Average Dining Experience To An All Time Low.,,,,,
,174,The Seafood Buffet Was Great. My Only Comment On Service As  With Only 3 People At The Table I Expect Staff To Remember Who Ordered What  And This Didn't Seem To Happen. Sommelier Was Attentive And Knowledgable,,,,,
,176,We Love Thai Food And Visit Thailand Often. ..  The Food Here Is Authentic And Delicious. ... Our Experience At The Zen Restaurant Was A Huge Plus In Our Stay,,,,,
,180,Our Groups Only Minor Complaint Was The Quality Of The Coffee Served Did Not Live Up To The Overall Experience  Cold And Very Weak. This Could Have Been Caused Due To The High Volume Of Customers All At One Time.,,,,,
,183,The Best Food I Have Ever Eaten. The Pork Belly Starter Was Phenomenal.,,,,,
,184,No,,,,,
,185,Attentive And Excellent Service  Without Being Over Bearing,,,,,
,186,See Above!,,,,,
,187,We Were Especially Impressed With The Quality Of The Food On New Year's Eve With The Number Of People Being Catered For.  Compliments To The Chef And His/Her Staff.,,,,,
,190,We Always Dine At Carey's When We Are In The New Forest.,,,,,
,191,The Seafood Buffet On New Year's Eve Was Totally Exceptional And Must Be Repeated!!,,,,,
,192,The Best Thing About The Food Was The Free Gift From The Chef Of A Courgette And Thyme Cappuccino. The Starters And Main Course Were Bland. Dessert Was Ok.,,,,,
,193,See Above,,,,,
,201,No,,,,,
,210,Good Food And Wine  Knowledgeable Staff.,,,,,
,212,I Had Room Service For Dinner And Although The Food Was Lovely The Portions Were Very Small  Particularly The Starter. I Ordered Smoked Salmon That Included Crab But I Asked For It Without Crab. I Would Assume That Additional Smoked Salmon Would Be Provided As A Substitute But This Was Not The Case. So Very Tiny Amount Of Salmon On My Plate!,,,,,
,214,See Previous Comments.  The Waitresses At Breakfast  In The Overflow Room  Looked Bored  Moved Slowly And Didn't Clear The Half Eaten Breakfasts On The Tables Either Side Of Us Throughout Our Entire Breakfast.  When We Asked For Fresh Coffee Because What We Had Was Awful We Had To Find Our Own Clean Cups.  There Were Only 2 Or 3 Tables With Salt And Pepper - We Were Not One Of Them!,,,,,
,215,No,,,,,
,220,Grit In Mussels  Slow Service And Corked Wine ,,,,,
,221,Only Your Coffee Was Not Good.,,,,,
,222,I Am Not A Fan Of Buffet Dining  So I Would Have Preferred Waiter Service For Breakfast And Also The Seafood Starter At The New Year Dinner.  I Think It Is Unacceptable To Queue For A Buffet When Dressed For A Black Tie Event.,,,,,
,224,Breakfast And Dinner We Had At The Zen  We Had Problems With Working Out What Meal Was In Our Package And The Desert Was Very Late.,,,,,
,225,The Staff Were All Very Friendly,,,,,
,226,Additional Items For Breakfast Were Brought Out To The Table Before We Had Finished Our Cereals! They Were Going To Leave Them On The Table Until We Pointed Out They Would Get Cold!! Solution - Bring Out When Actually Starting Or About To Start Cooked Breakfast The Window Sills In The Manor Restaurant  Where We Were Sitting  Were Full Of Dust & Had Not Been Cleaned,,,,,
,227,Manor Restaurant Was Delicious  Zen Garden Disappointing In That It Was More Chinese Rather Than Thai,,,,,
,230,Le Blaireau's Menu  Although Changed Since Last Time Could Really Do With A Bit Of A Revamp.,,,,,
,233,Exceptional Cuisine. New Years Eve Food Out Of This World.,,,,,
,234,My Husband Didn't Like The Duck Main In The Zen Restaurant  Thought It A Bit Bland But I Loved My Cashew Chicken. ,,,,,
,236,The Staff Were Very Attentive,,,,,
,237,None  I Actually Liked The Thai Resturant So Much That I Ate There Twice! It May Just Be One Of The Best Thai Resturants In The Counrty (And Ive Eatten At A Lot),,,,,
,240,Great Food But Overpriced Compared To Other Hotels,,,,,
,246,Nice Waiting Staff But Professionalism Was Dubious. ,,,,,
,247,Had Morning Coffee In Le Blaireau.   Had A Child With Us Visiting.   No J2o Available For Him,,,,,
,248,Hanna Was As Charming As Ever  As Were All The Staff. I Have Already Mentioned The Menu  But Because The Hotel Was So Quiet  Even Though We Dined With You On The Friday Evening  It Was Very Quiet And Lacked Atmosphere. All The Diners Were Located In The Far End Of The Dining Room Near The Windows  But It Really Was Sole Less ,,,,,
,249,Just Excellent,,,,,
,254,With A Large Function Going On  The Night We Stayed (Saturday 11Th January) I Feel The Food Service Was Compromised In The Manor Restaurant. Our Waiter Was Excellent But Sadly Let Down By The Food Being Very Slow To Come From The Kitchen. Tables That Started Their Meals Over An Hour Later Than Us Where Served Their Desserts At The Same Time. We Waited Over 40 Minutes For The Starters. We Had The Set Menu - 2 Guests Did Not Have Dessert But Requested Coffee Instead. We Were Informed Coffee Would Be Charged For  Sadly The Weak Coffee That Was Served Was Undrinkable. It Was Changed To Two Cups Of Much Stronger. Maybe You Should Review The Cafetiere Style Coffee - A Lovely Idea But When Served So Weak Is Unacceptable.  ,,,,,
,255,Could Have Done With Larger Portions.,,,,,
,256,Busy But Excellent In All Respects. 100% Happy With Our Meal And The Zen Garden ,,,,,
,257,Too Many Bookings  Chef Didn't Appear To Be Able To Keep Up With Orders  Long Delays ,,,,,
,258,The Only Comment Is Regarding The Zen Garden  I Think It Is Overpriced - £1.50 For 2 Biscuits And £15.95 For A Greek Salad Is Somewhat Expensive.  I Also Think Yon The Juice /Smoothie Menu That You Mention Yogurt Is Added  I Had The Melon Smoothie And Unfortunately Found Out After I Ordered That There Was Yogurt In It  And I Find It Difficult To Digest (Something To Do With The Enzymes In It).,,,,,
,259,We Had Booked Our Table Online For A Meal At 8.15Pm  However When We Arrived There Was No Booking For Us.  We Then Had To Wait Until Almost 9Pm To Be Seated.  We Weren't Even Offered A Complimentary Drink Whilst We Had To Sit In The Bar.,,,,,
,265,I Was On A Set Menu And I Think That The Choices Were A Bit Limited. Drinks At The Bar Were Quite Expensive Breakfast Was Very Good.,,,,,
,268,Excellent Food  Good Service - What More Can You Ask For?,,,,,
,269,Massively Too Expensive.,,,,,
,272,We Waited Quite A While To Be Served Our Drinks And Bread  I Work In Hospitality And Would Always Ensure Guests Are Attended To As Quickly As Possible With These 2 Things  Then They Are Happy To Chat And Peruse The Menu. Also A Bit Mean With The Bread  The Rolls Were Lovely But Small  The Men In Our Party Asked Twice For Additional Bread  This Is Not An Expensive Item To Increase Diner Satisfaction  Please Offer More Freely. One Of Our Party Was Also Gluten Intolerant  Despite Advising The Hotel Of This 3 Days Prior To Arrival  She Had To Wait For Every Component Of The Meal That Had To Be Made Specially  Bread Etc  She Got A Bit Tired Of This By The End. That Said  The Food Was Superb  Every Element Was Perfect  A True Testament To An Excellent Chef And Team In The Kitchen.,,,,,
,277,We Had To Leave A Day Early Because Of A Family Emergency So Missed The Manor Restaurant. The Blaireau Was Good But The Restaurant Felt A Little Cold (Not Very Many Diners That Night.),,,,,
,279,Food Was Gorgeous!,,,,,
,280,We Both Thought The Food And Wine Were Fantastic.,,,,,
,282,I Can Only Repeat That The Food Was Exceptional And The Staff Friendly And Very Attentive,,,,,
,283,The Waiting Staff Were Friendly  Professional And Knowledgeable About The Menu.  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. Thank You. ,,,,,
,284,Even Though The Food In Le Blaireau's Was Amazing We Felt It Was A Expensive And Had We Been Staying For Longer Than One Night Would Not Have Been Able To Eat There Again.,,,,,
,285,No,,,,,
,287,Food And Service Excellent. Slight Mistake When Serving Incorrect Wine But Dealt With Well With Apologies,,,,,
,303,See My Earlier Comments Re Booking & Thai Food Expectation. Thai Food Was Good But The Experience Poor. ,,,,,
,304,We Left Early And Did Not Finish Our Last Course Due To The Restaurant Was To Cold And We Did Not Feel Comfortable And Had To Retire To The Bar In The Hotel For Drinks To Warm Our Selves Up.,,,,,
,306,The Food Was Amazing And The Staff Were Very Attentive. The Restaurant Had A Lovely Ambience And We Liked That The Tables Were Nicely Spaced To Allow Some Privacy.,,,,,
,309,Both Members Of The Restaurant Looked After Us Very Well  They Listened To Our Needs And Made Us Feel Special,,,,,
,310,As Stated Previously   Food Wonderful Service Impeccable. ,,,,,
,313,Staff Were Very Efficient And Helpful  Cheerful! Food Was Cooked Perfectly. Overall Fantastic! ,,,,,
,316,I Wasn't Keen On The Standard Of Coffee Supplied With Breakfast Or The Latte Which I Tried On Arrival. A Smoother Blend Would Appeal More To My Taste.,,,,,
,318,The Dining Room Didn't Have Much Of An Atmosphere But I Was In Very Good Company So This Didn't Bother Me Too Much. The Service Was Very Professional But Sometimes Felt A Bit Over Formal (For Me Personally). ,,,,,
,320,Staff Were Excellent. Food Was Great,,,,,
,326,Please See Original Comment ,,,,,
,331,Our Booking For Our Afternnon Tea Went Missing On The System.. So Had To Ask For It To Be Booked Again... And Really Wanted To Have It In The Lounge Area.. Not In The Zen Garden As The Smell Of Thai Food Whislt Waiting For Afternoon Tea Was A Little Off Putting.. As We Did Go Into The Lounge Area First To Wait For Our Afternoon Tea And Saw The Table Set Up It Looked Really Lovely All The English Tea Set And Plate's.. And Rose's Put Into A Vase. And Then Got Told To Make Our Way To The Zen Resturant  And It Just Was A Bit Of A Let Down To Be Honest. And It Was So Overpriced For What We Recieved.. 
£17;95 For 5 Small Finger Cut Sandwhich's Between Two People? Very Odd..,,,,,
,333,Breakfast Lovely And Cocktails Nixe In Bar. Staff Very Courteous Especially Front Of House Man Behind Desk. ? Porter And Cleaning Lady Who Was Very Helpfull With Info Ref Room Types,,,,,
,336,The Chicken Satay Was Exceptional!,,,,,
,342,We Normally Eat In The Manor Restaurant But Decided To Have A Change.   Le Blaireau Was Perfect,,,,,
,344,The Manor Restaurant On The Friday Evening Was Superb.  Excellent Food And Service; Also In The Adjoining Bar Area Before And After Our Meal.  We Also Thoroughly Enjoyed Listening To The Pianist Throughout The Evening.

We Also Very Much Enjoyed Our Breakfast And Lunch On Saturday In The Zen Garden With One Exception.  We Had The Starter And Main Course As Part Of The Included Two Course Lunch; Excellent Food And Excellent Service.  However  We Also Decided To Have A Dessert Which We Ordered.  After Half An Hour Of Waiting And Being Unable To Catch The Attention Of Any Of The Staff I Had To Get Up And Advise One Of Them That We Would Not Wait Any Longer As We Wanted To Get Back To The Spa And So  Therefore  Had To Cancel The Order.  This Was A Very Slight Disappointment In An Otherwise Marvellous Experience.  ,,,,,
,345,Room Was A Little Too Warm And Stuffy ,,,,,
,346,As Explained Before The Food Was Cold,,,,,
,350,Service In Le Blaireau Could Have Been Quicker.,,,,,
,355,The Service Was Outstanding On Le Blairaeu As Was The Contact And Organisation Prior To Us Dining. We Were A Party Of 14 And We Per Ordered Our Meals  No Mistake Were Made With Our Order And The Food Was Exceptional. Please Read My Previous Comment With Regards To The Zen Restaurant. In Addition We Felt The Food Was Not Good Value For Money In The Zen. ,,,,,
,361,Menu Would Benefit From A Selection Of Larger Salads For Those Who Don't Want Rice/Noodles. Beef Salad Was Delicious   But Too Small For A Main.,,,,,
,364,Our Dining Experience Was Fantastic. The Food Was Delicious  Gorgeous In Presentation And The Service Was Exceptional - Everyone Is So Friendly!
The Complimentary Cauliflower Mousse Was A Nice Surprise.
Compliments To The Chef!,,,,,
,368,The Responses In Section 15 Apply To The Manor Restaurant.,,,,,
,374,The Dinner And The Breakfast Was Excellent  The Light Lunch Ok,,,,,
,377,The Only Let Down Was The Buffet Breakfast Was Cold And Dried Out.,,,,,
,378,The Zen Garden Was Nice  But For The Blaireau  The Welcome Was A Bit Over The Top  And Food Was Poor.,,,,,
,383,Thai Food Lovely.
Le Blaireau Food Was Amazing. The Service Was The Best I Have Probably Ever Had  Lovely Guys - More Than Helpful!
The Manor Restaurant - Breakfast  Laid Out Perfect And The Food Was Brilliant.,,,,,
,385,For Such A Nice Hotel It Was Spoilt By Having A Buffet Breakfast. Although Fresh Food Was Brought Out Regularly We Still Had To Hang About Waiting For Certain Items To Appear.,,,,,
,386,Tried To Select 3 Different Wines But None Of Choices Were Available,,,,,
,387,Not Good Having Dead Flowers All Around Restaurant (Due To Subcontractor Not Removing Apparently  But Thought Staff Might Do). Selected 3 Wines From List And All Were Unavailable.,,,,,
,389,We Were On Restricted Winter Warmer No Choice Did Not Alter We Upgraded Made It Expensive.,,,,,
,392,The Meal In The La Blaireau Was Excellent. Staff Were Welcoming And Knowledgeable As Well As Being Attentive But Not Over-Ally So  ,,,,,
,393,Dinner Was Perfect,,,,,
,398,Cannot Praise The Catering Staff Enough. Flawless And Fantastically Personal Service Throughout. ,,,,,
,402,I Thought The Meal Was Poor Value For Money.,,,,,
,403,Zen Room Was Very Warm ,,,,,
,405,Prices In The Zen Have Risen!,,,,,
,406,I Wanted A Scallop Noodle Dish But Was Told This Couldn't Be Accommodated And I Could Only Have What Was On The Set Menu.,,,,,
,408,The Zen Garden Food Was Delicious However When I Told The Waiter I Couldn't Eat Anything Spicy He Informed Me That The Thai Kitchen Is Spicy And Therefore It Would Be Tricky To Guarantee An Unspicy Meal.  I Did Have An Unspicy Meal And It Was Delicious So He Made Me Feel Embarrassed And Fussy Without Any Need.

The Manor Restaurant Was Excellent As Was The Service.

We Weren't Too Impressed When We Ordered Bar Snacks And Received A Total Of  Chips!,,,,,
,409,Sadly Our Booking Was Not On The Dining List  However The Member Of Staff Who Booked On Our Behalf Verified Our Booking. Staff Were Very Busy And The Food Over Priced.,,,,,
,410,The Restaurant Manager Was The Most Efficient And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble The Italian Lady Was Also Lovely ,,,,,
,411,Even Though The Food And Service Was Very Very Good We Felt That The Ambiance In The Dinning Room Felt A Little Conference Like And Not As Intimate As We Were Hoping  ,,,,,
,412,We Found The Restaurant Relaxing With A Lovely Ambience. The Food Was Excellent And The Staff Very Friendly. ,,,,,
,413,We Dined In All Three Restaurants.  We Had Lunch And Afternoon Tea In The Zen Garden And Our Breakfast In The Manor Restaurant.  I Think Our Favourite Food Was In Le Balireau On Saturday Evening  As Our Sweet Course Was Fantastic.  I Had A Rhubarb Cheesecase And My Daughter A Chocolate Mousse And They Were Outstanding.,,,,,
,414,At Breakfast  I Would Have Preferred The Jugs Of Fresh Milk To Be Chilled (As At Home) As The Dining Room Wasn't Busy  I Wondered How Long They Had Been Sitting There - Just A Small Point.,,,,,
,417,Would Have To Nice To Have A Food Allocation Amount Rather Than Set Menu.,,,,,
,420,Breakfast Wasn't So Good. The Buffet Was Great But The Waitress Who Took Our Order Forgot The Eggs On One Order  And Only Brought One Poached Egg When 2 Were Ordered .
By The Time The Other Eggs Arrived We Had Eaten The Rest.
We Also Thought The Dining Room Needed Updating. It Was A Bit Dated.,,,,,
,422,Really Appreciated The Glasses Of Champagne As It Was My Birthday - Nice Touch.  Was Nice That Both In The Senspa And The Bar/Restaurant  The Staff Wished Me Happy Birthday.,,,,,
,425,Service In Mannor Was Better Than Zen  The Decor In The Mannor Was A Bit Of A Dissapointment But Food In Both Locations Was Very Good. ,,,,,
,430,Superb.

Le Blaireau Was Fantastic.  The Service And Food Was Amazing!

Thai Lunch Was Great.

Afternoon Tea - Only Comment Would Be Too Many Cakes.  We Would Have Preferred More Sandwiches And Scones To The Cakes.,,,,,
,431,Dinner Was Sublime And Amongst Some Of The Best Thai Food The Pair Of Us Had Ever Had! The One Exception Was The Waiter Was Quite Abrupt When I Asked If I Would Require A Side With My Main. My Partner Even Commented On It. He Soon Cheered Up When He Saw We Had Left A Tip! This However Is My Only Negative Point And The Rest Of The Waiting Staff Were Excellent.,,,,,
,433,We Felt The Music Was Too Loud And Thought Jazz Was A Strange Choice To Play During Dinner And Breakfast.,,,,,
,436,The Decoration Of The Manor Restaurant Was A Little Old Fashioned.,,,,,
,443,Breakfast Was A Little Disappointing - Self Service Meant That The Food Was Warm Rather Than Hot And The Toast Machine Slow And Frustrating. Okay To Help Yourself To Cereals  Fruit Juice Etc But It Would Be Nice To Order Hot Food To The Table. Fish And Poached Eggs Ordered One Morning Were Very Good And Hot.,,,,,
,445,Excellent Service Food And Piano Playing. ,,,,,
,446,When I Booked My Break I Also Booked The Zen Restaurant For An Evening Meal And The Lady Asked If There Where Are Dietary Requirements.  I Have An Allergy To Onions And She Assured Me That This Would Not Be A Problem.  When My Husband And I Went For Dinner I Ordered Chicken Satay Followed By Chicken With Cashews And Again Asked That Neither Dish Have Onions.  My Satay Starter Was Served With A Salad Containing Onions.  When Told  The Waiter Apologised And Took It Back To The Kitchen.  It Was Then Given Back To Me Minus Any Salad (Apparently This Is Pre-Prepared).  When My Main Dish Was Served This Again Contained Onions!  Once Again It Was Taken Away And An Apology Given.  Whilst I Appreciate That The Waiter Gave Us Complimentary Tea And Coffee At The End Of The Meal  It Was Disappointing That Both Of My Courses Were Not As Requested.,,,,,
,450,The Food Was Pretty Good Although A Bit Expensive For What It Was.,,,,,
,452,Change The Menu More Often !,,,,,
,453,We Were Disappointed With The Breakfast. It Would Have Been Nice If The New Forest Breakfast Had Been Freshly Cooked.,,,,,
,454,The Service In The Manor Restaurant Was Much Better Than Zen Garden Where We Had To Remind Staff That We Wanted Coffee And Had To Ask Where The Buffet Was.,,,,,
,455,Nothing Special Limited Choice,,,,,
,456,While The Basic Ingredients Were Good The Food That We Had Was Actually Poorly Prepared Even At A Basic Level In Terms Of Taste  Texture And Seasoning. Zen Especially. Breakfasts Were Excellent.,,,,,
,457,Service Was Quick (But Unhurried)  Friendly & Helpful.  The Food Was Imaginative & Delicious.,,,,,
,460,I Will Definately Use The Restaurant Again When I Am Staying In The Area,,,,,
,463,Great Good Lots Of Choice. ,,,,,
,465,Lovely To See Anna Again As She Always Gives Good Service And Is Very Friendly.,,,,,
,466,Lovely Food In The Restaurants And Professional Service,,,,,
,467,See Earlier Comments.,,,,,
,468,While The Food And Service Was Good  We Wouldn't Say It Was 'Exceptional'. Staff At The Restaurant Knew Which Package We Were On So Could Direct Us To The Correct Menu Which Saved Any 'Awkwardness'.,,,,,
,472,The Head Waiter  Or Restaurant Manager Was So Helpful  Made Sure We Had Everything And Made Great Conversation  So Even If I Found The Main Dishes To Rich  Which Is The Same With All Thai Restaurant  So No Reflection On Yours  The Head Guy More Than Made Up For It  And We Had A Great Time There.,,,,,
,475,Our Dining Experience Was Not Good  We Waited An Hour For Our Main Course And When It Arrived The Pork Rib Was Very Tough  The Kale Inedible And My Husbands Bream Was So Tiny It Was Barely There  Thankfully It Had Linguini With It Or We Would Have Had To Go Elsewhere To Eat.  We Did Mention That The Pork Was Too Tough And They Kindly Adjusted The Bill Re. Drinks And The Prawn Starter  That Too Was Pretty Tasteless Which Was Amazing As You Cant Usually Go Wrong With Prawns  Garlic And Olive Oil.,,,,,
,483,Outstanding.,,,,,
,484,The Staff In The Manor Restaurant Were Excellent.,,,,,
,487,As Stated Previously  Disappointed That In The Restaurant When We Ordered Mussel Were Told No Available.,,,,,
,488,See Other Comment About Booking System!!!!,,,,,
,490,Use The Same Bakery For Breakfast You Use In The Le Blaireau.
Thai Meal- The Chicken With Cashew Nuts Had No Nuts And Looked More Like Pad Thai Rather Than Chicken With Cashew Nuts. However It Did Have A Good Flavour. We Have Had Lunch In This Restaurant Before With No Complaints. ,,,,,
,491,Whilst The Dining Room Was A Bit Like A Corporate Function Room (We Were In The Second Half Of The Room And The Only Guests For Some Time  The Food Itself Was Exceptional. My Partner And I Eat In Top London Restaurants Frequently And Both Felt That The Taste And Presentation Could Easily Compete With Many Of The Michelin Starred Restaurants We Eat At. Please Pass On Our Compliments To The Chef - The Venison In Particular Was Outstanding. The Pinot Noir Was Also A Really Great Dinner Wine And The Service Was Professional And Attentive.,,,,,
,492,Disappointed That The French Restaurant Was Booked Out Entirely On The Second Eve,,,,,
,495,Service Was Sometimes Slow In The Zen Garden At Lunchtime  So We Sometimes Had To Rush To Afternoon Appointments.  Also The Main Course Portions Are Quite Big  Especially When You're Spending The Afternoon Being Massaged Or In The Pool.  The Food Itself Was Really Fantastic.,,,,,
,496,The Pamper Day Menu At The Zen Hasn't Changed In A While,,,,,
,503,Food Was Not Quite 'Fine Dining' But Still Very Good. Not Exceptional Though.,,,,,
,505,Food And Service At Le Blaureiu Was Not Good. We Would Not Go Back There. Didn't Find The Menu Particularly French  There Was Very Limited Options If You Didn't Want To Eat Meat Or Cheese  The Service Was Very Slow Despite There Being Plenty Of Wait Staff. Twice I Had To Get Up And Walk To The Counter To Get Something We Needed For The Table. ,,,,,
,508,The Thai Restaurant Was Lovely  The Food In The French Restaurant Was Not Very Good And Over Priced Compared To The Thai Restaurant ,,,,,
,509,Dining Experience Was Top Notch.  With Polite And Courteous Staff.,,,,,
,510,They Were A Bit Short Staffed And We Had To Wait Quite A Good While To Order. We Did Not Mind.  They Realised This Was Happening As They Had So Many People And Room Service To Deal With So They Kept Us Happy With Popadoms. A Nice Touch.
Always Love The Zen Garden My Favourite Thai Restaurant I Know Of!,,,,,
,516,Dining Experience Excellent With A Comfortable And Professional Manner. ,,,,,
,520,Although The Food Was Excellent And Service Very Good The Restaurant Lacked Atmosphere.,,,,,
,524,The Manor Restaurant Claims A Dress Code With No Denim. There Were Two Tables Dining At The Same Time As Ourselves Where One Of The Diners Was Wearing Jeans. Clearly The Dress Code Is Not Being Enforced Which Is A Great Shame.,,,,,
,525,We Would Have Liked Some Lamb On The Menu. The Wine Selection Was Excellent   As Were All The Staff ,,,,,
,528,Le Blaireau Was Our Favourite.  Felt Like Being Abroad On Holiday,,,,,
,533,Very Much Enjoyed Pianist Otherwise See Overall Comments,,,,,
,534,The Room Was Entered Through Large Empty Spaces And Was Itself Devoid Of Atmosphere.
I Was With My Mother And  As So Often When There Are Two Women  We Were Not Given A Good Table Whereas The Couple Who Came In After Us Were Given A Window Table,,,,,
,535,The Service And Food In The Thai Restaurant Was Excellent.  The French Restaurant Was Acceptable But The Service Was Slow  We Had To Ask For Things Multiple Times  My Steak Was Over Cooked But Overall It Was Ok But Could Be Much Better.,,,,,
,536,We Dined Here As We Couldn't Get Into Zen Restaurant.
The Service Started Well And Ended Poorly.
The Restaurant Was Just Not Running Smoothly .
,,,,,
,540,The Zen Garden Was Excellent  The Breakfast Was Ok  But The Service Slow And The Replenishment Of Products Poor. Le Blaireau Service Was Good  But Sadly The Food Quality Was Just Not What We Expected. It Was Acceptable  But Not Exceptional,,,,,
,544,I Can Find No Fault With The Staff Or The Food. You Have A Very Good Chef . Carpet On The Other Hand Was Grubby. Wouldn't T Normally Matter But For The Price To Stay At The Hotel It Should Matter!,,,,,
,545,I Would Love The Recipe For The Polenta Sausage Meal In The Manor Restaurant. Staff Were Very Courteous.,,,,,
,546,All The Food Was Amazing And The Service Was Very Attentive And Professional. We Expected To Get Ripped Off On Wine Prices But In Fact The Prices Were Reasonable.,,,,,
,547,Anna Was Exceptional But She Always Is.  Anna Is A Great Asset To Your Organisation.,,,,,
,552,The Staff In Le Blaireau Were Much More Friendly Than Those In The Zen Garden. ,,,,,
,555,Service Was Good In The Zen Garden However  In The Manor Restaurant  The "Fine Dining Restaurant" The Waiter Reached Across Me To Remove My Wife's Plate Rather Than Walking Round.,,,,,
,558,Starter - Fantastic
Main - Fantastic
Desert - Ok (Maybe The Pastries Chief Was Off)
Wine Choice - Fantastic,,,,,
,560,Waiter Was Brilliant,,,,,
,561,Zen And Blaireaus Were Exceptionally Good,,,,,
,564,As Before  Just Let Down By The Ambience Of The Manor Restaurant Itself. And The Poor Music/Music System!,,,,,
,566,The Food Was Poor  We Were Expecting A Very High Standard Considering The Price  The Restaurant Itself Was Very Nice!,,,,,
,567,Wasn't Keen On The Seating At The Tables  I Felt The Opposite Table As Though We Often Would Be Looking At Each Other's Tables,,,,,
,568,No.,,,,,
,573,No Other Comments To Make.,,,,,
,574,Question 13 Answers Was To The Zen Garden. The Food At Le Blairleau Wasn't Very Nice And The Restaurant Wasn't Very Clean. ,,,,,
,578,No,,,,,
,581,No. It Was A Perfect Night!,,,,,
,583,Please Previous Comment Which Was Our Main Criticism. Unfortunately The Starters That Were Brought Out To Us Were Incorrect And For Another Table. The Starter Was Fairly Average But The Steak Main Course Did Make Up For This. ,,,,,
,587,Le Blaireau - Maybe Try And Accommodate Guests Rather Than Simply Turn Them Away. We Felt That We Were A Hinder Acne To Have Even Asked To Eat There As We Hadn't Booked  Although The Young Girl Was Very Friendly.,,,,,
,591,We Wanted To Use The Zen Garden But Not Open On Monday's - The Manor Was An Excellent 2Nd Choice,,,,,
,592,The Thai Restaurant Was Exquisite.  Best Thai Food I've Had In A Long Time And We Do Have A Very Good Thai Restaurant Where We Live.  The Blaireau Was Ok.  My Husband Enjoyed His Food But My Starter Was Average And My Steak Was Hard.  We Did Not Try The Manor Restaurant But Will Definitely Book A Table There Next Time We Visit.,,,,,
,595,Head Waiter At Le Blaireau Was Amusing!,,,,,
,596,We Experienced A Problem At Le Blaireau Which Was Handled Very Professionally,,,,,
,597,Previously The Breakfast Was Table Service Which Again This Time Made It Felt Like Standards Has Slipped With A Buffet,,,,,
,599,Got Lost Couple Of Times In Endless Corridors .. Perhaps Better Signage?
Why Do You Have A Room Of Tables In The Manor Restaurant With The Chair Backs To The Windows?? A Beautiful View Yet I Was Sat With My Back To That Green Pretty View Staring Out At Other Diners Who Could Look Past Me Out Of The Windows!!!
,,,,,
,602,Training By Chef To Waiting Staff On The Menu So They Understand The Questions Being Asked About The Food Etc  Nothing Says Professional/Class Like A Well Informed Waiter,,,,,
,606,We  Live In London And Benefit From Plenty Of High Quality Restaurants Which  Due To The Level Of Competition  Offer Better Quality At A Lower Price Point. So  Maybe Our Comments May Appear A Little Harsh In That Light.  In Essence  We Spent Over £100 For Dinner For Two Which Was So-So And Represented Poor Value For Money. The Service Was Friendly And Warm Which Was Appreciated.  However  It Was Also Slow.  It Appeared That There Was Insufficient Staff. Overall  Reasonably Pleasant But The Lunchtime Menu Is Probably A Better Offering At The Right Price Point.,,,,,
,607,Quite Expensive,,,,,
,611,We Decided The Zen Would Have More Atmospere ,,,,,
,613,Have To Say The Whole Thai Experience Was Simply Outstanding,,,,,
,618,Delicious And Perfectly Balanced Flavours.,,,,,
,619,Breakfast And Lunch Were Fantastic! The Thai Restaurant Had Great Service But The Food Was A Little Disappointing ,,,,,
,620,Steak In Le Blaireau Was Poor,,,,,
,624,The Manor Restaurant Was Very Impersonal - Far To Bigger Area - Tables Should Be Closer To Each Other.  However The Food Was Excellent.,,,,,
,626,£5 For A Small Bottle Of Chang Is Too Expensive. ,,,,,
,627,None.,,,,,
,628,Plates Cleared Away Whilst Other Diner Still Eating,,,,,
,636,The Menu Was Limited Which Is Fine.  We Had Steak - Not Worth The £22.50.  My Guests' Steak Was Cold On A Cold Plate And Therefore Returned.  It Was Just Cooked A Bit More Which Meant That It Was Overdone And No Longer Medium-Rare.  Sent Back Again And Then Replaced With A New One  By Which Time I Had Finished Mine.  I Asked For A Reduction (Was Not Offered One) And Was Given The Dessert And Coffee At Zero Charge.  Very Disappointing.  Some Years Ago When I Visited  There Was A Fixed Price 2/3 Course Menu And I Recall The Food Was Delicious In Those Days.  I Wish We Had Tried The Zen Garden One Instead.,,,,,
,637,It Was All Amazing Food.,,,,,
,639,None,,,,,
,640,Friendly Staff  Fantastic Food!!,,,,,
,641,Superb Food  We Are Beef Farmers And The Steak We Had In Le Blairuex Was As Good As The Steak We Are Used To At Home  Cooked Perfectly To Our Request So Again Well Done. My Husband Had Chocolate Mousse Which I Often Make He Said Mine Matched Yours For Taste But Your Texture Was Better So I Will Have To Practice!!,,,,,
,646,I Prefer The Meal In Zen Garden.Not A Large Selection Of Sweets At Le Blaireau,,,,,
,650,Excellent Meal. Staff Were Very Friendly And Attentive. The Friday Night Deal With £40 Per Person Credit Is Very Good Value. ,,,,,
,651,Breakfast In The Zen Garden Was Outstanding  Very Relaxing And The Staff Were Expectionally Welcoming.,,,,,
,652,Service Was Very Quick We Didn't Get A Chance To Rest Between Courses Which Was A Bit Disappointing.,,,,,
,654,The Food Was Very Nice And The Breakfast Was Excellent,,,,,
,656,Waited 50 Mins For Starters  Others Who Arrived After Us Got Served Before. Nice Selection Of Locally Sourced Food Though.,,,,,
,660,Food Was Not Up To Standard And Steak And Lamb Very Chewy,,,,,
,661,I Booked Online For Dinner Both Nights Which Was Very Easy. Service In Le Blaireau Was Excellent And The Food Good  A Shame The Chocolate Dessert I Used To Have Is No Longer On The Menu. Food In Zen Garden Was Really Good  The Restaurant Was Busy And Service Very Quick But We Asked The Waitress To Hold Our Mains For A Short While Which She Did No Problem. The Best Thai Food I've Had Anywhere. ,,,,,
,665,Ice Cream Portion Size Was Tiny For £8.50,,,,,
,667,The Food And Service In The Manor Restaurant Was Fantastic  The Pianist Was A Lovely Touch. The Ambience Did Feel A Little Awkward Though  Not Really Elegant & Cosy As I Had Expected. ,,,,,
,668,Food Was Of The Highest Quality. We Did Send Back My Wife's Lamb  And I Did Think The Lamb Was A Little Under Cooked. We Were Warned That It Would Be Served "Pink". Pink Generally Means Medium. It Was Rare/Blue Towards The Bottom. If The Dish Was Served To Me  I Would Have Not Sent It Back  However My Wife Prefers A Medium. Overall  Excellent Meal And Service Was Superb.,,,,,
,669,Due To A Very Busy Restaurant  There Was A Delay In Receiving Attention  But Overall  We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Experience There And Would Recommend It - Food Was Delicious!,,,,,
,670,I Just Wondered Whether Some Foliage Type Divides (Or Similar) Would Make For A More Intimate Or Cosy Feel To The Restaurant. ,,,,,
,673,Fantastic Meals! Le Blaireau Had A Lovely Atmosphere With Friendly Staff And Beautiful Food. Zen Garden Had Highly Efficient Service And Again The Choice And Quality Of Food Was Fantastic. We Would Definitely Eat At Le Blaireau  In Particular  Again.,,,,,
,675,The Beef Was Perfection,,,,,
,678,I Had Breakfast In The Manor Restaurant And It Was Not Good At All. A Buffet Breakfast Is Not Appropriate For An Hotel Of Your Standard. ,,,,,
,679,Lovely Food And Service. The Restaurant Could Perhaps Have A Little More Atmosphere. ,,,,,
,683,The Lamb In The Manor Restaurant On The Sunday Evening Could Have Been Better  But The Overall Experiance Was Very Good,,,,,
,686,Every Part Of Both Meals And Each Breakfast Was Amazing In Taste  Variety And Presentation. All Staff Were Friendly And Very Attentive. Anna  The Waitress From The Manor  Was Particularly Attentive And Charming. The Main Waiter In The Zen Garden Was Particularly Attentive And Accommodating.,,,,,
,688,Meal Was Nice,,,,,
,690,We Had An All Round Amazing Wknd At Carys Manor And Senspa And Quality Of Food Was Exceptional  Unfortunately We Didn't Have A Great Experience When We Dined At The Zen Garden On Sunday The 18Th May  Although The Food Was Delicious We Found The Waiter Who Served Us ( Who I Think Was The Manager) Very Abrupt And Really Quite Rude To Us  We Felt Very Uncomfortable And It Ruined The Experience For Us  Especially When I Specifically Asked Home How Best To Pay For Our Meal He Said We Could Charge To The Room So I Gave Him Our Room Number  Name And Signature And We Went In Out Way Assuming All Was Ok  The At 4Pm When Me And My Friend Made Our Way To Spa Reception For Our Treatments He Suddenly Appeared And Got Very Confrontational With Us About Not Paying For Our Lunch? We Were Very Confused And Embarrassed  The Lady On Spa Reception Was Wonderful And Very Polite And Explained We Needed To Out My Card Details Into The System So I Went Back To My Room And Got My Card Meanwhile The Zen Manager Would Not Leave My Friends Side  Even When I Returned Offering To Pay In Cash For The Food He Still Seemed Very Rude And Wouldn't Leave Us Alone Until The Spa Receptionist Assured Him It Was Ok  This Left Us Feeling Upset And Embarrassed And We Avoided The Zen Restuarant For The Remainder If Our Wknd Which Was A Real Shame As The Food Was Excellent ,,,,,
,692,Food Was Excellent But All Diners Were Crammed Into The Same Area  Say Up To A Dozen Tables  In One Corner. Why Can't We Be Given A Bit More Space When The Restaurant Is Way Below Capacity.,,,,,
,702,Firstly The Waiter Forgot The Drinks  He Then Forgot To Advise Us They Had Run Out If The Vegetables. He Just Put The Wine On The Table And We Had To Ask For It To Be Opened. The Food Was Very Good But The Experience Was Very Much Let Down By The Unprofessional Service. ,,,,,
,703,More Of A Choice On Menu,,,,,
,709,Tried To Serve Warm White Wine As Being Correct?,,,,,
,712,Never Had A Better Gluten Free Service!,,,,,
,716,When We Arrived We Were Told About The Restaurants But It Wasn't Mentioned They Were Full  So When We Came Down For Dinner To Find The French Restaurant Fully Booked And Advised We Should Have Booked  This Was Something I Felt Would Have Been Useful To Know When We Arrived. We Ate The Manor Restaurant Twice  The First Evening Was Excellent Although The Service Varied Between Exceptional To Blundering. We Also Booked To Eat At The French Restaurant  But After Sitting At Our Table For 20 Mins With Nothing But A Glas Of Water  Our Waiter Informed Us That The Lamb We Wanted Would Take Another 30 Mins To Cook  At Which Point We Left To Find Somewhere Else. The Waiter And Manager Were Exceptionally Professional However  And We Were Told A Large Booking Had Arrived Earlier Than Expected. ,,,,,
,720,Most Of The Tables And Chairs We Sat At In The Manor Restaurant Were Wobbly And Falling Apart And Despite Informing A Waiter About Them They Were Still Being Used The Next Day
We Ate In The Manor For 2 Nights And 1 In The Le Blaireau And We Had A Better Meal In The Le Blaireau With Better Service
Overall The Service/Food Was Disappointing For The Price Paid.,,,,,
,723,Manor Restaurant Was Nice Food And Fairly Polite Staff But Zen Thai Was Amazing All Round Staff Decor Food And Treatment All Amazing  At Zen Garden  Breakfast Not Included And For 436 A Night I Found This Dear To Pay For Seperatl Should Of Been Able To Pay A Smaller Cost For Even Toast Or Croissant ,,,,,
,724,Superb,,,,,
,725,The Manor Restaurant Has A Dress Code  As Stated On Your Website [No Demins]  But This Is Not Adhered To.,,,,,
,732,The Wine Is On The Whole Rather Expensive,,,,,
,733,Manor Restaurant Needs Redecorating.  Not Keen On The Angled Chairs In The Mr As It Put Us Very Close To Those Dining Next To Us,,,,,
,739,Wonderful Meal In The Manor Restaurant ,,,,,
,744,None. ,,,,,
,747,The Zen Garden Restaurant Was A Really Fantastic Meal.,,,,,
,748,Afternoon Tea Was Exceptional,,,,,
,749,Food And Service Very Good  Particularly The Blaireau

Hot Breakfast Disappointing As Self-Service And Bacon And Eggs Not Nice When Kept Warm,,,,,
,752,Slightly Disappointed That Dining Options Were Limited On The Monday Night To French Or Very Formal As Zen Garden Was Shut. We Didn't Want French Or Formality (My Friend Only Had Jeans With Her). So We Had To Go Somewhere Else. ,,,,,
,755,I Did Not Feel The Buffet Style Breakfast Was In Keeping With The Overall Standard Of The Hotel.,,,,,
,757,The Music At Breakfast Was Annoying  Inappropriate For Breakfast Time And Naff. I Tried To Explain This To The Breakfast Manager But His English Was Not Good Enough To Understand What I Meant.
The Music And His Lack Of Understanding Was A Big Drawback.,,,,,
,759,The Manor Restaurant Vegetarian Option Could Have Been A Bit More Exciting - It Was Nice Though,,,,,
,760,Service Slow And The Restaurant Was Very Very Warm.  We Had To Ask For A Window To Be Opened.

I Am Never Really Bothered By This But In Was Genuinely Stuffy.,,,,,
,762,Food Although Tasty And Ample Was Quite Bland And A Little Uninteresting.  Choice Of Meals Not Exceptional. Not As Fine A Dining Experience As Was Expecting.  ,,,,,
,763,Fantastic Food And Wonderful Service From Justyna (Again!),,,,,
,765,Food And Service Is Always Excellent  Especially In The Manor Restaurant,,,,,
,767,I Am A Complete Pain To Accommodate In Any Restaurant  In Fact I Usually Avoid Eating Out!  However At Carey's Manor I Know That I Will Be Well Looked After  Just The Short List Of Things I Am Unable To Eat Include Dairy  Gluten  Tomato  Potato  Pepper  Onion  Garlic  .... Each Meal I Had During My Two Night  3 Day Stay  Was Beautifully Prepared  Cooked  Served And More Importantly Delicious  Thank You Everyone.
,,,,,
,769,The Dining Was Ok But Almost Too Quite With Not Much Flexibility With Ordering Food. No Ambience In The Afternoon And Anything We Asked Seemed Too Much Trouble Leaving My Mother Feeling As Though She Was Being Troublesome. We Therefore Went Out To The Local Pub To Eat As Felt More Comfortable With That Option.,,,,,
,770,The Food In The Bistros Was Very Good But The Service Was Slow Even Though The Restaurant Was Not Busy.,,,,,
,773,The Complimentary Glasses Of Champaign In The Zen Garden For Our Lunch Was A Great Touch And A Nice Surprise For My Girlfriends Birthday Made Us Feel Very Welcome.,,,,,
,775,I Would Have Liked To See More Shell Fish On The Menus.,,,,,
,777,We Were Sat Around The Corner From The Main Dining Area And Kept Having To Get Up To Get The Serving Staff's Attention. When They Eventually Came To Serve Us  They Were Very Friendly And Polite,,,,,
,778,This Is The 4Th Time I Have Dined In The Zen Garden And The Food Is Lovely  Staff Are So Friendly And Professional.,,,,,
,779,Stunning Food! The Music Was A Little Too Close To The Table But It Was Moved A Little Further Away On Request.,,,,,
,782,Yummy With An Excellent Choice Of Wines - ,,,,,
,783,Very Good,,,,,
,786,Very High Quality Dining And Excellent Service.,,,,,
,788,Unfortunately We Found The Chairs In Le Blaireau And The Zen Restaurants Were Hard And Uncomfortable. 
The Chairs In The Manor Restaurant However Were Very Comfortable. ,,,,,
,793,Different Experience To The One Evening At Le Blaireau  See Back,,,,,
,794,The Manor Was Excellent For Food And Service But This Was Not The Case At Le Blaireau A Dissappointment,,,,,
,796,On Sunday !St June My Wife And I Booked Our Second Evening Meal  Everything Was Fine Until Daniel Served Me My Char Grilled Steak  Which Was Tough And More Than 25% Fat And Gristle  I Did Mention This To Daniel  But It Must Have Fallen On Deaf Ears.,,,,,
,799,Le Blaireau Was Lovely  Service Started Out Very Slow But They Waiter Apologised Numerous Times So We Didn't Mind At All. Food Was Lovely. The Thai Restaurant Let Us Down As We Felt It Was Very Overpriced And There Was Only A Buffet On Offer.. Which Was £22 Each For Lunch. A Lot Of Money When We Just Wanted A Light Lunch. We Were Eventually Offered A Sandwich Menu Which Was Reasonably Priced. ,,,,,
,802,Sorry  Please See My Previous Comments.,,,,,
,803,On The Second Night We Decided To Order A Chargrilled Steak.  Unfortunately One Of These Was Not A Very Good Cut And Was Mostly Uneaten.  When Mentioned To Our Waiter (Daniel) It Was Not Possible To Offer An Alternative.,,,,,
,808,It Was Great! The Cafe Gourmand Is A Bit Odd  Though!,,,,,
,817,Good Choice Of Food Well Cooked And Presented. My Husband Asked About A Dietary Matter And The Response Was Good. ,,,,,
,818,As Stated Previously,,,,,
,822,We Ate In The Blaireau. Food Was Bland And Disappointing And Ambiance And Decor Were Dated And Jaded.  The Entrance To The Restaurant From The Hotel Was A Bit Grim And It Didn't Smell Fresh.  The Staff Were Friendly  But The Head Waiter Had Strong Body Odour  Which Was Off Putting.  I Asked For Information On One Of The Fish Dishes And The Waiter Said He Had No Idea What It Was  But Apparently It Was His First Day So We Put This Down To Poor Training.  This Experience Was Really The Only Disappointment And Let Down Of The Stay.  We Had Intended To Eat There Both Nights Of Our Stay  But Ate Out The Second Night.,,,,,
,823,Only Applied To The Thai Restaurant.

Tried To Order A Cocktail From The Manor Rest. Bar Only To Find The Ingredients Weren't Available And The Bar Tender Didn't Know How To Make It Anyway  -  Requested A Brandy Alexander.....,,,,,
,826,Le Blaireau Had A Good Selection Of Food And We Really Enjoyed Each Course.  
The Zen Garden Was Very Popular And We Could See Why  We Had A Lovely Meal There.
We Would Eat At Both Places Again.,,,,,
,828,Le Blaireau - Service Excellant (Thank You James) Food Very Disappointing Decor Disappointing 
The Manor - Service Excellant  Food Great.  Would Of Loved The Piano Man To Have Stay Longer.  Our Table Was At 8.30 At He Only Played For A Short While And Once Gone There Was Little Atmosphere.
The Zen Garden - Breakfast 1St Day Very Disorganised But After That Lunch And Breakfast Thereafter Excellant.,,,,,
,830,Perfectly Satisfactory,,,,,
,835,Excellent Selection Of Vegetarian Foods,,,,,
,836,As A Recovering Throat Cancer Patient Specifically Requested Spaghetti Bolognese To Be Available Every Day. Unfortunately The Kitchen Did Not Have Any Quality Ingredients And Their Efforts Resulted In Something Like A Cow Pat.Ironically This Experience Was So Disappointing That I Decided To Try Some Fish.With Huge Amounts Of Extra Sauce And Much Patience It Worked.Overall Blaireaus Were Brilliant Zen And Manor Average.
,,,,,
,841,Very Good Food  Friendly Staff,,,,,
,842,Keep The Standard At This Level And I Can't Foresee Any Problems.,,,,,
,845,These Were The Two Issues I Had. One With Le Blaireau And One With Zen. Please Speak With The Spa Manager To Discuss. Zen Food Was Amazing. Food In Le Blaireau Was Nice And Same With Manor Restaurant. Staff In The Manor Were Brilliant.,,,,,
,846,As Stated Previously The Wine List In The Manor Restaurant Was Very Over Priced,,,,,
,847,Can't Add To The Above  Everything Was Excellent.,,,,,
,848,Food Was First Class. Surprised We Couldn't Get A Booking For 8Pm Though As The Restaurant Wasn't Full.,,,,,
,853,The Staff Are Always Very Friendly And Extremely Helpful,,,,,
,856,Some Of The Best Food I've Eaten Anywhere.,,,,,
,857,The Restaurant Was More Like A Conference Room Than A Fine Dining   And The Table Were Wobbly ,,,,,
,859,We Only Dined In The Manor Restaurant At Breakfast So Cannot Comment On The Evening Service.  The Breakfast Was Ok  The Staff Were Helpful Especially The Head Waiter.  I Would Not Say That Breakfast Was Exceptional.  We Have Dined In The Restaurant On Previous Visits But The Food Is Not To My Mothers Taste.,,,,,
,861,Le Blaireau Had Suffered A Fault In The  Water System And We Were Served Salty Coffee. The Manager Apologised And Offered A Cafitiere. Excellent Evening Meal In The Sen Restaurant. Negatives - No Buffet Breakfast In Sen Restaurant (Due To Low Volume Of Guests). Served Instant Coffee In A Cavitiere. The Cooked Breakfast Tasted Like It Had Been Reheated. During Breakfast We Had To Endure An Electrical Contractor Undertaking A Service Of The Light Bulbs. ,,,,,
,862,Blaireaus Excellent.Zen Average.Manor Average. ,,,,,
,863,Manor Restaurant Decor Tired,,,,,
,864,The Only Negative Was The Piped Music Which Wasn't Quite What I Expected Given The Surroundings. For Some Reason (Maybe The Music Choice !) This Felt More Obtrusive At Beakfast The Following Morning.,,,,,
,866,The Manor Restaurant Was Our Favourite And The Service Much Better Than Le Blaireau.  We Would Recommend The Use Of Toothpicks To Be Displayed On Tables.  We Enjoyed Both Experiences.,,,,,
,868,It Was My Husband's Birthday And They Brought Us A Glass Of Prosecco To Celebrate. Nice Touch.,,,,,
,872,We Ate In The Bar And Room Service Also.  

Zen Garden Lunch And Le Blaireau Food Was Excellent.  A Finger Bowl Or Wipe With Shell On Prawns Would Have Been Good.

The Bar Food A Little Disappointing.  Room Service Breakfast Was Ok And The Missing Cooked Food Remedied Promptly.,,,,,
,874,All The Food Was Excellent,,,,,
,876,Please See Comment About Afternoon Tea Previously Made,,,,,
,877,The Staff Were Very Polite And Attentive. The Dishes Were Very Tasty. Dining Was Exceptionally Good.,,,,,
,879,The Service In The Zen Was A Little Disappointing,,,,,
,880,The Restaurant Lacked A Little In Atmosphere  Although The Staff Who Looked After Us Were Very Attentive.

It Would Helpful To Identify The Products On Yuor Cheese Menu That Are 'Vegetarian Friendly'  Given You Have A Separate Vegetarian Menu.,,,,,
,886,Lovely Attentive Staff  Food Was Great. Menu At The Front Was Not What Was Offered Once In The Restaurant. We Were Advise That They Literally Change The Menu And Hadnt Had Time To Update. It's A Very Minor Point But It's Not Hard To Change The Menu At The Front In A Timely Manner To Avoid Disappointment. ,,,,,
,887,We Had A Late Table Reservation. It Was For Our Wedding Anniversary And When We Arrived At The Restaurant They Had Run Out Of Some Of The Starters And Main Courses Which Was A Shame As I Struggled To Find A Starter Or Main Course I Wanted On The Menu As The Things I Would Have Ordered Were Not Available. Food Was Good But As I Had To Chose Something I Wouldn't Normally Order I Didn't Enjoy It As Much.,,,,,
,889,Just Relaxing And Lovely!,,,,,
,890,The Waiting Staff In Le Blaireau Were Excellent. The Two Young Men Who Served Us On Monday Evening Were Particularly Good. We Had Very Well Mixed Cocktails To Start And Then Moved Into The Dining Room To Eat. I Thought The Restaurant Design Was Excellent - Very Authentic And Not Tacky At All  Which A Lot Of 'Themed' Restaurants Can Be!,,,,,
,891,The Best Breakfast With Vast Choices.  Zen Garden Is Sublime.  Manor Restaurant Is Very Good.  ,,,,,
,892,We Look Forward To Trying Your Other Restaurants On Future Visits. From Our Experience We Have Every Confidence They Will Meet The High Standards We Experienced On Our Stay.,,,,,
,895,As Above,,,,,
,898,No,,,,,
,901,Very Good And Would Recommend The Restaurant To Friends.,,,,,
,903,By Far The Best Part Of Our Stay  10/10,,,,,
,907,The Food Was Not Really Well Seasoned. Overall Very Disappointing. I Had Lunch In The Zen Garden Which Was Extremely Nice. ,,,,,
,908,Want To Do It All Again,,,,,
,910,Le Blaireau - Please Sort Out The Music Which Was Not Pleasant To Listen To.  Much Nicer Atmosphere/Surroundings In The Zen Garden.  Both Restaurants Pricey.,,,,,
,913,All 3 Restaurants Were Very Good,,,,,
,918,This Was Faultless,,,,,
,921,I Have Eaten Here Before Which Is Why We Returned But I Found The Service To Be Extremely Slow. Although Our Main Courses Were Very Nice The Starters Were Very Middle Of The Road.,,,,,
,923,I Wasn't Very Impressed With The Quality Of The Meal. I Have The Lamb Which Cost £21 And For That Type Of Money I Expected It To Be Of High Quality. But The Meat Was Very Chewy And It Was All Just Very Average. There Were No Real Flavours Or Anything Special. Even The Starter And Pudding Was Very Standard. I Was A Bit Disappointed To Be Honest. ,,,,,
,925,The Food And Service In The Zen Garden Were Exceptional.,,,,,
,927,The Manor Restaurant I Felt Was Lacking In Atmosphere  - Possibly Because It Was Not Busy. The Placement Of Tables And Chairs Meant That I Felt Stared At When Came In And Could Not Avoid Catching The Eyes Of Other Diners Placed Directly Opposite. This Made Me Feel Uncomfortable  Which Is Most Unusual For Me.  Wonderful Food  Friendly Service.  ,,,,,
,930,Not The Best Stay. Bottle Of Preseco Not In Room On First Night As Promised  I Had To Ask Three Different People At Different Times On The Second Day Until Someone Delivered Bottle To Room. I Expected This To Be Dealt With With Only One Request  Not Three.

 Breakfast On The First Morning. Ordered A Vegetarian Breakfast  Which Took Nearly 30Mins To Arrive  Had To Ask Three People Where It Was And Was Assured It Was On It Way. I Had Finished My Breakfast And Sat Waiting In An Emptying Breakfast Room As My Wife Became More Agitated At The Lack Of Her Breakfast And Service.

Despite Booking Over The Phone And 'Paying' For My First Night At The Time  I Was Shocked To See A Full Bill On Check-Out  Which Included The First Night. I Was Informed That This Sometimes Happens And That If I Went Away And Checked My Bank And I Had Been Charged Twice That I Could Call Up And Get A Refund.

Overall  What Was Supposed To Be A Luxurious And Relaxing Break Was Not What I Expected For The Price I Paid I Expected A Much Better Overall Experience.

I Have Had To Put My Wife Off Posting Her Review On Trip-Advisor Until I Have Given You The Chance To Reply To My Concerns.

,,,,,
,933,We Did Expect Somewhat More Choice Within The Manor Restaurant.,,,,,
,934,Dined In The Zen Garden For Dinner. Food Was Very Overpriced And Food Was Average At Best. Starters Came Out Steaming And Was Clear They Had Just Come Out Of A Microwave. Not Impressed For The Price. Cheaper In London And Better Quality.

We Went To Get A Drink At The Zen Garden At 5.30Pm And Decided To Have A Sandwich. The Waiter Was Extremely Unhelpful And Made Us Feel Very Uncomfortable As He Was Clearly Setting Up For The Dinner Service And Did Not Want Us There. When We Asked If We Could Order A Sandwich We Were Told That The Service Had Closed For The Even Though The Menu Stated Sandwiches Were Available Until 6Pm. We Argued This Point And Were Told The Hotel Had A Large Function And The Sandwich Could Take Some Time. We Finally Got The Sandwich After Much Debate.

As Paying Guests We Expect To Be Able To Order Food Up Until The Food Is Offered And Not Be Penalised Because The Hotel Has A Function On.,,,,,
,936,Our Waitress Was Amazing. Very Helpful And Professional ,,,,,
,937,Special Thanks To Elodia And Will For Looking After Us So Well. But All The Dining Staff Were Excellent. ,,,,,
,943,We Dined Mainly In Le  Blaireau  Where The Food And Ambience Was Excellent. The Staff Were Very Attentive And Courtious. Could Not Fault The Experience.
We Dined One Night Only In The Manor Restaurant Which Unfortuneatly Was A Disastor. The Food Was Aweful  The Potatos Were Over Cooked  The Chard Was Under Cooked. The Service Left A Lot To Be Desired  The Crumbs Were Not Removed Between Main And Desert Etc. Give Me Le Blaireau Every Time!,,,,,
,945,Dining In The Manor Was Unusually Disappointing. The Service Was Poor And The Food Not Of The Standard One Would Expect In A First Class Restaurant.,,,,,
,948,The Staff Were Very Pleasant  Helpful And Accommodating And Were Keen To Please. ,,,,,
,949,Loved The Manor Dining The Food Was Stunning And The Ambience Was Perfect. We Found The Food In The Zen Garden For Lunch Beautiful But As The Room Was Full It Was Very Noisy. This Also Applied To Breakfast It Was Very Busy And Very Noisy. Whereas The Morning We Breakfasted In The Manor Was A Lovely Calm Atmosphere.,,,,,
,950,Slow Service In The Zen
Very Hot In The Zen
Food Excellent In The Zen
Blaireau Was Odd/Decor Strange,,,,,
,951,Staff Exceptional. Brilliant Service! ,,,,,
,958,The Steak Was Not That Good Disappointing ,,,,,
,959,The Food In The Zen Garden Was Particularly Good.  I Had Dined There Before With My Son And It Was The Best Thai Meal That We Have Ever Eaten.  This Time It Was Just As Good.  The Food In Le Blaireau Restaurant Was Not As Good  But Still Very Acceptable.,,,,,
,960,Both Restaurants We Ate In Were Excellent. Will Try The Manor Restaurant Next Time. The Wine In Le Blaireau Was Excellent Also. ,,,,,
,963,Food Was Out Of This World. Quote "The Best Food  I Have Had" Girlfriend ,,,,,
,964,Your Staff Are Wonderful,,,,,
,965,Dining Is An Important Part Of Our Stay And We Certainly Enjoyed The Experience,,,,,
,968,Again Very Friendly Staff  And Good Food. ,,,,,
,969,My Dining Order Of A Sirloin Steak To Be Cooked And Served 'Medium' Was Over-Cooked And Completely Dry.,,,,,
,971,Room Service Waiter (Breakfast)  Was Exceptionally Professional And Polite.,,,,,
,972,Wheelchair Access Internally Is Difficult With The Stepdown At The Rear Entrance,,,,,
,973,Only Had Breakfast But All Above Relates.,,,,,
,974,I Felt The Manor Restaurant However Nice It Was Lacked Atmosphere As It Was Such A Large Room For Few People,,,,,
,978,Zen And Blaireau Very Good  Service And Food
Manor Restaurant Service Very Poor 50Min. From Ordering To Receiving Meal
Also My Steak Was Burnt On Theout Side {Did Complain To Head Waiter},,,,,
,979,Manor Restaurant Very Poor Service For Dinner But Good For Breakfast
50Min. From Ordering To Receiving Main Course And Steak Burnt On Out Side [Did Complain  To Head Waite,,,,,
,982,Pretty Good.  I Felt That Le Blaireau's Decor Was A Little Dated.  Loved The Zen Garden Although We Were Asked If We Would Like Dessert  After Our Dessert Plates Had Been Taken Away.  ,,,,,
,983,The Waiters Should Have Known Who Had Ordered What - Should Not Need To Ask The Customers,,,,,
,984,Service In The Zen Restaurant Was A Bit Slow  But We Weren't In A Rush So It Didn't Matter. They Did Apologise On Wednesday Evening As There Were Only 2 Serving And Doing The Best They Could.,,,,,
,985,Hire More People Like Samczec!,,,,,
,987,Very Nice Staff  Decent Food At A Reasonable Price ,,,,,
,988,The Zen Garden Was Excellent With Good Food And Service. The Manor Restaurant Was Average We Found The Cod Dish Bland  No Ice In Water On Hot Night. Small Choice Of Deserts And One Not Available. The Room Itself Was In Poor Condition In Need Of New Carpet. Breakfast Was Poor  Fresh Fruit Very Limited And Continental Almost Non Existent.,,,,,
,989,Joel Was Incredibly Patient With Us As We Had Bought Another Guest Unexpectedly And Raised Our Sense Of Direction Was Shocking And Kept An Eye On Us Making Sure We Didn't Get Lost En Route To The Ladies Or Reception. The Food Was Amazing  So Tasty And The Wine Delicious.,,,,,
,993,Ran Out Of The Moules Mariniere . 
Main Courses Lacking In Imagination,,,,,
,994,As Mentioned Previously  We Were Surprised That The Menu (Especially The Specials Board) Did Not Change.,,,,,
,995,Food Was Mediocre. At Best!,,,,,
,997,The First Night We Dined In The Manor Restaurant  Which Was Very Nice  Except We Ordered A Good Bottle Of Pouilly Fume To Go With Our Meal. When It Was Tried When It Arrived It Was Commented It Was Warm. They Agreed And Put Some More Ice In The Ice Bucket. However It Was Not Ready To Drink Until Half Way Through The Main Course  And We Had To Have Water With The Starter And Most Of Main Course  Which Defeated The Object Of Purchasing It. We Were Booked Into The Manor Restaurant On Our Second Night  But Due To This Changed The Booking To Le Blaireau Restaurant  Where We Had An Exceptional Meal With Very Good Service.,,,,,
,1000,Fantastic Meal Once Again. Great Selection. ,,,,,
,1001,The Food  Service And General Dining Experience In The Manor And Bar Before Was Excellent. We Were Served By Anna Who Was Particularly Good.,,,,,
,1004,Amazing Food & Lovely Staff,,,,,
,1008,Le Blaireau Was Excellent Both The Food And The Friendly And Efficient Service. In The Manor Restaurant  Food Was Again Excellent And Staff Were Polite And Keen  But Please Ask Them Not To Check Everything Is Ok At One Table  With The Dirty Plates From Another Table In Their Hands!,,,,,
,1010,1St Class Food And Beverages,,,,,
,1011,The Food Was Great And We Felt Value For Money.,,,,,
,1014,Missed The Selection Rolls And Breads In The Manor Restaurant For Dinner And At Breakfast.Although We Like Both Restaurants  We Do Like Le Blaireau  We Had Lunch And Dinner There Over The Three Days..,,,,,
,1017,Jose Was Very Welcoming Before Dinner And Anna Was A Real Gem,,,,,
,1020,Overall  A Good Experience. Being Picky  The Only Thing I Noticed Was That The Windows  Both Inside And Out  Needed A Good Clean.,,,,,
,1024,See Previous Comments Please .,,,,,
,1028,The Food In The Le Blaireau Was Very Good .As Was The Manor Resturant Apart For The Steak When Asked If Every Thing Was Ok At The Time It Was But By The Time I Had Eaten Through The Steak The Other End Was Over Cooked .I Did Explain To The Staff And Was Aware That The Steak Had Got Thinner At The Later End But The Waitress Didn't Really Seem To Worried And Said It Happens Which Was A Shame.
Breakfast Was Very Good And Plenty As Was The Zen Garden,,,,,
,1029,Food Excellent In The Manor. Le Blarieau Food Was Good For What It Was  But Could Be Excellent And Again Not Quite Up To The Prices (But Could Be).,,,,,
,1030,Enjoyed The Piano Player ,,,,,
,1031,We Booked The Meal After Reading About Your Locally Sourced And Organic Ingredients In The Guide In Our Room. The Intimate  Candle Lit Ambience Was Perfect After A Long Day.,,,,,
,1032,Restaurant Staff Were Efficient And Friendly.,,,,,
,1033,Best Bacon I've Had In Ages  And Marmite On Offer Is Always Welcome!,,,,,
,1034,Lack's Atmosphere,,,,,
,1039,While Dining In The Manor Restaurant We Ordered A Bottle Of Prosseco. At No Point After The Bottle Had Initially Been Opened Did The Waitress Top Up Our Glasses. Eventually After We'd Finished Our Meal And Were Fed Up Of Waiting I Got Up From The Table To Get The Bottle From The Bucket To Do It Myself. My Partner And I Were Unimpressed  Especially Considering The Reputation Of Your Restaurant. ,,,,,
,1042,The Piano Was A Excellent Addition To The Restaurant. The Pianist Was Exceptionally Good. (I Do Play Myself So Do Know When Someone Is Very Very Good!)
The Food Was Just The Right Portion Size But So Tasty.,,,,,
,1043,Great Vegetarian Menu In The Zen Garden.  Le Blaireau Had Very Limited Vegetarian Options But I Suppose You Would Expect That For A French Restaurant.  That Being Said Having A Few More Vegetarian Options Would Have Meant We Would Have Dined There Rather Than Walking Into Brockenhurst To Another Restaurant/Pub.,,,,,
,1045,A Very Good Selection At Breakfast. ,,,,,
,1047,Service A Bit Hit And Miss Not The Most Welcoming Of Waitresses Initially Could Put More Thought In To Seating Loads Of Empty  Tables But Put Right Next To Another Couple. Was Told Could Not Eat Til 9Pm But Not Busy When We Arrived At 845,,,,,
,1049,The Food In All Three Of The Restaurants Was Top Class Very Well Presented   Very Good Quality ,,,,,
,1050,Steak Was Awful. Manager Even Agreed. Other Food Was Good.,,,,,
,1051,Room Service Has Always Been Good But A Bit Hit And Miss This Time But Always Put Right,,,,,
,1053,Loved The Menu Options And The Swan Fashioned From A Swede Was Impressive!,,,,,
,1055,See Earlier Comments  The Zen Garden Was Excellent  But Please Improve The Wine List. The Manor Restaurant Was A Disaster  Particularly Given How Few People Were Present On A Saturday Night,,,,,
,1057,Very Professional Waiting Staff. Food In Manor Was Very Expensive.,,,,,
,1062,Table Booked At 8Pm- Order Taken 8.20 Starter Arrived Over Half An Hour Later- Long Delays On Nearby Tables Re Clearing Plates- Advised By Manager At 9.10 Meal Would Be 3 Minutes Took Over 8 Minutes To Arrive- Food Mediocre And Appeared To Have Been Sat On Hot Plate-1 Meal Swimming In Olive Oil- No Asking If Food Ok- Really Bad Experience Left Without Dessert As Service So Slow And Bad- Complained At Hotel Reception,,,,,
,1068,Le Blaireau Was Very Disappointing For Dinner - Food Was Not Up Standard & Service Was Slow - The Cost Did Not Match The Quality Of Food
Zen Garden - Nice But Duck In Curry Very Sinewy
The Manor Was Good,,,,,
,1073,Service Was Slow At Times,,,,,
,1074,Meat Portions Were Quite Small But Very Very Tasty. ,,,,,
,1075,Missed The Amuse Bouche At The Manor This Time!,,,,,
,1076,Would Not Change The Lighting But It Was Difficult To Read The Menu.,,,,,
,1078,Food Good  Apart From Breakfast  Which Just Rubbish Really. The Service Was Poor  Willing Staff But No Training.  The Ambience In The Manor Restaurant Was Missing.,,,,,
,1081,We Enjoyed Both Restaurants - Le Blaireau On Friday Night  The Zen Garden On Saturday Night.  The Food Was Of A Very High Standard  As Was The Service.  The Zen Garden Is A Particular Favourite Of Ours And The Thai Food Is The Best We've Had Anywhere.  ,,,,,
,1082,Food Was Amazing  Staff Friendly And Service Perfect,,,,,
,1083,It Was Not Very Clear How The £40 Off Our Evening Meals Worked.  When We Asked At Reception We Were Told That The Bill Should Be Discounted By £40/Each When Receive The Bill After Our Meals.  However After Our Meal The Restaurant Staff Said That The Bill Will Be Discounted When We Checkout.  I Think The Process Should Be Clarified As Part Of The Booking Process.,,,,,
,1088,Very Accommodating About The Need For A Dairy Free Diet In All The Restaurants .,,,,,
,1089,We Had Lunch From The Manor Resturant  Ordered From The Bar  Just A Sandwich And Chips  The Sandwich Came Out With No Ham And Was Very Late Due To A Conference Party Arriving And Ordering Drinks. Waiter Took It Away Then Brought It Back The Plate Have 1 Less Chip On It. Quiye Disapointing As You Only Get 6. Although The 5 We Had Were Very Tasty. I Wold Put This Error Down To The Bar Tender Being Flustered And Incapable Of Taking Correct Food Orders. May Have Been A Language Barrier.,,,,,
,1092,See Earlier Comments About 80Th Birthday Tea.,,,,,
,1095,We Could Not Fault The Thai Restaurant.  However  We Found The Bistro To Be Disappointing In Terms Of Menu Choice   Preperation And Service. We Sat Outside As It Was So Hot That Evening. We Felt That The Staff Objected Yo Us Asking For A Table For 4 Split For 2. The Table Wobbled And We Had To Ask For It To Be Moved And Stabilised. We Wouldn't Eat In There Again. Although We Will Come Back Again To The Hotel.,,,,,
,1098,N/A,,,,,
,1099,We Also Dined At The Manor Restaurant Which We Found Disappointing.,,,,,
,1100,The Food In The Restaurant On The Night We Ate There Was Generally Good - Although Both My Wife And I Had The Cheesecake Dessert And Were Disappointed. For £8.50 It Just Wasn't Special Enough.  On Both Mornings We Had Breakfast And Were Pleased With The Hot Items Which We Ordered From The Menu.,,,,,
,1104,Fantastic Food,,,,,
,1106,We Would Have Liked To Have Dined In Zen Garden But The Day We Stayed It Was Shut,,,,,
,1107,Other Than Potentially Getting The Recipe For The Spinach & Ricotta Malfatti... No,,,,,
,1108,It Was Nice  But Not As Special As It Has Been In The Past.,,,,,
,1115,Have Used The Zen Garden Previously And It Was Excellent As Always. This Was The First Time We Tried Le Blaireau And Found The Food Wonderful. Both Restaurants  Were Very Helpful With Regard To Our Request For Gluten Free Options.,,,,,
,1116,Nice Food And Good For The Children,,,,,
,1117,Food Was Very Good.,,,,,
,1118,The Room Service Menu Was Overpriced For What It Was  As Was The Food At The Zen Restaurant. I Have Had Similar Food At Thai Restaurants For A Lot Less. Also  When We Ordered A Side Order Of Chips  We Were Expecting A Few More Than 6!,,,,,
,1120,Overall Great Dinner. Had To Ask To Be Reseated Near A Door As The Main Restaurant Was Very Stuffy - Even The Waiting Staff Complained To Us About It (Which  While Conversational  Wasn't Perhaps The Most Professional).,,,,,
,1127,When Dining In The Manor  We Were Made To Feel Uncomfortable By Clearly Seeing A Senior Member Of Staff Chastising Waitresses For Not Doing Their Job Properly. This Spoilt The Atmosphere  And I Feel That If That Needs To Be Done It Should Not Be Done On The Restaurant Floor. ,,,,,
,1131,Dining At Le Blaireau Was A Very Pleasant Experience.  The Service Was Great And The Food Was Delicious.  The Food In The Zen Garden Was Also Very Nice.,,,,,
,1136,The Order Was Wrong And A Starter Missed  Another Starter Was Stone Cold And Little Apologies Given. Table Next To Us Also Had Same Issues And Became A Joke,,,,,
,1137,Made On Previous Form,,,,,
,1147,The Standard Of Food And Service Provided By Staff Was Excellent In The Brasserie.,,,,,
,1154,Food And Staff Excellent. ,,,,,
,1156,Excellent Evening Meal In The Manor Restaurant  Staff Very Attentive And Chatty Which Is Refreshing!,,,,,
,1157,We Ordered Pre Dinner Drinks In The Bar Which Led To Us Being Slightly Delayed In Going Through To The Restaurant. We Asked The Bar Tender To Phone Through To Advise That We Were In The Bar And Would Be About 10 Mins Late.  "You'll Have To Go To Reception" Was The Terse Reply.  I'll Leave It To You To Go Figure.,,,,,
,1159,This Is Our Third Stay  We Found The Bistro To Be The Most Pleasing Of All Our Dining Experiences.,,,,,
,1160,We Will Definatley Return With Friends,,,,,
,1162,The Bar Staff Was A Little Clinical.  Didn't Make Much Conversation.  We Asked For Olives But There Were No Cocktail Sticks And Serviettes Were Not Offered.,,,,,
,1164,Yes. We Noted Both Restaurants (The Manor Also) Had Disappointingly Limited Menus. We Were Going To Try Both But In The End Stayed With Le Blaireau. Didn't Particularly Feel French Despite The Decor And Two Nights Running Was The Same Specials Menu. Think Menu Should Seriously Be Considered To Be Expanded  Also The Manor.,,,,,
,1166,In The Manor Restaurant The Waiter Shared My Husbands Name (Daniel England) And We Had A Good Chat With Him. The Waitress (Eileen) Was Lovely.  We Enjoyed The Pianist  Who Was Also Playing Last Time We Stayed And Who Happily Played Our Requests. ,,,,,
,1167,Dinner In The Manor Restaurant Was Superb.  The Buffet Lunch In The Zen Garden Was A Little Disappointing.,,,,,
,1173,Zen Garden Needs Air Con And Food A Bit Expensive But French Restaurant Was Excellent!,,,,,
,1176,See Previous Comments,,,,,
,1179,Wonderful!,,,,,
,1181,Simply Amazing!,,,,,
,1183,Great Food - Service Could Have Been Slightly Quicker But Overall Great Experience,,,,,
,1189,Excellent Dining Experience. Food Was Outstanding,,,,,
,1190,Apart From Taking An Hour To Make A Panini In The Zen Garden Restaurant When It Wasn't That Busy The Food Was Very Nice,,,,,
,1192,The Food Was Lacking Flavour And Seasoning.,,,,,
,1195,No,,,,,
,1197,The Evening Meals Were Ok At Both The Main And French Restaurants. As I Cannot Remember Them They Were  To Me  Neither Exceptional Nor Poor  But As Expected. I Am Not A Fan Of Hot Breakfast Buffets So I Was Not That Impressed With The Cooked Breakfast. Fried Eggs In Particular Really Do Not Work Left Like That On A Hot Plate; They Just Rubberise. You Really Need To Do Something About The Toast. The Machine Kept Jamming And Frankly I Haven't Seen One Of Them In Years. May I Suggest Bringing Toast With The Tea/Coffee Order Would Be A Lot Easier For The Guests? ,,,,,
,1199,We Will Return As A Result Of Teh Dining Expereince.,,,,,
,1201,Some Of The Staff Could Have Been More Friendly And Helpful E.G. Not Keen To Bring Toast To The Breakfast Table For My Disabled Parents - Not Good I Thought.,,,,,
,1202,As Previously Stated The Food Was Poor,,,,,
,1203,Already Mentioned This In Detail ,,,,,
,1204,The Better Service And The Taste Were In The French Restaurant  The Your Service Is Not Bad But You Feel The Severance Of Masses.,,,,,
,1205,The Food Served At Zen Garden Was Exceptional.  Service Was A Little Frenetic (We Had To Ask For Some Water 3 Times) But Overall Very Friendly.  Our Server Very Kindly Pointed Out The Heat Of One Of The Dishes We Ordered  Which Gave Us The Opportunity To Request It Be Made Milder.,,,,,
,1208,Staff In Le Blaireau Made Children Feel Welcome.,,,,,
,1209,Some Of The Restaurant Staff Could Have Been Friendlier And The Service Could Have Been Quicker. ,,,,,
,1210,Service In Le Blaireau Could Not Be Faulted.  Very Enjoyable Experience And Excellent Food.  The Zen Garden Was Not Quite As Good As Twice They Forgot To Make Our Requested Smoothie And We Had To Ask For It Again.  Also  The Portions For Our Lunch Included In The Spa Break Were Very Small.,,,,,
,1213,The Manor Restaurant Was Disappointing When Compared To Other Double Aa Rosette Restaurants In The Local Area. The Service Could Have Been Better (Courses Were Not Explained By Waiting Staff) And The Prices Were Very Expensive In Comparison To Other Restaurants (E.G Anise At East Grinstead),,,,,
,1214,The Manor - The Hotel Was Notified By Email That One Guest Required Gluten-Free Meals. This Had Not Been Communicated To The Restaurant In Advance. We Waited At Least Half An Hour Beyond Our Booked Time To Be Seated. The Lady That Took Our Order Was Stressed And Distracted And Spoke To Us In A Very Off-Hand Manner. She Advised Us That My Friend Should Choose Something And Then She Would Go And Find Out If The Dish Was G/F. We Had To Ask For G/F Bread. Meal Was Mediocre And Certainly Not Fine Dining - People In Jeans And Tee Shirt  Very Dated And Unnecessary Piano Music. A Very Disappointing Experience.

Zen Restaurant Was A Complete Contrast - Someone Had Been Through The Menu With The Chef And Marked The G/F Dishes Before We Arrived. G/F Bread Was Brought To The Table Without Having To Ask For It. The Meal Was Excellent.,,,,,
,1216,Long Wait For Some Aspects Of Our Meal On The Sunday But Understand That This Was Due To A Computer Error.   However  There Should Have Been Better Communication Between The Chefs And The Front Of House Team Given How Busy The Restaurant Was That Night,,,,,
,1217,As Described In My Previous Comments,,,,,
,1218,We Had Breakfast In The Manor Restaurant Which We Were Very Much Looking Forward To However We Were Throughly Disappointed.  There Were A Lot Of Things That Were Not Available Like Clean Bowls (There Were Stacked Dirty Bowls By The Cereals)  No Croissants  Jam Or Marmalade.  When We Asked For These Things The Waitresses Were Rude (Not Helped By The Fact They Didn't Understand English Particularly Well) And Then Seemed To Forget Or Ignore Us As We Had To Ask Another 2-3 Times By Which Time Our Toast And Tea Had Turned Cold.  The Cooked Breakfast Was Also Cold So We Had To Ask For It To Be Reheated. They Did Then Offer To Cook It Again And It Still Came Out Luke Warm.  Overall  The Breakfast Let The Whole Stay Down The Most. If The Waitressing Staff Had Been More Friendly And Helpful And The Breakfast Had Been Better We Would Have Had A Much More Enjoyable Stay.,,,,,
,1219,Thai Restaurant Was Great But Manor Restaurant Wasn't.,,,,,
,1221,Decor Needs A Refresh  Loved The Live Piano,,,,,
,1223,Zen Were Very Helpful Fitting Me In At The Last Minuet. The Service At Breakfast Was Not Good  I Had To Ask Again For My Coffee Which Did Not Arrive As The Staff Were Too Busy Having A Flirt! Coffee On The First Day Was Cool. I Was Eating Alone And Felt That Some Attention To Put Me At My Ease Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,

,----------------------,,,,,,
,2,The Senspa Was Incredible  My Wife Said The Massage She Had Was The Best She Ever Had!,,,,,
,7,It Was Full - We Were Gutted.,,,,,
,9,Onsri Is A Thai Ninja At Massage! Amazing!! ,,,,,
,13,The Way The Staff Spoke To Us When Telling Us The Hydrotherapy Area Was Full Made Us Feel Stupid. We Were Really Disappointed And Instead Of Making Us Feel Better  The Staff Had An Air Of "Your Fault  Go Away Please",,,,,
,16,No .,,,,,
,25,Again  We Have Visited Several Spa's And This Was The Best!,,,,,
,27,More Rooms In The Hydrotherapy Area With More Themes. Bags For Wet Swimsuits Would Be Good,,,,,
,30,Excellent Spa,,,,,
,32,None-Don't Change What You Are Doing It All Works  We Were Never Left Wondering Where To Go  The "Green Tea" Was A Nice Touch Which Only Helped To Make The Experience More Relaxing. The Availability Of Tea And Coffee In The Upper Relaxing And Quiet Zones May Be Good As I Felt Guilty Calling Down To The Restaurant For A "Cuppa2 Whilst Chilling!,,,,,
,36,Wonderful Massage,,,,,
,39,Some Of The Rooms Could Be Really Interesting But They Don't Quite 'Work'. Either Literally (The Sauna With No Water) Or Figuratively (The Upstairs Rooms Which Were Warm But No-Where To Sit/No Actual 'Wow' Factor - And Why The Strange Hose In One Of Them? Slippery Pool Floor Too.,,,,,
,41,We Love Coming Here And Using The Spa Facilities.  It Is One Of The Highlights Of Our Year!,,,,,
,42,See Comments On First Page Re. Lockers,,,,,
,43,Having Experienced Other Spa Breaks With Other Providers Around The Uk  This Break Has Proved Exceptional. The Standard Throughout Is To Be Applauded.  Although The Packages On Offer Appear More Expensive Than Some  The Standard Provided Along With The Facilities  Proves To Be Very Good Value.,,,,,
,52,Clean  More Enjoyable Because It Wasn't Busy  Always Pool Loungers Available But Would  May Be A Good Idea To Get More For Peak Times Otherwise No Where To Sit Or Relax If You Do Not Want To Swim At A Certain Point. Changing Rooms Well Stocked. ,,,,,
,53,Spa Facilities Were Good However The Treatment Itself(Massage) Was Average And Not Worth The Price,,,,,
,59,Did Notice The Spa Reception  Staff Appeared Disinterested. Ie When We Requested Pool Shoes Were Just Told  Brusquely No Size 5 Or 6 You Will Have Go Bare Foot  Also We Asked For Access Code And Were Told We Didn't Need One  Only To Find We Required Scanner Bands And Had To Return Downstairs To Collect Them. The Rest Of Staff Encountered However Were Friendly And Extremely Helpful,,,,,
,61,Very Nice  Staff And Service  The  Hotels Saving Grace,,,,,
,66,I'd Like To Recognise Ying For Her Continually Superb Service.,,,,,
,67,Just Great!!,,,,,
,68,Amazing Place To Relax And Spend Quality Time Together.,,,,,
,71,Omg The Sensa Spa Was Our Favourite Part. A Heaven Of Relaxation  And High Quality Spa Facilities  Loved All Of It  Especially The Hydrotherapy Pool And The Tropical Shower Experience. ,,,,,
,72,Too Busy. Over Crowded. Not Peaceful ,,,,,
,73,The Environment Is So Clean And Fresh In Comparison With Other Spas,,,,,
,77,Only My Second Spa Experience But My Wife Has Been To Many. Overall I Enjoyed But Was Disappointed On A Few Points. Later In The Afternoon It Was Very Busy And At Time Felt Over Crowded. You Had Large Groups Of Females Who Were Loud And Not Helpful Towards Maintaining A Relaxed Environment. At No Point Was I Able To Obtain A Chair Of Bench Around The Pool As People Left Towels / Robes And As Such Blocked Seats.  My Wife Enjoyed Her Treatment When She Had A Full Body Massage.   I Would Also Recommend Putting Plastic Bags In Male Changing To Put Wet Swimwear In. Would Be An Nice Added Touch. Also Some Floor Mats As Floor Wet And You Had To Put Towels Down To Avoid Getting Feet And Clothes Wet When Getting Dressed. ,,,,,
,84,We Both Had Treatments Which We Were Happy With  But Thought They Were Fairly Expensive.  One Of My Wife's Treatments Was A Manicure Which She Was Happy With But Was Disappointed That You Did Not Offer Gel Nails...,,,,,
,93,We Spent Hours (Literally) Looking At Hundreds Of Different Spas Trying To Find One We Liked The Look Of That Had A Good Range Of Facilities.  When We Came Across Senspa We Knew It Was The Place We Wanted To Go And Were Not Disappointed!,,,,,
,95,I Feel That There Should Have Been More Water Fountains Around The Spa To Encourage People To Keep Hydrated.   I Took A 750Cl Bottle With Me And Needed To Refill It.,,,,,
,98,The Loungers Around The Main Pool Were Occupied Or Had People's Towels On Them  So We Could Not Sit Side By Side To Read By The Pool.,,,,,
,103,Dispense With The Armband Access. ,,,,,
,104,No Comments,,,,,
,106,A Truly Lovely Experience! Peaceful  Restful And A Pleasure From Start To Finish.,,,,,
,109,Excellent,,,,,
,110,The Stairs In The Hydrotherapy Area Were A Health Hazard As These Steps Are Not Of Equal Height. My Husband Tripped And Cut His Foot On One Step And We Saw Someone Else Tripping Over Them At The Same Spot.  The Men's Showers Did Not Look Inviting. Overall We Enjoyed Our Time In The Spa.,,,,,
,113,The Treatment This Time Was Not Quite So Good The Young Lady Was Not As Experienced - As The Treatments Are Expensive I Felt A Fraction Disappointed Compared To My Last Visit,,,,,
,126,Wouls Have Liked The Treatment In The Room To Know What Was Available Tp Book,,,,,
,129,The Facilities Of The Spa Are Amazing And The Cleanliness Is Fantastic  But Neither Of Us Were Blown Away By Our Treatments. We Had One Relaxation Massage And One Pregnancy Massage  Both Of Us Felt The Head Massage Part Of The Massage Was Rushed And A Little Pointless. Also My Pregnancy Massage The Room Was Uncomfortably Hot And The Room Felt Very Claustrophobic  I Had To Ask The Lady To Stop And Turn On The Air Con And Get Me Some Water  Which Wasn't Very Relaxing.  ,,,,,
,130,All Beautiful But Noticed The Special Showers Weren't Working Properly On Both Days.,,,,,
,132,More Water Points Inside The Sen Spa And The Hydrotherapy Suite  Poolside. More Towels Available Inside The Hydrotherapy . Very Slippery In Parts  Would Benefit From Having A Person To Monitor The Floors And Sweep Away Excess Water. Walking From The Pool  The Jacuzzi Overflowed Which Made It A Bit Tricky To Walk Through To Get To Toilets And Changing Room.,,,,,
,134,Very Good Overall. Perhaps Need More Beds Around The Main Pool. ,,,,,
,139,Very Easy To Get Lost - Always Reminds Me Of A First Day At A New School When You Don't Know Were Anything Is Located. Why Is It So Complicated ? Why Can't You Get Out Of The Door That You Came In ? Is The Layout Designed By The Person Who Designs Ikea So That You Have To Go Though All The Rooms ? Why No Water Dispenser By The Sauna / Steam Room By The Main Pool ?,,,,,
,143,Health Warnings Re Heart Conditions- From Hot To Cold! Partner Became Sick. ,,,,,
,150,We Paid A Hydro Upgrade Each Day During Our Stay Despite Having 3 Treatments Each. Treatments Are Not Cheap And We Felt Hydro Upgrade Should Be Waived If You Book 2 Treatments Or More Or Spend A Certain Amount ,,,,,
,152,Lord Gave Me A Fantastic Massage - It Was Wonderful.,,,,,
,153,Not To Have To Pay Extra On The Xmas Package For The Hydro.,,,,,
,159,Lord Has Magic Hands - The Thai Massage Was Amazing.,,,,,
,160,Was Very Busy  But Then The Hotel Was Full. However The Steam Room Which Seemed To Run On A Cycle Was Actually Perhaps Pushing The Limits On Heat When The Machine Was On. There Was No One In There; I Managed About 10 Minutes Then The Machine Turned Back On And I Had To Leave,,,,,
,164,My Only Comment Is You Had To Go Outside Into The Cold To Get To The Spa Reception,,,,,
,165,Quality Of Treatments Varies Terrifically Depending On The Therapist,,,,,
,174,Such Kind Young People. They Looked After My 93 Year-Old Mother-In-Law Very Well.,,,,,
,176,We Were On A Spa Break And We Found The Facilities And Range Of Treatments Excellent    .  Had 3 Treatments. . My Facial And Body One By Atom A Stand Out....  Some Constructive Feedback.....As My Husband And I Have Visited A Few Spas On Our Travels. .. The Treatment Rooms Felt A Little Cold On Entering And Didn't Have The Nice Relaxing Spa Smells ... Also A Nice Touch Esp When U R Face Down Rather Than Be Staring At A View Of The Floor Place An Ornate Bowl With Floating  Flower Petals,,,,,
,187,As Previously Mentioned We Were Not Impressed With The Charge For The Hydrotherapy Facilities And Not Being Able To Use The Quiet Room  Despite Having Treatments Booked.  Didn't Find The Spa Reception Staff Particularly Helpful As All Seemed Rather Preoccupied And Not At The Standard Of The Staff In The Rest Of The Hotel.  This Does Not Apply To The Staff Carrying Out The Treatments Who Were Friendly And Professional.,,,,,
,188,Some Things Have Been Left In A State Of Disrepair. Some Light Bulbs Need Changing  Some Of The Fountains In The Hot Rooms Didn't Work And The Showers Sometimes Weren't Working.,,,,,
,189,Can't Wait To Come Again!,,,,,
,192,I Have Been To Many Spa Hotels And Have Never Experienced A Two Tier System Where Guests Of The Hotel Are Excluded From Hydrotherapy Equipment. I Understand Treatments Are Separate And Should Be Chargeable  But Not Things Like Hydrotherapy Pools  Showers  Steam Rooms.,,,,,
,212,We Had Two Treatments  The Mud Room And Massage. The Massage Was Ok Not Spectacular. I Have A Lot So Do Know The Difference. The Girl Massaged Too Quickly  It Felt Too Routine. In Addition The Cloths We Laid On Did Not Feel Clean And Fresh And I Felt They May Not Have Been Changed Between Clients. That Made Me Less Relaxed Believing I Was Sharing Someone Elses Oil Etc! I Could Be Wrong Of Course But They Felt Greasy.,,,,,
,215,See Previous Comments. ,,,,,
,216,As A Glasses Wearer  I Have To Remove Them To Use The Facilities  It Was A Bit Of A Struggle Trying To Read Small Signs,,,,,
,217,Access To The Hydrotherapy Area Should Be Included For All Guests   Especially As Room Rates Are On The High Side,,,,,
,218,The Sauna Was V Small So Couldn't Fit More Than Two People And There Weren't Enough Seats Around The Pool.,,,,,
,219,Aimee Gave Me One Of The Best Massages Ive Ever Had,,,,,
,221,You Had An Excellent Shop/Sales Lady - So Sorry This Has Gone It Was Very Special With High Quality Good Design Products.,,,,,
,222,Nice For A Couple Of Hours Max  But Not Enough To Keep You For Longer.  I Would Have Been Disappointed If We Had Upgraded For A Whole Day Experience.,,,,,
,237,The Swimming Pool Could Be Slightly Warmer,,,,,
,239,Again The Staff Were Exceptional!  So Polite  Accomodating And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble!,,,,,
,240,Too Expensive For The Use Of The Hydrotherapy Facilities ,,,,,
,242,I Don't Think I'll Come For The Weekend Next Time As The Spa Was Rather Noisy On Saturday.  Even The Quiet Room Was Noisy.,,,,,
,244,Last Year We Forgot Our Swim Costumes And Were Able To Buy Them At The Little Shop. However I Noticed Very Few This Year And Was Told That They Were Being Phased Out In Favour Of Products  I Think This Is A Mistake As Anyone Should Be Able To Buy A Costume At The Spa If Like Us They Forget Them  It's Good Service. ,,,,,
,246,Acutally Very Nice Facilities,,,,,
,248,We Use Many Spa Facilities As We Travel Around The World And Have Got To Say That The Senspa  Is As Good As We Have Experienced Anywhere.,,,,,
,251,Excellent Spa Facilities  Mood Lighting In The Hydrotherapy Pool Was Most Relaxing  The Experience Showers Were Invigorating & Unique. Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Time.   However I Would Like To Bring To Your Attention Our Annoyance In The Fact That At Some Points The Adjoining Door Appeared Not To Lock So Several Of Those Not Wearing Bands Came Into The Facility  & Were Then "Stuck" When Attempting To Leave As The Door Had Now Locked & They Did Not Have A Band To Activate It. This Was Rather Disappointing After Paying To Upgrade To These Facilities. ,,,,,
,252,My Husband Had A Massage And Was Very Disappointed. He Said He Had To Wear Pyjamas - Which Is Completely Bizarre - And They Used No Oils. Sounds Like Torture To Me Rather Than A Pleasant Experience - Being Massaged Through Pyjamas?! We Paid For The Massage But He Wished He Had Questioned It As He Said It Was Pretty Rubbish. My Pregnancy Massage Was Very Good - Staff Were All Lovely. The Pedicure I Had Was Also Very Good. ,,,,,
,254,We Have Loved The Spa On Every Visit - I Do Hope  However  You Have A Program Of Refurbishment. Some Areas Around The Pool And In The Changing Areas Are Looking In Great Need Of Repair.,,,,,
,256,The Lady In Charge (Laura?) Was Excellent. She Went Out Of Her Way (On A Busy Day) To Ensure That We Were Happy. We Do Wonder How Well It Would Have Gone If She Was Not There. Hmmmmm.,,,,,
,257,Spa And Hydrothearpy Areas Were Over Crowded  Some Maintenance Issues Around The Pool Area  Water Damage To Ceiliings  ,,,,,
,258,Love The Hydrotherapy Spa - Very Relaxing.,,,,,
,259,Because I Stated I Had Used The Spa Once Before Myself And My Partner Were Not Shown Around The Facilities  Or Where The Lockers Etc Were.  I Also Found The Pool Area Extremely Tired And Rundown - Floor Tiles Are Covered In Water Marks  The Bamboo On The Sauna Is In Poor Condition And There Were A Lot Of Rust Marks Running Down The Walls.  I Also Found It Extremely Unprofessional That The Restaurant Were Using The Facilities At The Same Time As The Guests!!!,,,,,
,261,I Did Notice That Since Our Last Visit A Number Of Beauty Products Have Been Removed From The Ladies Changing Rooms.,,,,,
,268,I Have Concerns About The Advice/Guidance Given Regarding Footwear In The Hydrotherapy Spa. My Very Enjoyable Day In The Spa Was Slightly Spoiled Following A Slip While Descending The Staircase (Wet) Which Resulted In Bruising To My Right Upper Arm And Right Leg. I Was In Bare Feet At The Time  And I Believe That Non-Slip Footwear Is Essential To Avoid Slipping. I Realised Later That Pool Shoes Are Available From The Spa Reception But This Could Be Better Publicised - Perhaps With Signs In The Spa Area.,,,,,
,269,The Experience Was Ok  No Different To Any Other Spa  Definitely Not Exceptional.,,,,,
,272,The Pool Area Was A Mess Of Robes And Towels Piled Up On Lounges  Totally Detracted From The Serene Experience It Should Be. A Lot Of Spas Have A Row Of Hooks Or A Storage System Where You Can Place Your Towels Etc By The Pool Making It Much Tidier And Neater. ,,,,,
,277,The Friday Evening Hydrotherapy Session Was Quite Overcrowded,,,,,
,279,Not Enough Beds/Chairs To Relax In And Read The Paper. Staff Were A Bit Unorganised At The Heck In Stage Of Senspa. Didn't Tell Us We Had Juice Tea And Coffee In Our Package! Naughty!,,,,,
,280,Would Definitely Book And Use All The Facilities Again.,,,,,
,283,Mr Gentilli's Swedish Massage Was Apparently The Best He'd Ever Had.. High Praise Indeed - And He's Had A Fair Few! ,,,,,
,284,One Of The Best Massages I Have Ever Received.,,,,,
,303,Lack Of Choice For Treatments And Fully Booked On The Saturday - Disappointing. ,,,,,
,308,See Comment Re Treatments ,,,,,
,310,Very Relaxing And So Pleased You Do Not Allow It To Become Overcrowded,,,,,
,313,Very Slippery Floors. Nearly Fell Over A Few Times-Don't Know If There's Rubber Flip Flops That Could Be Given For Deposit Perhaps To Enable More Grip? ,,,,,
,317,On Arrival In Senspa We Were Told We Would Be Given A Tour Of The Spa Facilities But We Were Only Shown Briefly The Hydrotherapy Pool.  As It Was Our First Visit It Would Have Been Good To Have Been Shown The Full Facilities.,,,,,
,320,It Is A Bit Of A Rabbit Warren With Lots Of Stairs! ,,,,,
,322,I Went Down To Use The Extra Facilities That We Had Paid For On The Sunday Morning Only To Be Told That The Day Pass Of 35 Pounds Each Was Now Invalid! I Find This A Little Disappointing Considering The Joint Cost Of 70 Pounds  And The Fact That You Cannot Check In Until 3Pm. I Don't Think That To Use The Extra Facilities Before 11Am Checkout Would Be Unreasonable.,,,,,
,326,Please See Original Comment,,,,,
,327,I Had Forgotten To Bring Some Swimming Shorts. The Staff Leant Me A Pair From Lost Property. I Thought This Was Very Kind Instead Of Making Me Buy A Pair. ,,,,,
,331,Good Facial's But The Massage Wasn't As Relaxing.. But Great Staff.,,,,,
,333,As Previously Mentioned 3 Rd Visit But Let Down By Treatment Booking System And Increased Number Of Visitors In Spa On Saturday. ,,,,,
,336,It Is A Wonderful Place To Relax And Unwind - Without Our Children!,,,,,
,342,The Only Thing We Can Say Is That It Was Rather Busy In The Hydrotherapy Area On This Particular Stay  But We Did Still Enjoy Our Stay,,,,,
,343,A Mistake Was Made On Our Booking Day Which Messed Up Our Plans For The Sat  We Arranged A Treatment For The Friday But Unfortunately This Wasn't The Case And The Only Other Option Was 6.15Pm On Sat Eve !,,,,,
,344,A Most Enjoyable Day And I Look Forward To Visiting Again Soon.,,,,,
,350,Age Of The Pool Showing Itself Re Holes/Damaged/Streaked Ceiling Plasterwork.,,,,,
,355,The Communication Between Restaurant And Spa Could  Be Improved. We Were Not Made Aware We Could Order Food To Be Sent Up To The Quiet Areas In The Spa,,,,,
,357,We Ought To Have Booked More Before The Date. It Was All My Treat So I Was Going To Buy 6 Treatments. 3 Each But The Discount Of 5% Was Per Person Rather Than For The Person Paying. ,,,,,
,361,Overall Great Facilities   Just A Few Points...

- Busier Than Expected. Deliberately Booked On A Sun/Mon So That It Would Be Quiet  But The Hydro Area Was Very Busy. Struggled To Find Somewhere To Hang Our Towels.
- Pool/Hydro Areas Were Noisy With People Talking Loudly. Perhaps To Encourage A Tranquil Atmosphere  Guests Should Be Reminded That They Should Keep It Down A Bit. There Were Also Grown Men Having Races And Doing Handstands In The Pool (Not Particularly Relaxing!)
- German Style Reserving Of Beds Is Annoying.  For A Full Hour  Every Bed By The Pool Was Empty Aside From A Strategically Placed Towel/Gown.
- Please Buy Some Mens Mags For The Pool Area  My Husband Could Find Nothing To Read.,,,,,
,364,We Were Glad We Didn't Pay To Use The Hydrotherapy Pool  As It Was Very Busy - Sometimes We Had The Leisure Pool To Ourselves! The Pool Was Clean And There Were No Heistations In Using Any Of The Facilities Concerned.
The Treatments Were Good - We Had A Mud Treatment And Then A Back  Neck And Shoulder Massage,,,,,
,373,Quite Expensive For A Manicure,,,,,
,374,Over All Experience Was Excellent.,,,,,
,375,Enjoyed Our Stay So Much Ended Up Staying Two Nights Instead Of One.,,,,,
,378,The Sauna Was Very Tiny  Back Stress Massage Average  But Foot Massage Excellent!,,,,,
,383,Massage Was Brilliant. The Facilities Were Just Amazing  Could Not Have Been More Relaxed. ,,,,,
,392,We Particularly Enjoyed The Hydrotherapy Pool  Only Once In The 2 Days We Used All The Facilities Did We Find The Room We Wanted To Go Into Full  ,,,,,
,396,We Found That The Level Of Service To The Relaxing Area Was Very Poor.Had To Ask For The Cold Drinks To Be Refilled.We Had A Coffee And When We Returned Some 2 Hours Later Noticed That The Cups Were Still As We Had Left Them On The Table.,,,,,
,398,As Previously Mentioned  Some Treatment Costs Were A Little Overpriced. I Certainly Would Have Booked A Manicure Along With My Massage If It Had Been A Little Less Pricey. Everything Else Was Lovely  Including Changing Facilities. ,,,,,
,401,Too Busy,,,,,
,402,The Spa Seemed Very Busy Over The Weekend.   I Went To Go Swimming On The Saturday But Was Put Off By About 8 People Being In The Pool And All The Chairs Taken  The Sauna And Jacuzzi Both Full As Well.   My Wife Was Told There Was No Space Left For A Massage During The Time Of Our Visit.   She Only Got Squeezed In On The Sunday Evening After Complaining That This Was One Of The Main Reasons For Booking.,,,,,
,408,There Were Not Enough Loungers Around The Pool And As Already Stated We Were Hoping To Upgrade To Use The Rest Of The Facilities But Were Appalled At How Expensive It Was.,,,,,
,409,I Have A Disability And Found That There Were Not Enough Lifts To Help Me Negotiate The Spa And Hotel.  I Was Unable To Go Upstairs To The Laconicum  And Tepidarium As The Stairs Were Too Difficult To Negotiate.,,,,,
,410,Best Facial I've Had,,,,,
,411,Can't Wait To Come Again! ,,,,,
,413,My Daughter Had Never Been To A Spa Before  So This Was A Treat For Her.  We Both Enjoyed All The Facilities  Especially The Hydrotherapy Pool  The Crystal Steam Room And The Room With The Heated Chairs Which Sent Us Both To Sleep - Bliss!,,,,,
,414,My Sister And I  Both Fit And Well On Arrival At Careys  Have Both Experienced Infections The Day After Returning Home  Me A Stomach Bug  Which I Am Still Suffering From Today And My Sister A Throat Infection.  My Doctor Suggested I Let You Know About This As A Matter Of Courtesy. But We Couldn't Fault The Spa Experience.,,,,,
,417,Staff Should Regularly Attend In All Areas. A Big Party Arrived During Our Stay And Were Very Loud In Hydrotherapy Area When People Were Trying To Relax. Couldn't Find Anyone To Notify At The Time,,,,,
,423,We Had The Mud Rassousaul Had At Another Spa Previously Where It Was 45 Mins This Was Only 30 Mins Water Trickled Out So Didn't Even Wash Mud Of Properly,,,,,
,425,I Was Very Uncofortable To Be Asked (When Signing For Payment Of My Treatment) On The Form About Leaving A Tip - It Was Infront Of The Therapist And I Feel Within The Beauty Industry Tipping Is At Absolute Discression  Unlike When Dining. Treatment Was Very Good But Also Very Expensive So I Decided Not To Leave A Tip  But To Have To Openly Make That Choice Infront Of The Therapist Was A Poor Customer Experience And Definetly Detracted From The Overall Senspa Experence. The Spa Was Also Busy  The 'Check-In' Members Of Staff Werent Very Attentive And We Had To Go Back To Ask How To Enter The Spa And What To Do Next As We We Were Just Given Bands And Left.,,,,,
,430,Fantastic Facilities,,,,,
,431,The Spa Is Fantastic And One Of The Reasons I Chose To Stay With You. I Am A Therapist Myself So I Am Extremely Fussy When It Comes To Treatments. Needless To Say They Were Very Good And My Partner Even Managed To Fall Asleep In His. He Said His Therapist Amy Put Him At Ease (As He Was A Little Nervous Being His First Proper Treatment).,,,,,
,433,Very Nice Experience In The Quiet Room.,,,,,
,435,Already Mentioned In Previous. We Took Our Dressing Gowns Off And Went In Pool  Saw A Couple Looking Maybe Because They Thought We Had Not Showered. But Lack Of Contact And Explanation We Hadn't Had Them Pointed Out To Us  If So We Would Have Definitely Gone Into The Shower First. Lucky We Had Only Just Had A Shower And Are Clean People.Also We Didn't Even Know That There Were Changing Rooms Available. ,,,,,
,437,Seemed To Be Very Busy On The Friday Morning When The Hydrotherapy Seemed Over Crowded  Fine After That First Morning.,,,,,
,445,Enjoyed The Spa But Feel Looking Around It Does Not A Bit Of A Face Lift In Certain Areas. Ie. Poor Decor In Pool Area Paint Stained And Peeling From Walls. ,,,,,
,446,Having Paid For An Overnight Stay And Additional Treatments  I'm Not Sure That Paying An Extra £25 Each Was Value For Money For Use Of The Hydrotherapy Facilities.,,,,,
,448,At The Time The Ladies Changing Rooms Were Very Untidy With Wet Towels And Dressing Gowns Left Over The Place  A Lot Of The Lockers Did Not Have Pins In The Keys So It Was Difficult To Put The Key Anywhere.

A Good Idea To Look At The Swimming Pool Ceiling By The Steps Needs Attention.,,,,,
,449,The Therapists Were Great,,,,,
,450,I Could Not Be Happier With The Spa Facilities.,,,,,
,453,We Both Had Lovely Massages.,,,,,
,454,I Loved Every Minute,,,,,
,455,Again Very Dated,,,,,
,463,Amazing As Always. ,,,,,
,466,We Did Not Have Any Treatments So Can't Comment On Those  But The Pool And Hydrotherapy Facilities Were Wonderfful,,,,,
,468,Again  We Wouldn't Say The Spa Experience Was 'Exceptional'. It Was Of A High Standard. ,,,,,
,472,Poole Area And Changing Rooms Were Clean And Tidy,,,,,
,477,We All Loved It.,,,,,
,484,Love It!,,,,,
,486,Only Slight Issue Is That There Were Not Enough Beds To Go Around And A Lot Of People Were Complaining About This. Also I Was Disappointed To Hear That We Had To Pay Extra To Go Into The Sen Spa Bit When Booking The Hotel It Was One Of Reasons We Chose It And Didn't Realise It Would Cost Extra To Use These Facilities. Especially When The Room Price Wasn't Exactly Cheap It Should Have Been Covered In The Room Cost. ,,,,,
,487,As Stated Previously  Disappointed With The Spa Facilities Was We Expected In Our Package To Be Able To Use All The Facilities For The Price If Cost For A Night!,,,,,
,491,The Relaxation Room Was Not Well Serviced On The Sunday Of Our Stay. There Were Dirty Cups Everywhere And People Kept Trying To Get Tea/Coffee And This Was Not Refreshed  Nor Were There Any New Cups  For About An Hour. I Understand You Could Call Down For This  But I Did Not Want A Drink  I Just Kept Being Disturbed By People Trying The Jugs And Complaining To Each Other.

Hydrotherapy Treatments Were All Good And Rooms (E.G. Sauna  Steam Room Etc.) Were All Very Spacious.

My Treatments Were Fine. I Was Disappointed With The Rassoul. I Thought For That Price That Someone Would Administer The Mud And Do Something Like Wrap/Massage You Etc. My Partner And I Could Not Believe It When We Walked Into A Room And For £70 Were Given Two Pots Of Mud And Left Alone. Perhaps This Is Clear From The Website To Other  But I Did Not Appreciate This From The Description.,,,,,
,495,Fantastic To Have So Many Facilities In Such Proximity And Really Easy To Spend Hours And Hours And Hours There......,,,,,
,496,Not Enough Chairs Round The Pool And Those That Are There Are Really Uncomfortable ,,,,,
,502,We Were So Disappointed By The Pol  Steam Room And Hot Tub We Had On The Night Of Our Arrival  We Decided Not To Use The Hydrotherapy Facilities Or The Take The Mud Treatment The Next Day And I Am Pleased We Had As We Would Have Been Charged An Extra £79 Pounds.,,,,,
,503,The Best Spa I've Ever Been To.,,,,,
,508,I Could Not Get A Treatment So Was Very Disappointed,,,,,
,509,None To Report.  Excellent. ,,,,,
,510,I Just Love It!
We Were Expecting A Two Hour Evening Slot For The Hydro But As It Was Quiet We Were Upgraded When We Arrived To 4 Hours. Nice Touch,,,,,
,516,None.  Just Perfect And Atmospheric,,,,,
,525,Again We Must Mention The Lovely Staff   So Knowledgeable And Helpful. We Will Be Back.,,,,,
,534,Of A Much Higher Standard Than The Hotel Itself,,,,,
,536,I Felt As A Hotel 3 Night Resident A Little Out Of The Loop In Comparison To Spa Day Visitors.Thank Goodness One Of Your Therapist Advised Us To Use Facilities At 7 Am. Otherwise We Would Be Very Disappointed.A Gentle Reminder Verbally To Hotel Guests That These Facilities Do Get Busy At Certain Hours Will Be Very Useful.
Our First Night We Turned Back To The Room  After Seeing I Busy.
Saturday There Was A Hen Do On In The Spa.
The Place Was So Packed And I Found Plastic Cups Among My Towels .Also Visitors Didn't Seem To Understand The Etiquette Attached To A Spa.
Also I Found It Very Hard To Find Out Exactly What An Upgrade Included.
I Would Have Liked To Been Asked About Going To A Class. I Think If Residents Decide To Up .
Also A Thank You At End Of Our Visit Would Be Nice Between My Parter And Myself
We Spent Over £ 500 Worth Of Treatments .The Therapists Were The Best Part And The Hydro.
I Love Your Spa . But Just Little Tweeks Need To Be Made.
I Didn't  Feel. As Special As A Day Spa Person.,,,,,
,537,The Spa Has The Potential To Be Excellent. There Was Water Leaking From The Roof  There Were Wet Used Towels Lying Around Everywhere And Not Enough Seating.,,,,,
,545,Refreshments In The Spa Refreshments Room Were Not Topped Up Regularly Enough  There Was Juice Etc But Nothing Whatsoever To Eat  A Biscuit Or Fruit Would Not Have Gone Amiss.,,,,,
,546,I Had A Massage With Lucy Which Was Very Relaxing.,,,,,
,553,Just Amazing!! So Relaxing And Lovely!,,,,,
,555,The Pool Beds Need To Have The Used Towels Removed Where Lazy Guests Have Not Placed Them In The Basket Provided. It Appeared That All The Beds Were Occupied  But Were Not!!,,,,,
,564,A Truly Exceptional Spa; So Much To Do; Lovely. However Our Itinerary Should Surely Have Been Emailed Before We Left - I Didn't Realise We Had Use Of Spa From 9 Am  And All Day Friday. Also A Class Timetable. It's Probably On The Website But It Would Have Been Good To Have It Spelled Out For Us In The Confirmation Mails. Trying To Read All The Small Printed Forms In The Low Light Without Our Reading Specs Was Tricky! Anyway  We Had Lots Of Lovely Time In The Spa And Left Feeling Really Relaxed. Thank You. ,,,,,
,573,No Other Comment To Make.,,,,,
,577,My Girlfriend Thoroughly Enjoyed Her Treatments And Was Chilled For The Rest Of The Day. Said The Person Who Treated Her Was Very Attentive.   I Used The Gym Which Was Well Appointed.   Only Minor Point Could Do With More Loungers And Chairs In The Pool Area.  Couple Of Times We Had To Wait For Someone To Leave Before There Was Someone To Sit,,,,,
,578,No,,,,,
,580,We Had The Rhassoul Treatment But One Of The Shower/Mist Wasn't Working Properly So We Were Quite Disappointed. The Treatment Wasn't Very Well Explained Either. It Was A Shame As We Were Really Looking Forward To It. The Rest Of The Facilities At Senspa Were Very Good.,,,,,
,582,The Senspa Offers A Wide Variety Of Treatments And The Spa Is One Of The Best That We Have Been To. The Staff Are Friendly And Attentive.,,,,,
,587,As I've Previously Mentioned  It Would Have Been Brilliant To Have Been Allowed Access Into The Spa Pools Etc As A Two Night Guest Etc.,,,,,
,591,Very Comfortable And Clean,,,,,
,592,Unfortunately  We Did Not Get Much Time To Spend At The Spa As We Mainly Came For A Cycling Holiday.  The Packages Looked Very Good Though.,,,,,
,593,We Were Told By The Receptionist-Not Sure Of Her Name-Short Hair With Glasses- At The Spa To Wait Outside The Rassoul Room For Our Treatment-Which We Did For 20 Mins And Noone Came. After This I Went Down To Reception And Was Told -Really Rudely By ? Katy That We Should Have Come To Reception And That She Hadn't Been Told That We Would Be Waiting In The Spa. By Chance Another Member Of Staff Overheard And Apologised-But It Was A Really Nasty Experience.,,,,,
,601,The Only Comment I Have Is Being Able To Get From The Changing From Room To The Spa As I'm Disabled And Find Stair Very Difficult You Should Have The Facility To Use Lift.,,,,,
,613,Sadly My Wife Had Cause For Complaint And The Cost Of Her Treatments Were Cleared From Our Deoarting Bill. The Assistant Manager Did This Without Question And Is To Be Commended On His Courteous Service,,,,,
,617,The Hydrotherapy Facilities Were Brilliant.   Unfortunately What Was An Otherwise Lovely Afternoon Was Slightly Spoilt Because Although I Am Positive That When I Made The Booking I Made It Clear That I Wanted Both The Slimming Massage And The Slimming Wrap When The Therapist Completed The Wrap It Was Clear That The Treatment Was Over.  I Queried This With The Spa Reception And Was Told The Booking Showed As Just The Slimming Wrap.  My Suggestion Is That When A Booking Is Made A Confirmation Email Is Sent - Had That Happened I Would Have Picked Up The Error In Time To Do Something About It Whereas It Was Too Late On The Day.,,,,,
,618,Clean And Well Provided With Towels.  Again Friendly Staff.,,,,,
,619,Fantastic Clean Facilities  Great Team Of Staff Working There! One Particular Eastern European Young Lady With Brown Hair Was Exceptional Hard Working My Apologies For Not Getting Her Name But On Saturday Night Following Her Shift At The Spa Also Served At The Restaurant What Impressed Me Was After Working A Whole Day She Was Still Smiling And Professional She Is An Asset To Your Hotel ( She Said She Had A Six Year Old Son  I Noticed When She Was Working At The Spa She Does Not Wear Shoes If That Is A Helpful Clue To Gage Her Identity? I Was Truly Impressed By Her!!!!!,,,,,
,621,Changing Rooms Need Upgrading,,,,,
,627,No. It's Very Enjoyable.,,,,,
,628,Sadly This Was Not Reflected In The Spa Where My Initial Disappointment At Not Being Able To Book A Double Massage Session For Both My Husband And Myself Was Met With A Defensive Attitude And Advising Me That The Spa Had 20 Therapists On And That People Book Months In Advance As If "I Should Know" This Continued Throughout My Massage Which Was Perfunctory With No Effort To Put Me At My Ease  I Was Initially Asked To Remove My Clothes With No Effort To Protect My Modesty With A Towel.  I Felt Uncomfortable Throughout The Massage With The Earlier Disappointment Alluded To Several Times Causing Me Further Embarrassment. At The End Of The Treatment I Was Given No Opportunity To Rest And Recover But Was Rushed To Get Straight Up As Soon As The Massage Was Finished.,,,,,
,634,Lovely New Products And Very Helpful Advice From Monica In The Spa Shop,,,,,
,636,As Always  A Lovely Experience.  The Treatments Were Exceptional - I Feel This Is The Best Level Of Treatment I Have Had Anywhere Else In The Uk.,,,,,
,640,Just Wow!,,,,,
,641,Best Spa We Have Ever Been To. Treatments Outstanding. My Husband Would Like To Say A Special Thank You To Nuch For The Best Massage He Has Ever Had.,,,,,
,646,I Thought It Was Very Good.,,,,,
,655,Initial Greeting Not As Good As Previous Visit - No Welcome Tea  Had To Ask For Robe And Sign For Sandals - Attention To Detail ,,,,,
,661,Facilities Are Good And Have Used Them Before So Know What To Expect. Treatment Wasn't As Good As Ones I've Had Previously ,,,,,
,667,I Would Hv Liked More Fitness Classes. ,,,,,
,669,Thank You For A Wonderful Few Hours On Sunday - We Felt So Relaxed!,,,,,
,670,Mostly Very Good. I Fedback On Checkout That My Daughters Masseur Didn't Respond Sufficiently To Her Request For A Lighter More Relaxing Massage During Her Bespoke Massage. She Was Left Feeling Uncomfortable And More Tense. She's Not One To Complain So Didn't Feel Able To Say Anything Further After Mentioning It Twice During The Massage. She Did Emphasise That The Masseur Was Very Nice And Polite And Maybe Just Didn't Understand What My Daughter Was Saying. ,,,,,
,673,This Was One Of The Highlights Of Our Stay. The Pool And Jacuzzi Were Lovely And Quiet And Conveniently Placed. We Then Spent Half A Day Using The Hydroptherapy Facilities Which Were Fantastic - Beautifully Kept  Friendly Staff  A Superb Range Of Rooms And Experiences. We Would Love To Return And Use These Facilities Again.,,,,,
,683,It Is A Shame You Do Not Have Any Outdoor Beds On A Hot Day  As Experienced At Other Spa Hotels,,,,,
,684,Changing Rooms And Toilets Should Be On Each Floor. Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Garden To Sit Out In. I Thought It Was Over Priced.,,,,,
,689,The Receptionist Didn't Seem Able To Advise On Any Specific Treatments  Nor Did The Medical Cards Make Much Sense As No Questions Were Asked About What Had Been Completed On Them

It Would Be Very Helpful If Staff At The Senspa Would Remove Towels Or Other Items Which Were Being Used To Reserve Chairs Or Loungers From Around The Pool Area On A Regular Basis,,,,,
,690,Was Absolutely Perfect And Can't Wait To Return ,,,,,
,691,The Loos In The Ladies Changing Room Needs Hooks On The Backs Of The Doors (They Have Obviously Been There Before But Are No Longer).,,,,,
,702,Not Very Clean  Now Bag For Wet Costumes? And No Seats To Relax On After Swimming Etc. ,,,,,
,720,Disappointing For The Prices Charged For Treatments Etc,,,,,
,733,Drab Surroundings By Hydropool.  General Experience Was Overrated By The Hotel,,,,,
,735,Shame There Are Not More Loungers. I Liked The Selection Of Papers And Magazines That Are Available ,,,,,
,736,After My Treatment I Went To One Of The Quiet Rooms. I Would Have Liked A Towel To Drape Over The Day Bed As It Felt 'Sticky' From Previous Use And Did Not Look Very Clean.The Table For 'Help Yourself' Drinks Was Messy And Had Not Been Replenished.,,,,,
,739,Great Experience ,,,,,
,740,The Pool Could Have Been Slightly Warmer,,,,,
,746,As With The Hotel Staff  The Sen Spa Staff And Therapists Were All Friendly And Helpful And Very Knowledgeable About Their Product Ranges.  The Facilities Were Exceptional.,,,,,
,747,Could Not Fault My Treatments  Exceptional.,,,,,
,749,Treatments Very Expensive,,,,,
,752,As I Said Accessibility A Bit Of A Problem For Walking Difficulties Because Of All The Stairs And Very Few Lifts. . Many Would Be Unable To Use The Upstairs Facilities In The Spa Suite At All  Including The Disabled Toilet. It Seemed A Bit Thoughtless For The Disabled Toilet To Be Only Accessible If You Could Walk Up The Stairs  But Not If You Were In A Wheelchair.
















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































As I Have Said Accessibility A Bit Of A Problem For Those With Walking Difficulties Due To All The Stairs And Not Many Lifts. For Both My Treatments I Was Taken Up And Down Several Flights Of Stairs In Spite Of My Walking Difficulties Being Obvious. After My Second Treatment On The Tuesday I Found Another Route Back Involving Very Few Stairs So That Was A Bit Thoughtless Of Them  Particularly As I'd Been Assured The Previous Day That I Would Get A Ground Floor Treatment Room.


,,,,,
,760,No Towel Or Robe In Changing Room  Meaning I Had To Get Changed Back Into Clothes Before Next Treatment. Kind Of Ruined The Experience To Be Honest.,,,,,
,765,A Couple Of Times On Previous Visits  It Was Noted Things In The Spa Were Starting To Show Signs Of Age Or Weren't Working Properly - It Was Nice To See These Have Been Fixed Now And Senspa Is Back To Its Excellent Standard Again,,,,,
,767,I Always Love The Spa And Treatments. I Did Notice Some Deterioration In The Standard Of Cleanliness  The Rim Around The Edge Of The Hydrotherapy Pool Was In Need Of A Clean  When Still In The Hydrotherapy Pool We Noticed Debris Under The Bed. The Floor In The Experience Showers Also Looked Grub Bier Than On Prior Visits. The Ceiling In The Shower In The Ladies Changing Room Had Black Mould On It. Finally The Woven Decor On The Left Hand Side Of The Door To The Garden Area In The Swimming Pool Area Was Displaced And Tatty.,,,,,
,769,I Have Visited Many Spa Hotels And Feel This Was Not On Par With Any If Them Which Was A Real Shame. The Treatments That We Had Were Very Expensive. It Most Certainly In My Opinion Was Not Value For Money. My Treatment Was 20Mins Which Actually Ended Up Being 15Mins & Was Not Relaxed At All. The Pool Area Felt Small With Not Enough Relaxing Chairs. Having To Go Upstairs Through The Changing Area Every Time You Wish To Leave That Area Was Really Annoying Especially For A More Elderly Person. Really Felt It Was All Too Much Effort For A Relaxing Day In And Would Not Recommend This To Friends At All.,,,,,
,770,We Had Booked Our Facials And Massages At 10.00 On The Friday Which Was The Day After We Arrived But The Spa Had Us Booked For 2.15 Which We Would Never Have Agreed To As We Were Going Out For The Day. The Staff Did Rearrange Our Facials For Late In The Afternoon And Our Massages For The Saturday Morning And Actually Changed My Mother's Massage For A File And Polish And Refunded The Difference. We Were Satisfied With The Outcome.,,,,,
,775,A Bit Tight On Seating. People Sitting On The Upright Chairs At One End Of The Spa Could Easily Trip Up People Walking Past. Accept The Space Is Limited For Lounge Seating.,,,,,
,779,Fantastic Staff.,,,,,
,783,None,,,,,
,786,Wonderful Facilities And Range If Treatments ,,,,,
,788,The Staff Were Very Professional And Sensitive Dealing With The Sizing Of The Dressing Gowns And Did Their Utmost To Accommodate Us .,,,,,
,799,Weve Been To Sen Spa 5 Times And Love It Each And Every Time. Even Without Treatments Its A Lovely Day And Reasonable Priced As We Stayed At The Hotel (£25 Each For Half Day). ,,,,,
,803,We Took Benefit From The Thassoul Mud Treatment Which Was Very Good And Hilarious!  Unfortunately The Door To The Room Was Not Functioning So We Had To Call Reception To Be Let Out Of The Hydrotheraphy Facilities Area As We Did Not Have A Wrist Band.  Which Turned Out To Be A Little Problematical As The Phone Wasn't Working.,,,,,
,808,It Was Clean And The Hydrotherapy Rooms Were Ok. It Didn't Feel Luxurious  Though  And Could Do With More Variety. The Pool Was Nice  But Not Enough Seats/Benches.,,,,,
,811,On Both Occasions We Were Not Shown The Facilities As Stated ,,,,,
,814,The Hour Massage Turned Out To Be 43 Mins Of Actual Massage !,,,,,
,817,Only Slight Negative Was A Relatively Hard Sell To Buy Products At The End Of The Session.,,,,,
,818,Excellent,,,,,
,822,Treatments Were Slightly Disappointing And Didn't Match Similar Treatments In My Own Local Spa.,,,,,
,826,Very Relaxing  We Didn't Manage To Use The Gym  Which I Was Annoyed With Myself About As I Should Have Made More Of An Effort.  When I Looked At  It Though  It Did Look Good.  I Especially Enjoyed The Steam Room.  My Partner Could Only Really Use The Swimming Pool  Which Was A Little Cold At First.  The Jacuzzi Was Good Too!  
We Both Had Treatments  I Had A Facial  Which Was The First Time I Have Experienced Any Thing Like That But I Would Have A Treatment Again  It Was Nice To Be Pampered So I Am Glad That My Partner Insisted!  She Really Enjoyed Her Pregnancy Massage And Said It Was Relaxing.,,,,,
,827,So Much Better Than Other Spa Experiences We've Had. Space  Neat And Most Of All Quiet... Areas To Sit & Talk Without Feeling Overlooked,,,,,
,828,Shame No Space Outside To Relax In Apart From In The Zen Restaurant Area And They Didn't Particularly Like You Sitting There.  The Staff Coming In And Out Of The Relaxation Room (Quiet Room) Need To Be Quiet Themselves.  Relaxation Rooms Too Hot And Stuffy.  Bands Did Not Work Properly And I Was Stuck In The Hydrotherapy Area Untill Someone Else Came In.  Good Sauna And Steam Rooms But Would Not Want To Be In The Spa On A Busy Day As Room Around The Pool And Hydrotherapy Area Limited.,,,,,
,829,Treatments Too Expensive & No Offers Available When We Booked.,,,,,
,830,Becomes Very Busy After 4Pm,,,,,
,835,Treatments Are A Bit Too Expensive ,,,,,
,840,Staff Very Friendly. Massage Therapist Was Sarah Who Was Very Friendly & Helpful - Amazing Massage! ,,,,,
,841,No Air Conditioning In Changing Rooms Making It Very  Very Hot And Unpleasant. Lovely Spa Area But Changing Rooms Could Do With Updating To Reflect 4* Rating Of Hotel ,,,,,
,843,So Relaxing  We Spend 2 Hours In The Hydrotherapy Spa!,,,,,
,845,Absolutely Loved It. Treatments Were Indulgent And Fantastic. Staff Were Always Helpful. Facilities Brilliant. The Only Negative Was The Limited Number Of Beds Around The Pool.,,,,,
,853,As Usual All Very Friendly And We Both Had Excellent Treatments,,,,,
,856,It Was Not Made Plain On Your Website That Our Price Did Not Include The Senspa And That We Would Have To Pay An Extra £25. Also On Asking  We Were Advised By Staff On The Desk There That We Could Use Our Bracelets The Next Day  We Were Not Told That This Would Entail An Extra £25 Charge. The Facilities In The Spa Were Excellent But The Sauna + Steam Room By The Leisure Pool Were Not  They Are Way Too Small.,,,,,
,861,Could Be Amazing  But There Needs To Be Clear Standards Of Behaviour For Guests  Standards That Needs To Be Enforced. ,,,,,
,872,Having To Go Through The Changing Rooms To Exit The Spa Just To Pop Back To Our Rooms Was A Little Tedious.,,,,,
,874,Amazing Experience All Round,,,,,
,877,The Girls Were Very Polite And Helpful.  The Girls Who Gave Us A Massage Were Very Good.,,,,,
,886,Hydrotherapy Facilities Should Have Been Included In The Room Rates ,,,,,
,887,As Already Stated,,,,,
,889,Very Relaxing !,,,,,
,890,Overall Experience Was Excellent. One Thing I Would Say Though Is The Lack Of Cold Water In The Hydrotherapy Area. The Drinking Water Fountains Were Warm And Even When I Let The Water Run For A While  It Didn't Turn Cold. We Had The Same Problem In The 'Ice Shower' With The Sound And Light Effects - A Lovely Experience  But Again  The Water Was Not Cold  So Not Really A Ice Shower! Perhaps A Maintenance Issue Here...? ,,,,,
,891,Fabulous; As Good As  Or In Some Ways Better Than Chewton Glen,,,,,
,892,Excellant. We Usually Visit 2 Or 3 Spas A Year So Have Seen Lots Of Different Set Ups. It Would Be Nice To Have A Small Outside Water Spa Area If You Are Ever Able To Improve The Facilities.,,,,,
,907,In The Past I Had Several Treatments In Several Hotels. Senspa Is In Comparison Really Outstanding. ,,,,,
,908,Relaxing Experience ,,,,,
,909,Superb!,,,,,
,913,The Facilities Were Excellent. My Wife And I Enjoyed The Spa Together   I Used The Gym Which Was Fine And My Wife Was Very Pleased With The Treatments She Had  Particularly The Two Massage Treatments. The Only Slight Disappointment Was That It Was Not Possible To Include Any Of These In A Special Price Package At The Time Of Booking  The Requirement Was To Pay Full Price. It Was Also A Bit Confusing Before We Arrived To Understand The Difference Between The (Free) Leisure Facilities And The (Chargeable ) Spa Facilities.  We Saw That Other People Were Surprised That They Had To Pay Extra.,,,,,
,920,We Found The Hydrotherapy Pool Was Lovely  But As Previously Stated  I Didn't Find The Spa Any More Luxurious Than My Local Virgin Active,,,,,
,923,The Sauna Didn't Seem To Get Very Hot? ,,,,,
,925,We Had A Bad Experience With The Mud Treatment As The Machine Did Not Come On  We Had No Way To Know How Long We Had Been In There. A Sand Timer Or Clock Would Have Been Helpful.
We Also Felt That There Weren't Many Lower Priced Treatments Available.,,,,,
,926,Yes We Loved The Hydrotherapy Experience Just Unfortunate That We Were Unable To Have A Treatment As The Spa Was Fully Booked.,,,,,
,927,I'll Be Back  Lovely Facilities  And Staff,,,,,
,937,Just Wonderful.,,,,,
,948,Very Well Laid Out And Decorated  Almost A Replica Of Roman Baths Theme/Environment.,,,,,
,953,Senspa Has The Most Comprehensive Hydrotherapy Facilities I Have Ever Encountered (And I Have Visited A Fair Number Of Spas Over The Years) - They Were The Main Reason Why My Husband And I Drove 3 Hours For A Spa Weekend Away Even Though There Are Many Spa Hotels Closer To Where We Live.,,,,,
,954,No Huge Room To Improve. I Loved It  The Staff Were Brilliant,,,,,
,956,My Therapist For My Massage Was Excellent!  Unfortunately The Rhassoul Mud Treatment Didn't Work Properly But The Staff Were Quick To Apologise And Rectify The Situation,,,,,
,958,We Were In The Relaxation Area When A Group Of Load Women Came In And Totally Ruined The Experience You Should Put Big Signs Up Saying It Is A Quite Area   ,,,,,
,959,I Found That Staff Here Were Not As Friendly As Elsewhere In The Hotel.  I Had A Hot Stone Treatment And I Have Had Such Treatments Before.  I Felt Great Immediately Afterwards  But Unfortunately  I Was Then In A Lot Of Pain. Also  After Tipping The Young Lady  She Ran Out Of The Senspa Into The Hotel Area And Did Not Wait For Me To Leave.  I Felt That This Was Rather Rude.,,,,,
,960,I Have Mentioned My Issue In A Previous Comment. 

Overall  The Therapists And Receptionists Were Great.,,,,,
,968,Very Nice Facilities  But It Was Just The Issue That I Mentioned Earlier Whilst Having A Massage.,,,,,
,969,N/A,,,,,
,970,Men's Magazines Please And Cold Water Available In The Hydrotherapy Room Would Make It Perfect,,,,,
,974,I Booked An Overnight Spa Package And On Arrival At The Spa We Were Given Towels And Robes And Pointed In The Direction Of The Swimming Pool. I Had To Go Back And Ask If We Could Have The Access Bands To The Spa And When Doing So I Was Handed An Envelope With All My Details And Bands In. The Lady Who Gave Me The Envelope Was Helpful However I Should Have Had That On Arrival,,,,,
,975,Was Unable To Book Any Treatments As Too Busy- Perhaps Need More Staff,,,,,
,976,Having Booked Treatments- No Information Was Given Prior To Booking About Not Being Able To Shower Afterwards Which Left Our Spa Experience Very Short And Limited.
Knowing This Information Prior We Either Would Have Not Paid £50 To Enter The Sen Spa Or Would Have Booked Our Treatments Later In The Day. This Was The Only Disappointing Thing From Our Whole Stay.,,,,,
,982,Loved The Thai Massage And File And Polish That I Had.  My Husband Had The Thai Massage Too And Equally Loved It.  Pool Good Although Get There Early As Mot Many Lounge Chairs.,,,,,
,983,The Zoning Is Confusing To Hotel Quests  Perhaps Use Different Colour Carpet/Wall Paint. Inability Of Hotel Guests To Use Upper "Heat Rooms" And "Sitting Rooms" Is Anoying. ,,,,,
,984,Although I Enjoyed My Massage And Found It Relaxing  It Wasn't The Best I've Had. I'm A Therapist Myself So Always Have My 'Work' Head On When I Have A Treatment. Bit Disappointed That The Room Seemed To Smell Of Paint Or Other Strong Odour When The Rest Of The Hotel Smelt So Beautifully Of Citrus.,,,,,
,985,See Earlier Comment.,,,,,
,987,Overall Fantastic. Manager And All Staff Extremely Helpful. See Prev Remarks. 
Could Use Air Com In Silent Room Off Relaxation Room! ,,,,,
,989,My Husband Is Cross As I Have Come Home Demanding A Shower With Sea Storm Capabilities! I Felt Like A Cold At Christmas With All The Different Things To Do. Everything Was Spotlessly Clean. ,,,,,
,993,Thai Massage Therapists Were Excellent,,,,,
,995,Spa Was Booked Out So We Couldn't Have Any Treatments. Very Disappointing ,,,,,
,1000,Best Facial I Have Ever Had. ,,,,,
,1005,Footwear That Fits Would Be Helpful  That Someone Has Not Worn Before. Would Not Like To Get Verrucas Or Other Foot Infection,,,,,
,1008,A Truly Relaxing Massage And Lovely Pool. Could Do With Little Plastic Bags In Changing Room For Wet Swimming Costumes.,,,,,
,1009,The Massage Was The Best  Wonderful.,,,,,
,1014,The Drinking Water Stations In The Spa And Swimming Areas The Water Could Be Colder.,,,,,
,1015,They Were Very Well Organised,,,,,
,1021,A Larger Outside Area To Relax Between And After Treatments Would Be Appreciated,,,,,
,1032,The Swimming Pool Area Was Untidy With Used Towels Left On Most Of The Chairs So It Was Difficult To Find Somewhere To Sit.  There Was No Attendant In The Pool Area .,,,,,
,1033,I Had 3 Treatments Over The 3 Days. The First Massage Upon Arrival Was Wonderful But The Facial Wasn't As Good As I Usually Expect. My Skin Felt Very Tight & Dry After The Treatment.
My 3Rd Treatment (Anti-Stress Massage) Was The Most Uncomfortable One I've Ever Experienced. Whilst I Agreed To The Pressure That Was Being Used  I Found The Technique Unprofessional & Felt More Stressed After It. I Stated I'd Like More Work On My Neck & Shoulders But More Attention Was Paid To My Lower Back & Arms. I Was Expecting To Feel Sleepy & Relaxed Afterwards (Was Looking Frwrd To A Relaxing Sleep) But I Felt More Uptight Than Anything Else.
In Hindsight  I Should Have Complained At The Time But I Just Wanted It To Finish So I Could Leave  Unfortunately.,,,,,
,1035,The Changing Rooms Need Updating. Not Cleaned Regularly Enough In Late Afternoon ,,,,,
,1038,Loungers Limited Around The Pool So Access To Outside Seating Areas Other Than The Zen Garden Would Be Lovely  Particularly In The Hot Weather.,,,,,
,1039,We Always Find The Spa Staff Very Friendly And Helpful  And The Facilities Lived Up To Our Expectations. ,,,,,
,1046,Absolutely Bliss!! ,,,,,
,1049,The Sen Spa Was Perfect   And As I Said Before Made All The More Fantastic Due To Carmen On The Spa Reception   What An Asset To Your Hotel She Is 5********,,,,,
,1053,Excellent Range Of Facilities In The Hydrotherapy.  Well Worth The Extra Money.,,,,,
,1055,Ensure Periodic Visits Take Place  The Facilities Are Great  But Let Down By The "Steam Room Nasal Experience" !! ;-),,,,,
,1056,My Himalayan Treatment Was Exceptional,,,,,
,1062,No,,,,,
,1064,Too Expensive For Hotel Guests; The Basic Spa Facilities Should Be Included For Hotel Guests,,,,,
,1066,My Wife Had The Treatments And She Said They Were Very Good.,,,,,
,1071,£35 Per Day To Upgrade To Hydrotherapy Suite Is Too Much,,,,,
,1072,. It Was Very Cold When You Went To The Changing Rooms  So A Little Warmer Would Be Nice,,,,,
,1074,The Basket That Contains All The Wet Towels In The Ladies Needs A Clean - Huge Amounts Of Dust Between The Wicker - Probably Due To Air Conditioning. Absolutely Love The Facilities & The Staff Are Very Professional Yet Personable. ,,,,,
,1075,Love It!,,,,,
,1076,Very Busy On Saturday Pm - Sunbeds Had Towels On Them But No People!!!!! ,,,,,
,1078,Just The Best Part Of The Hotel.  Need To Sort Out The Bedding Arrangements  Too Mint People Dumped Towels On A Bed And Then Went Off For Treatments.  Not A Bid Issue With Nice Weather  But In Poor Weather It Will Be A Problem. ,,,,,
,1081,It Was Great To Be Back At Senspa And We Had A Really Lovely  Relaxing Time.  It Was Not Too Busy And The Facilities Were As Good As Ever.  I Love The Warmth Of The Hydrotherapy Pool And The Warm Beds In The Tepidarium.  The Swimming Pool Is Refreshing And I Enjoyed Swimming In It On My Own Several Times - Always A Treat To Be The Only Person In The Pool!!  I Like The Idea Of Tea Being On Offer In The Relaxation Room But Would Have Liked A Few Herbal Teas Too Or Some Labels As I Wasn't Sure What Sort Of Tea Bags They Were.  Also I Seem To Remember There Was A Wider Selection Of Magazines In The Relaxation Room On Previous Visits  Including Vogue  But I Enjoyed The Ones I Read.,,,,,
,1082,Unforgettable As Ever,,,,,
,1083,Despite There Being Signed That Guests Should Not Reserve Loungers By The Pool They Often Were By Towels/Robes Being Placed On Them  On A Number Of Occasions We Had To Remove Them.  I Think The Staff Should Periodically Check The Loungers And Remove Any Items From Them.,,,,,
,1085,The Mini Relaxation Treatment Was 20 Mins And It Felt Very Short And Was Very Painful - I Had To Leave The Room Immediately Which Was Not Relaxing At All. As My Husband Had Booked It For Me I Didn't Realise That It Was 20 Mins So It Felt Very Rushed And I Was Sorry That I Had Done It. ,,,,,
,1089,Fantastic Massage,,,,,
,1095,We Had Full Body Massage And Pedicures.  My Daughter Felt That Compared To The Attention I Received Hers Was Not So Good (Pedicure). We Sat Together So She Saw Procedures That I Underwent That She Didn't. ,,,,,
,1100,We Used The Swimming Pool And Sauna (The Steam Room Was Out Of Action). Our Only Issue With The Pool Area Was The Shortage Of Chairs/ Beds And How Close To The Pool They Were. It Really Needs More Space Around The Pool So That People Can Walk Around Without Brushing Past The Chairs.,,,,,
,1103,It Was Very Noisy And Too Busy On Our Second Day,,,,,
,1106,Was Not Aware That The Hydrotherapy Facilities Were Complimentary,,,,,
,1115,The Spa Is Always Very Enjoyable  However The Experience Showers Are Starting To Deteriorate.  Whichever Shower Was Selected  The Water Temperature Fluctuated - A Warm Tropical Shower Often Ended With A Cold Blast On The Head! One Of The Buttons Did Not Work At All.,,,,,
,1116,Water Was A Little Chilly In The Swimming Pool!!,,,,,
,1118,It Would Have Been Useful To Have More Literature Regarding The Benefits Of Some Of The Less Common Features In The Hydrotherapy- Like The Tepidarium. 

Also  The Regular Steam Room And The Mud Treatments Were Both Out Of Service.

Finally  More Male Magazines Everywhere!,,,,,
,1119,Steph Was Amazing And Gorgeous,,,,,
,1120,We Were Upgraded To To The Hydrotherapy Facilities  As The 'Ordinary' Steam Room Was Undergoing Maintenance. I Have To Say That I'm Extremely Glad We Were And Has Probably Been The Defining Thing That Will Encourage Us To Return Again And Book The Hydrotherapy.,,,,,
,1123,We Really Enjoyed The Child Free Environment! ,,,,,
,1125,It Was A Shame There Was No Herbal Tea Available In The Spa,,,,,
,1127,Hydrotherapy Was Very  Very Good. ,,,,,
,1131,We Found The Senspa Reception Staff Unprofessional And A Little Rude Upon First Arrival.  No One Offered To Help Us Despite Obviously Looking A Little Lost And Unsure Of Where To Go.  When We Did Ask How To Get To The Spa Area  We Weren't Told We Needed A Wrist Band  So Upon Arrival At The Spa Door  Realised We Couldn't Enter.  When We Went Back To The Reception  Two Of The Reception Girls 'Had The Fits Of Giggles' And Didn't Seem To Be Able To Speak To Us.  This We Found Incredibly Rude And Unprofessional And Did Not Give Us A Good First Impression Of What Turned Out To Be A Nice Spa.,,,,,
,1137,General Area Looking A Bit Tired.,,,,,
,1138,The Pool Was Very Busy With What Seemed To Be Groups Of People.  The Steam Room (Our Favourite Place) Was Not Working,,,,,
,1144,The Staff Were Very Busy Chatting To Each Other,,,,,
,1147,I Have Mentioned This Previously.,,,,,
,1152,Quite Expensive,,,,,
,1154,No Discounts Available For Longer Stayers ( 4 Nights Or More). Stairs In Hydrotherapy Area Very Slippery. ,,,,,
,1156,Great Facilities - Kept In Exceptional Condition As Always,,,,,
,1157,Despite Being Advised That A Member Of Staff Would Show My Wife Around To Introduce Her To The Different Facilities  She Was Simply Given A Card And Left To Her Own Devices.  This Meant That She Had To Work Out From Watching Others  How To Activate For Example  The Bubble Machines.  There Was A General Lack Of Staff  No Aromatic Ambience (Although Interestingly  This Was Done In The Main Hotel Reception Area) And Other Generally Awful Levels Of Presentation Eg Handwritten Address Labels On Bottles Of Handwash And Shower Gel.,,,,,
,1159,This Is The Main Reason We Return To Your Hotel.,,,,,
,1167,The Swimming Pool Surround Was Rather Small To Accommodate The Beds Hence There Were Not Enough Beds For Everyone.  Sitting On A Chair Isn't Quite So Relaxing.,,,,,
,1169,Fantastic,,,,,
,1174,I Was Disappointed That Herbal Teas Were Not Available In The Rest Rooms With The Ordinary Tea.,,,,,
,1176,Unfortunately There Was Debris Leftover From Other Guests' Visits That Was On Both Tables And The Floor  A Regular Visual Sweep Would Easily Spot. This  Plus  As With Most Spas  Insufficient Relaxing Chairs. ,,,,,
,1189,Disappointed With Service And Did Not Get To Enjoy Relaxation After The Massage,,,,,
,1190,Da The Spa Therapist Was Fantastic It Was The Best Massage I've Ever Received.,,,,,
,1195,No,,,,,
,1199,As A New Person To The Spa  There Was No Induction Or Explanation Of What Was In The Senspa Or How To Use It. Although The Areas Were Good  I Was Not Sure What They All Were Or How To Get The Best From Them  This Was The Only Area Lacking During Our Stay.,,,,,
,1200,The Reception Could Be Alittle More Organised,,,,,
,1204,Too Many People,,,,,
,1205,Very Relaxing And Enjoyable.  My Wife Had A Thai Massage Which She Confirmed Was Extremely Good.,,,,,
,1212,Could Not Fault The Service Or The Facilities.,,,,,
,1213,A World Class Spa That We Were Blown Away By. ,,,,,
,1224,Disappointed The Price Of Treatments Didn't Include Access To The Spa Facilities Or At Least A Discounted Rate On This Experience.,,,,,

,1,I Cannot Remember His Name Unfortunately But The Manager Of Le Blaireau Was Excellent.,,,,,
,3,The Bar Manager Was Heard Being Rude To Guests About Where To Spend Their Food Allowance.,,,,,
,4,Both The Girls On Reception Were Extremely Helpful And Polite  Sorry Do Not Remember Their Names  But When Checking In On Sunday Evening And When We Left Late On Monday Morning They Were Just Lovely.,,,,,
,5,Obviously The Zen Garden Member Off Staff Does Not Fall Into Above  Everyone Else Was To The Standard I Would Expect Of A 5Star Hotel.,,,,,
,9,Onsri - Exceptional Massage (And I'm A Connoisseur!),,,,,
,12,Ruben Handled Our Baggage For Us And We Passed Him Several Times In The Corridor. Each Time He Was Exceptionally Polite And Courteous And Was So With A Charming Smile.   Nora Did Our Checkout And Was Also Extremely Friendly And Helpful - A Very Good Last Impression Of The Hotel.   I Would Praise Them Both For Having Delivered Exceptional Customer Service And Would Say They Are Both Valuable Assets To Your Team.,,,,,
,13,The Bar Staff Were Great.,,,,,
,14,Didn't Know Names Sorry!,,,,,
,16, They Were All Lovely In The Spa.,,,,,
,27,The Woman On The Front Desk Who Heard That It Was My Husband's Birthday And Sent Up A Box Of Chocolates. Very Attentive And Thoughtful,,,,,
,32,Nuun And Lucy In The Senspa Were Both Very Informative. Nuun Suggested I Change One Of My Appointments And Benefit From Supplementing An Extra Back Massage Which Lucy Carried Out The Next Morning Along Side A Very Nice Exfoliation.A Big "Well Done" To The Management For Employing The Right People. Sean Was Incredibly Polite And Patient With His Two Big Girls Who Got In A Bit Of A Pickle With The Tai Chi And Yoga Class-But We Did Enjoy It And Would Definately Do It When We Come Back.,,,,,
,36,Our Waitress  Attentive  Professional And Lovely Personality ,,,,,
,43,Very Difficult To Pick Out Any Individual Above The Others. They All Deserve Commendation.,,,,,

,73,Everyone Was Fanastic To Me  Including The Workman Changing A Lightbulb Outside!,,,,,
,84,Morn - Very Friendly And Enjoyed Her Treatment,,,,,
,90,Reception Staff And Bell Boys Were Excellent. Attention Regarding Drinks In The Lounge Area Was Less That Expected  And Attention Both At Dinner In Le Bleaireau And At Breakfast Was Below Expectation. Survey Language Also Sets Expectations Very High So Its Hard To Strongly Agree With A Superlative Experience Unless It Truely Is Out Of This World,,,,,
,92,Excellent.,,,,,
,95,Heather In Reservations - She Gave Me Great Advice. Ray The Concierge On Arrival Because He Took Extra Time To Help Us. Nora And Emma On Reception Recommended Some Good Walks.   Charlotte On Front Desk Took Extra Time To Adjust My Bill  So I Could Claim Back Some Elements Of My Stay Through A Work Incentive Scheme.,,,,,
,96,Can't Remember Her Name  But The Older Lady Serving At The Tables In The Manor Restaurant (Anna?) - She Is Warm  Friendly And Very Down To Earth But Makes You Feel Special.   Also A Mention To The Reception Staff  All Of Whom Start (And End) The Stay On A Positive Note,,,,,

,104,Manager In Restaurant  Bar Staff In Manor Bar And Receptionist. Polite Attention,,,,,
,105,Your Concierge  Lewis,,,,,

,109,No All Excellent,,,,,
,111,Ruben Was Very Pleasant And Helpful  But Everyone Had The Same Attitude Towards The Guests,,,,,

,140,Thomas And His Assistant Managers Were Fantastic. If Your Staff Wore Name Badges It Would Be Easier To Single Out Those Who Were Our Main Contacts But On The Other Hand Everyone We Spoke To Was Fantastic From The Spa To The Restaurant To The Bar And Reception And The Room Maids.,,,,,
,143,No,,,,,
,147,Every Single One Of The Staff  Who Served Us Throughout Our Stay.,,,,,
,149,All Of The Staff Were Wonderful,,,,,

,153,The Member Of Staff Who Lent My Husband A Tux For The Black Tie! Wonderful. The Thai Guy In The Thai Restaurant Who Served Us And The Nourishing Attentions Of The Masseuse.,,,,,
,154,As We Did Not Get Many Staff Names It's Hard To Comment Specifcally But Everyone Was Very Good  Particularly The Waiting Staff In The Manor Restaurant  The Reception Staff And The Concierge.,,,,,
,156,Dawn Brand Because She Goes Out Of Her Way To Ensure My Stay Is Perfect Every Time.,,,,,
,159,It Has To Be Matte (Don't Know If That's How You Spell His Name) In The Manor Restaurant.   He Looked After Us Completely  Was A True Gentleman At All Times And We Can't Praise Him Enough.   He Remembers Our Choices  Even To The Point Of Making Sure I Had Gluten Free Products Where There Was An Alternative At All Times  Without Me Having To Ask.   He Remembered What Drinks We Liked  And  Well Just About Everything.   Goodness Only Knows How He Does It  But He Is A Total Credit To The Hotel  And I Do So Hope He Stays With You For A Long Time :-) .,,,,,
,176,All Staff Were Very Friendly. ..  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. .. Therapist's Excellent. ..  Would Mention Atom Because I Enjoyed Her Treatment The Most. ...And So Friendly And Easy To Talk To...,,,,,
,180,In General It Would Be Unfair To Single Out One Individual As All Your Staff Were Of The Highest Standard. We Did Notice That They Were From All Parts Of Europe And Interacted Well With The Clients.,,,,,

,184,No,,,,,

,282,All Members Of Your Team Were Without Fault. .,,,,,

I Can't Recall The Name Of The Very Helpful Girl Who Was At The Spa Reception Most Of The Time. I Did Get Her Name And Used It In The Comment Form At The Spa. However Plenty Of Other Staff Were Totally Helpful. The Only Other A Bit Short With Me Was The (I'm Presuming Thai Male Manager In Zen Garden) When I Pointed Out There Was Almost Nothing To Drink In The Relaxation Room Having Had To Hobble Down To Ask. Not Designed To Make You Feel "Relaxed" ! He Did Organise Some Green Tea Relatively Quickly But Was Far From Gracious About It.,,,,,

,779,I Am Not Sure Of Her Name But The Lady Who Carried Out The Check Out Couldn't Have Been More Pleasant. I Think She Was In Training. Also The Chap Offering To Take Bags Out For Us Was Very Welcoming And Friendly.,,,,,
,784,The Gent In The Foyer Was Very Knowledgeable And Helpful.
I Thought That He Was The Hotel Owner!!!,,,,,
,788,Reuben And Fernando From The Manor Restaurant Made Us Feel Special And The Receptionist From The

I Would Come Back To The Hotel On The Strength Of The Staff Alone.  We Did Have A Problem At Breakfast When I Asked For Two Soft Boiled Eggs And The Lady Taking The Order Didn't Understand  But She Got Help And Although I Ended Up With Two Hard Boiled Eggs It Didn't Really Matter As We Had Service With A Smile!,,,,,
,827,All Where As Good As Each Other...,,,,,
,828,Staff On Reception Were A Little Hit And Miss.  Had To Ask 3 Times For A Tooth Brush - Eventually One Arrived Although Disappointed That I Had To Keep Asking From Before Breakfast To Evening!  Hate It When I'm Mid Conversation And Am Interupted By The Receptionist Rushing Off To Answer The Phone.  Plastic Key Card Stopped Working And Did Not Like The Receptionist Questioning As To Why It Had Stopped Working.  It Was In My Bag......!

I Think She May Have Been Scandinavian Or German And Wore Glasses. They Were Both Fantastic Hosts,,,,,
,978,Except In Manor Restr,,,,,
,981,The Male Who Greeted Us Was So Professional And Could Not Do Enough For Us  For All Of Our Stay  A True Gentleman!,,,,,
,982,Man In Charge At Breakfast In The Dining Room  He Was On The Ball.,,,,,
,983,Luggage Assitance On Arrival (Retired Gent) Was Very Helpfull,,,,,
,985,Samczec! (The Tall Polish Chap)

Reason: I Was Staying With My Girlfriend And We Both Commented To One Another How Friendly And Polite He Was. He Even Smiled Politely When I Ranted At Him About The Polish Pilots Flying For The Raf In The Battle Of Britain During World War Ii. Anyone Deserves A Medal For That To Be Fair.,,,,,
,987,Previous Remarks. Also Lady Who Did My Pregnsncy Massage Is Fantastic At Her Job! Sorry I Can't Remember Names. She Has A Little Girl Who Is 8. ,,,,,
,988,Zen Staff,,,,,
,989,Ray For Bag Carrying And Planting The Seed That We Could Do This As An Anniversary Style Thing Every Year....We Shall Be Back! Steph For My Massage  She Asked How I Wanted It And Was Spot On. Mike At Reception For The Upgrade. Joel For Catching Us Before We Wandered Into The Kitchen.,,,,,
,993,The Massage Therapists - Don't Know Their Names As The Massages Were So Good  Also The French Porter Who Brought Our Cases From The Car Without Us There. ,,,,,
,994,Not Really  We Found That The Staff In General Did Not Acknowledge Us When We Were Coming And Going. Not As Friendly As Our Last Visit. It Did Not Affect Our Stay.,,,,,
,997,Jim  The Manager Of Le Blaireau And Colin Looked After Us Extremely Well  Thank You!,,,,,
,999,The Indian Gentleman Who We Believe Was The Assistant Manager  Who Started Working In The Hotel Two Weeks Ago. His Presentation Was Excellent  His Communication Skills Were Excellent In As Much As He Listened To What We Had To Say  In Fact We Would Say He Epitomises The Essence Of All That Is The Very Highest Standards Of English Hotels. He Is A Credit To Your Organisation.,,,,,
,1006,The Staff In The Thai Restaurant Were Excellent As Were The Ladies Who Did The Treatments For My Wife And I ,,,,,
,1010,Steph  Who Gave My Wife A Hot Stone Massage  She Was Very Attentive And Knowledgeable On The Products Required For Future Use.,,,,,
,1011,All Were Good.,,,,,
,1014,All Maintained A High Standard At All Times And The Rooms Were Kept Very Clean,,,,,
,1015,The Manager Who Dealt With The Problem I Experienced 19/07/14 Pm,,,,,

,,,,,
,1020,No.,,,,,
,1021,The Porter Who Helped Us To Our Room ,,,,,
,1024,Absolutely Brilliant Service Great Staff,,,,,
,1031,I Neglected To Ask Their Names  But Everyone Involved In Dinner And Breakfast Was Charm And Skill (Particularly In The Case Of The Chefs) Personified. You Definitely Recruit For The Right Qualities  And The Euro Centric Bias Is An Excellent Touch!,,,,,
,1036,Two Young Men (Cant Remember Their Names),,,,,
,1038,Everyone We Came Across Was Lovely And Helpful - Thank You,,,,,
,1039,The Young Man Who Greeted Us Upon Our Arrival And Parked Our Car. He Was Extremely Polite And Professional And We Were Very Impressed By How Prompt And Efficient He Was In Handling Our Requests. ,,,,,
,1041,Anna In The Restaurant Was Always A Delight To Chat To In The Evenings Whilst She Looked After Us.,,,,,
,1043,I Don't Know The Name  But The Lady Who Came Out Of The Laundry And Offered The Help Of The Laundry Porter (As He Knew About Cars) When I Was Changing My Wheel Outside The Laundry Area - Thursday 24Th July.  I Didn't Need The Help But It Was Great Service To Come Out An Offer Assistance As She Clearly Saw Me Out Of The Open Laundry Doors.  This Type Of Attitude Shows That All The Hotel Staff Care About The Customer Even When They Don't Always Get The Opportunity To Show It Directly.,,,,,
,1046,They Were All Outstanding ,,,,,
,1051,To Many To Name The Staff Went To A Lot Of Trouble To Remember My Name And Room Number And The Table We Liked In The Manor ,,,,,
,1052,You Have Excellent Staff. They Are All Professional  And Attentive.  The Young Man Who Greeted Us In The Car Park In Front Of The Manor Overwhelmed My Father And I With His Pleasant Manner. I Felt Your Reception Staff Were Very Good  And The As Mentioned Before  Juan Was Excellent. He Spoke So Nicely To My Father  Who Engaged Him In A Little Small Talk. I Felt That He Went That Extra Mile For Us  And It Just Makes The Difference. ,,,,,
,1053,Ray  As He Was Friendly And Helpful Without Being Intrusive.
However  All Staff Were Excellent  But Cannot Remember Their Names.,,,,,
,1054,Peter - As Previously Mentioned,,,,,
,1055,No  Really Let Down By The Dining Experience,,,,,
,1056,I Would Like To Say That All The People Who Gave Us Our Treatments Were Really Very Good All Round,,,,,
,1057,Waiting Staff All Exceptionally Friendly And Reception. Shame About The One Member Of Bar Staff.,,,,,
,1058,The Bar Staff Were Very Poor  However The Reception Staff Were Friendly And Helpful. ,,,,,
,1062,The Duty Manager On The Evening Who After We Complained Ensured We Had Dessert In The Main Restaurant  Recommended A Dessert Wine To Accompany And Tried Everything To Compensate Our Bad Experience In The French Bistro - He Was On Duty At Breakfast Wednesday Morning And Again Went Out Of His Way To Ensure Everything Ok,,,,,
,1064,Don't Know Names But The Concierge Guys Were Excellent As Was The Manager Who Was Around Reception When We Arrived,,,,,
,1065,Conceige Saw We Were Carrying Birthday Cards To Breakfast On 24Th  Next Minute Champagne Arrived At Table. Lovely Touch.,,,,,
,1066,It Wouldn't Be Right To Single Out Any Member Of Staff As They Were All Great. It Was Nice The Bar Man On The First Night Liked Rum Like Myself So Was Nice To Have A Chat. ,,,,,
,1067,Everyone Was Very Friendly  There Was Nobody In Particular.,,,,,
,1068,French Girl At Reception With Dark Hair - Helped To Get Numbers For Local Doctors When I Wasn't Feeling Well,,,,,
,1071,James And Richard In Bleireaus Were Excellent. Friendly Atmosphere. ,,,,,
,1072, I Have A Terrible Memory And Cannot Remember The Girls Names Who I Had Treatment With. However They Did Make Me Feel At Home And Comfortable And They Both Looked After Me Very Well . Thankyou :) X,,,,,
,1073,The Girl Who Cleaned Our Rooms. They Were Spotless.  Also The Headwaiters In The Blaireau Restaurant,,,,,
,1075,The Therapists Who Did My Massage And Pedicure This Time.  Can't Remember Their Names.,,,,,
,1078,No One Was Outstanding.  Not Impressed With A Member Of The Bar Staff Bring The Spa Cuddling His Girlfriend All Afternoon. ,,,,,
,1081,The Lady In The Spa Shop Was Friendly And Helpful  And We Found The Staff At The Zen Garden Particularly Polite And Attentive.  Hotel Reception Staff Were Very Helpful Both Before The Stay And When We Checked In/Checked Out  For Example The Lady Who Helped Me On Friday Afternoon Regarding Bicycle Hire.   ,,,,,
,1082,There Was A Young Man That Helped Me With My Bags And Showed Me To And Around My Room  I Forget His Name But He Was Very Helpful.,,,,,
,1083,All Restaurant Staff Were Fantastic.,,,,,
,1084,Roy Was Excellent.....Very Welcoming,,,,,
,1085,Everyone Was Lovely But The Lady Who Gave Me My Second Treatment Was Not As Friendly And It Made A Big Difference,,,,,
,1096,All The Team Were Great! ,,,,,
,1097,Reception Staff  Very Helpful,,,,,
,1098,Leo At The Front Desk Was Very Helpful And Insightful
Staff At The Zen Garden Were Very Polite And Attentive Even While Resturant Was Full,,,,,
,1099,Jim  Phil And The Chef At Le Blaireau  Who Made Our Visit Particularly Memorable.,,,,,
,1100,Peter Gave A Great Introduction And Was Very Helpful. There Was Another Young Chap Who Was Often Around The Reception Area And Fixed A Light Bulb For Us Who Was Very Friendly And Helpful Also.,,,,,
,1107,Please Refer To My Earliest Comment With Regard To Sophie - Shining Star For Your Establishment,,,,,
,1109,All Staff Were Welcoming,,,,,
,1114,It Would Be Wrong To Pick Anyone Out Specifically - All Staff Were Excellent,,,,,
,1115,All The Staff I Encountered Were Lovely.,,,,,
,1116,Everyone We Met Was Lovely,,,,,
,1117,Think It Was Paul - Older Gentleman Who Greeted Us When We Arrived And Then Did A Mini Tour For Us. Also The Waitress From Spain That Served Us On The Second Night (Sat Night) In The Manor Restaurant Was Very Friendly.,,,,,
,1119,Steph In The Spa  Amazing Hands,,,,,

,1154,Head Of Concierge  Concierge (French Speaking) And Lady In Spa Reception Were Very Helpful. Head Of Concierge Was Exceptional Paying Particular Attention To Customer Satisfaction. ,,,,,
,1155,We'd Like To Thank Suzy And Colin Who Sorted Out Parking For My Husband's Car And Also Dawn Who Made Sure To Double Check This When We Booked.  Also Louis  Who Looked After Us When We Arrived And Swapped Our Parking Away From The Wedding Which Was Getting A Bit Roudy.,,,,,
,1156,The Gentleman On Arrival - I Cannot Remember His Name But He Is From Ferndown (After A Conversation I Had With Him). He Was So Welcoming  Polite And Knowledgable. He Made Us Feel Excited About Our Stay And That We Were Valued Visitors To The Manor. Also A Young Man In The Manor Restaurant In The Evening  He Was Very Attentive And Chatty Which Was Really Nice And Refreshing Rather Than Just Bringing Us Food And Drink. ,,,,,
,1157,The Duty Assistant Manager Who Seemed To Be Mortified At Our Experience With The Bar Tenders  And The Only Person Who Seemed To Care About What He Was Actually Supposed To Be Doing Ie Accommodating Guests.,,,,,
,1159,I Made A Comment To The Duty Manager On Friday 8Th (Evening) Regarding A Young Man Working In The Bar Area  On His First Day! The Service  Attitude And Professionalism Was Outstanding. ,,,,,
,1163,Mixed Bag. Some Very Good  Otherwise Was Very Forced And Unnatural. ,,,,,
,1165,Breakfast Staff Quite Disorganised  Bar Staff Were Not Very Attentive / Courteous,,,,,
,1166,See Earlier Notes,,,,,
,1174,Leo Was Very Welcoming And My Beauty Therapist Was Very Experienced. ,,,,,
,1176,Phil In Le Blaireau Plus The Lady Receptionist Who Checked Us In  As A Female Couple She Was Very Discreet When Advising Of The Make Up Of The Room.  ,,,,,
,1178,All Very Good ,,,,,
,1179,All The Staff In The Zen Resturant
Manager Chap In A Suit ...Can't Remember His Name But Carried Our Bags To Reception Which I Thought Was A Nice Gesture.,,,,,
,1183,Michael And The Barman On Thursday 14Th,,,,,
,1190,Missed This Bit "Da" And Her Colleague Who We Had A Joint Massage With Were Both Fantastic,,,,,
,1194,Michael Did A Great Job Of Providing Me With A Tour Of The Facilities And Helping Out With A Couple Of Requests.,,,,,
,1195,Reception Porter - Most Helpful,,,,,
,1196,All Staff..........................,,,,,
,1199,The Staff In The French Restuarant They Made Sure We Had A Greaty Evening Without Styress.,,,,,
,1201,Most Of Them Were Very Helpful - Let Down By The Odd One,,,,,
,1202,The Porter On Arrival Was Very Helpful Indeed And The Assistant Manager When Dealing With Our Complaint,,,,,
,1203,Emily At Reception As She Was Efficient And Smiled And Extremely Knowledgeable About Your Hotel And Its Services. Also Peter Who Welcomed Us  On Arrival  Outside The Main Reception  And Ensured  When We Left That We Had Details Of How To Get Out Of The New Forrest For Our Return Journey Avoiding The Traffic Jams In Lyndhurst.,,,,,
,1205,I'm Afraid I Do Not Know The Names Of Any Of The People I Spoke To  However Everyone I Did Have Contact With  From Reception To The Bar To The Ladies In The Spa Were All Very Friendly  Knowledgeable And Attentive. I Would Extend Warm Thanks To All Of Them.,,,,,

,----------------------,,,,,,
,3,With Regards To Staff No. ,,,,,
,5,Zen Garden Should Have Been Better.,,,,,
,9,More Variety Of Lunch Options Available In The Spa. We Ate Thai Food Twice In One Day Which Whilst Delicious  It Didn't Then Feel As Special To Have The Evening Meal As Well ,,,,,
,13,Had Staff Reacted Differently To Our Disappointment Over The Hydrotherapy Suite Being Full (Not Sure How Exactly  But We Left Feeling Very Let Down) Better Breakfast,,,,,
,14,Not At All - I Am So Thrilled To Have Discovered Your Hotel!,,,,,
,16, Provide More Staff At Checkin/Checkout.We Waited Ages To Be Seen On Check Out And Because Of Our Problems With The Bill  We Caused A Long Que Of Other Hotel Guests Who Wanted To Be Seen.,,,,,
,17,Better Service In The Restaurant,,,,,
,24,You Need To Improve The Breakfast Experience As I Have Mentioned  Previously.,,,,,
,25,One Thing That Could Be Improved Upon  We Were Told That Our Spa Stay Included Refreshments During The Day But Not What Refreshments  Therefore I Was Never Sure Whether We Should Pay For A Drink Or If It Was Included  Ie. I Wasn't Charged For Orange Juice  But I Was Charged For A Smoothie.,,,,,
,30,Made Sure The Food Was Of A Reasonable Quality,,,,,
,32,No All Good,,,,,
,36,Better Puddings! ,,,,,
,39,Lots - Correct All The Things Just Mentioned. ,,,,,
,40,Better Shower In Room,,,,,
,41,Only The Little Complaint Regarding The Robes.  Also The Internet Access Seemed To Be Restricted To 2 Gadgets Per Room.  As We Both Had Our Iphones And Tablets It Was A Little Inconvenient.  But That Really Is Nitpicking!,,,,,
,43,Definitely Not.,,,,,
,49,This Was Our 4Th Visit To Careys Manor And Have Always Stayed At The Same Time Of Year As Its How We've Chosen To Celebrate Our Wedding Anniversary.  It Would Have Been Really Special If The Booking System Had A Facility To See These Patterns Or At Least Pick Out That You're A Returning Customer  And Acknowledge This Accordingly (Even If It's Just A "Welcome Back" Type Message).  Some Acknowledgelement Of Our Return Visits And Dedicated Custom (Although I Acknowledge That We Didn't Visit In The Past 2 Years As We Were Living Overseas) Would Make Us Feel Really Special!  Breakfast Was A Little Chaotic  We Struggled To Find Someone To Order Poached Eggs From And I Recall This Being The Same Situation From Prior Visits And It Wasn't A Big Issue For Us.,,,,,
,52,Make It More Obvious That The White Sen Spa Slippers Given Are Not Suitable For The Pool Side. I Did Nearly Slip And Fall And It Could Cause A Serious Accident If People Are Unaware The Slippers Are Not Suitable And Get Extremely Slippery When Used Around The Pool Side. I Accept There Is A Sign (Which I Noticed After The Incident) However  This Needs To Be More Focal And More Obvious To People.  ,,,,,
,53,Apparently Refreshments Were Included In The Price However When I Asked For Orange Juice Apparently It Has Finished  Same As Apple Juice  So I Was Given Cranberry Juice For Which I Was Charged At Checkout. Very Lame Approach To Customer Service. My Experience Was Defiantly Spoiled By That.,,,,,
,54,No,,,,,
,61,Improve  Common Areas  Apart From Old  Part With The Log Fire  Which Was Very Nice Need Inproving  Restuarnt Area  Was Not Special  Overall Poor Value For  Money Feel Like I Have Wasted  £400,,,,,
,66,I Was Disappointed To See Someone ( A Fellow Guest ) Talking On Their Mobile Whilst Walking Round The Pool ( Saturday 23Rd November 2013 ). I Think The Spa's " No Mobiles " Policy Is Great And Maybe A Gentle Reminder Of This For People Who Are " On The Mobile ". To Be Totally Fair  I'm Very Mindful If A Member Of The Team Doesn't See It Happening  Then Unless Someone Flags It There Isn't The Opportunity For The Team To Address It. ,,,,,
,67,The Deserts ,,,,,
,68,No,,,,,
,71,Captured A Rainbow And Had It Strategically Placed Over The Pool? :-) ,,,,,
,73,Beg Me Not To Leave,,,,,
,77,I Was Surprised At Breakfast By A Few Points And Actually Let The Hotel Down. We Arrived Around 9;40Am And Some Of The Food Was Cold And Of A Poor Quality. The Bacon And Sausages Were Not Of A Good Standard And I Had To Wait A While For Eggs To Put Out. I Also Found It Strange That You Had To Order Beans As A Special Item. I Have Visited Many Hotels And Felt Your Breakfast Experience Could Be Improved And The Layout To Enhance They Service.  A Disappointed End To The Stay. ,,,,,
,78,See Previous Comments Regarding Accuracy Of Bill.,,,,,
,79,Please Improve The Bill System.,,,,,
,84,Improve The Hotel Rooms To Make It A Really Luxurious Experience,,,,,
,88,More Modern Room,,,,,
,92,More Variety On Room Service Menu.,,,,,
,93,Only The Things That I Have Already Listed.  I Hope You Find My Comments Constructive - The Overall Experience Was Excellent!,,,,,
,95,A Few More Gluten Free Options Would Have Been Nice As I Mentioned My Gluten Intolerance When Booking.   The Tea Rooms In Lyndhurst Do Wonderful Gluten Free Cakes!,,,,,
,97,Having Stayed Before  We Knew What To Expect And You Delivered Although One Very Minor Niggle Was The Breakfast Experience Which Was Not As Good As Last Time But Was Still Very Good,,,,,
,104,Final Bill Was Rather Confusing As The £180.00 Dining Bill Was Not Shown And Our Guests Paid £50 Towards Drinks That Was Also Not Shown. A Bottle Of Wine Was Listed As £31.34 On The Bill That Was £23 + On The Menu. My Problem With This Is That I Had To Query Each Item And Was Given A Good Explanation So All Was Ok But It Should Be Itemised Correctly With The £80 Food Credit Also Shown.,,,,,
,105,See Earlier,,,,,
,106,Just My Earlier Comments.,,,,,
,109,See My  Previous Comments I Expect Nothing Will Happen Regarding My Comments But It Would Stop Us Coming Agsin Ross Wraight,,,,,
,113,We Were Ushered Away From The Lounge When Looking For A Pre Dinner Drink - I Believe There Was An Xmas Party Booked But No Explanation Was Given And The Bar Area Is A Bit Like Waiting For A Bus - So Not Quite The Same As My Previous Visit !,,,,,
,116,The Older Rooms Require Updating.,,,,,
,121,Nothing . Everything Was Perfect.,,,,,
,123,Knowing That There Were Christmas Revellers Partying Until Late  At Least Ask The Following Day On Departure Whether Everything Had Been Satisfactory.,,,,,
,129,The Spa And Hotel Could Have Been Cooler.,,,,,
,130,Maybe Some Festive Music To Create An Ambience.,,,,,
,132,No Excellent Every Time.,,,,,
,140,More Bananas ( Just Joking),,,,,
,143,No,,,,,
,147,No,,,,,
,148,No,,,,,
,152,Perhaps You Could Have Arranged For A New Forest Pony To Bring Me A Birthday Card?  Otherwise I Can't Think Of Anything - I Felt Like A Princess.  I Strongly Suspect This Is The General Opinion Of All Your Guests  My Partner Also Felt Very Spoilt And He Is Notoriously Hard To Please.  'The Breakfasts Were Amazing' - He Would Like Me To Pass This On.,,,,,
,154,Everything Had Been Thought About And Seemed To Show That Things Were Well Tried And Tested. So The Answer Is "No"!,,,,,
,159,Very Picky  But Maybe More Christmas Decorations Around The Public Rooms - The Decorations This Year Were Subdued And None In The Manor Restaurant.   Last Year It Was Much Better.   At Christmas Less Is Definitely Not More - At Christmas Its Got To Be Bright  Happy And Lots And Lots !  Make It Very Away There Is Only An Allowance At The Two Other Restaurants If Eating There - Only The Manor Is Totally Inclusive.,,,,,
,163,The Carols Last Year Were Lovely. They Did Not Happen This Year.,,,,,
,164,The Only Thing I Would Like To Comment On Is That  I Think That Some Of Your Ground Floor Rooms Need To Have Wetrooms Installed.  Even Though I Was Told I Would Be Shown The Spa Wetroom On Arrival  I Wasn't And My Husband Felt Unsafe.  You Really Need To Have A Grip Handle Near Shower  That People Can Hold Onto. There Is One At The Start And For The Bath  But Not The Shower,,,,,
,165,Our Every Need Was More Than Catered For And It Was A Memorable Visit.,,,,,
,167,Turndown Service Requested But Didn't Happen,,,,,
,171,Improve The Manor Restaurant.,,,,,
,174,Paid For It!!,,,,,
,176,We Were Having A Break From Our 3 Demanding Lovely Girls. .. We Wanted To Relax   Chill And Be Spoilt....Carey S Manor Gave Us That. .. To Be Absolutely Perfect Yes I Would Have Liked Better Sleep But Overall It Was Still Damn Good,,,,,
,182,Check Out Was Disappointing. Disconcerting To Find Room Keys No Longer Worked At 11.10Am! It Would Be Better If You Extended The Overlap Period As Even At 11.40 We Still Had To Wait / Queue To Check Out... ,,,,,
,184,No,,,,,
,185,We Did Find Your Reception A Bit Gloomy  And "Gothic" For Our Tastes.,,,,,
,186,No!,,,,,
,187,The Standard In The Hotel Is Very Good And If Kept Up Will Not Disappoint.,,,,,
,189,Nothing At All.,,,,,
,190,No,,,,,
,191,Arranged The Weather!,,,,,
,192,Improve The Taste And Choice Of The Included Menu  Don't Exclude Hotel Guests From The Hydrotherapy Area Of The Spa.,,,,,
,193,Not At All,,,,,
,203,None,,,,,
,207,Improve The Weather!,,,,,
,208,Only Relating To The Dance Floor Size,,,,,
,216,Is It Necessary To Have Piped Music At Meal Times. ,,,,,
,217,A Later Check Out Would Be Greatly Appreciated  ,,,,,
,221, All Very Good..!,,,,,
,222,No,,,,,
,225,No,,,,,
,226,Refer Comments Ref. Dining Experience - They Are Meant To Be Constructive ,,,,,
,233,Could Not Have Been Better,,,,,
,234,Can't Think Of Anything. ,,,,,
,236,No,,,,,
,242,Everything About Your Hotel And Spa Was Great Except For The Noisy Guests,,,,,
,244,We Had To Call A Few Times For Help When Leaving As The Desk Was Unmanned  Our Bags Were In The Storeroom And We Needed A Lift To The Station.,,,,,
,246,Updated General Hotel Facilities.  I Think The Website Maybe A Little Misleading.  A Cosy Manor Country Retreat This Is Not.  ,,,,,
,255,Provided Larger Slippers For Men!,,,,,
,256,The Short Route From The Room To The Spa Was Via The Cold Outdoors. The Long (Indoor Route) Was Easy To Get Wrong!! More Signs Maybe? ,,,,,
,262,More Bar Staff. Chap Serving Was Good But Not Even Close To Coping And On Sat Evening I Waited 20 Mins To Get Served. ,,,,,
,272,Breakfast Needs Enhancing  Quality Of Hot Food Was Mixed  Scrambled Egg Was Cold  Bacon Was Slimy And Under Cooked As Were The Sausages. Bread Choice Was Very Basic For A Hotel Of This Standard And The Pastry Selection Was Also Severely Depleted. Other Hotels Of Your Standard Have Really Upped Their Game For Breakfast In Terms Of Choice And Quality  You Would Do Well To Explore How You Can Offer A More Premium Breakfast Experience.,,,,,
,277,No,,,,,
,279,We Weren't Checking In Til 6 Pm And I Though It Was A Bit Of A Rip Off Trying To Charge Us £25 To Use The Hydro Spa For An Hour In The Eve When We'd Paid £35 To Upgrade To This Spa Package But That Was Just For The Day Of Our Checkout. This Kind Of Sharp Tactic When It Comes To Money Will Prob Mean I Come Again. ,,,,,
,282,No  This Was Our Forth Visit And This Visit Was The Same High Standard We Have Always Experienced,,,,,
,283,Probably Not On This Occasion.  ,,,,,
,285,No,,,,,
,290,Not Really,,,,,
,291,No Thank You,,,,,
,303,When You Pay Hotel Prices For A Bottle Of Lager  It Should Be Cold! I Fancied A Guinness But It Was Only In Cans - Not From A Pump As Indicated By The Pump On The Bar.,,,,,
,304,A Very Nice Stay But It Was Not Over The Top.,,,,,
,306,We Did Have To Wait Quite A While In The Breakfast Queue And Then We Had Another Long Wait For Eggs. When They Eventually Arrived We Had A Lack Of Cutlery On Our Table. We Just Felt The Breakfast Experience Could Have Been Better. We Did Love Our Stay Though And The Food At Dinner Was One Of The Best Meals We Have Both Had. We Are Not Put Off By The Breakfast Situation Though And Would Love To Come Back Again. We Would Definitely Recommend.
Thanks For A Lovely Stay,,,,,
,308,Spa Too Busy On Friday And Treatments.,,,,,
,318,It Would Have Been Great To Have Some Walking Maps We Could Have Or Borrow So We Could Pick A Short Or A Longer Walk Into The Forest  Knowing Exactly Where We Were Going And How Long To Leave For It.,,,,,
,320,No!,,,,,
,324,Move The Breakfast Area So It Is Not By The Door And Reduce The Queue,,,,,
,326,I Think We Should Have Dined In The Thai Restaurant As We Have Had Excellent Meals In There Previously.,,,,,
,327,I Think The Setting  Spa And Dining Were Of A High Standard. Let Down Only By A Few Minor Things Which Tarnished The Overall Impression. ,,,,,
,331,More Polite Staff In The Bar Area  Better Quality Breakfast Not Just Keeped Warm By Steam.. And Price's To Be Looked At..,,,,,
,332,More Choice On Menu At The Manor Restaurant And Refreshments In The Sen Spa Need To Be Regally Checked  ,,,,,
,333,Environment Lovely Just A Shame So Busy Saturday. If Bookings Correct Would Of Been Great As Meal Was Amazing In Resturant. I Want To Redo Weekend And Next Time Have Treatments At Times I Request Hoefully. ,,,,,
,334, Overall A Lovely Stay Except An Upset Stomach And A Few Minor Glitches. 
,,,,,
,336,We Just Wish We Had Stayed Longer!,,,,,
,340,Comments Made Earlier Regarding Decor And Spa Treatment,,,,,
,344,I Very Much Doubt It; It Was A Fabulous Stay And It Was Sad It Had To End.,,,,,
,350,Fridge In Room.,,,,,
,357,Nothing Other Than My Previous Comments. ,,,,,
,363,Please See Previous Comments - Very Disappointed In Our Stay,,,,,
,364,If The Room Had Been As Expected  Then I Think That Would Have Topped Off Our Experience - £258.00 For A Saturday Night Is Very Expensive  Then Only £179.00 For Sun & Mon But With No Enhancements For The Extra £79.00 That Is Charged For A Saturday.. I Know It's Because It's A Premium Night  But Goodness There Has To Be Some Other Reason That It's A Saturday!,,,,,
,366,No,,,,,
,368,No -It Was Great!,,,,,
,369,I Couldn't Find Fault With Anything,,,,,
,373,Nothing Really,,,,,
,378,The Bar Area Was Full Of Kids One Night Which Was Not Very Pleasant To Enjoy A Cocktail  The Gin & Tonic Of £11.60 Was Basic For The Price!
You Could Also Have A Better Bread Selection At Breakfast..,,,,,
,382,Would Have Liked To Have Been Told Or Given A Breakfast Menu On The First Morning  Buffet Eggs And Bacon Were Stone Cold As Were The Hash Browns But No One Told Us We Could Order Them.  I Did Not Use The Buffet The Next Day But Ordered Instead As A Menu Was On Our Table.,,,,,
,383,I Don't Think So  Just Keep Up Your Really High Standards.,,,,,
,385,A Served Breakfast As Opposed To A Buffet.,,,,,
,389,Dearer Than The Christchurch Bay Hotel Mudyford,,,,,
,392,None - A Excellent Experience From The Champagne Making Us Feel Valued And Welcome To The Delicious Meal And The Relaxing Spa Facilities And Treatments.  ,,,,,
,393,More Detailed Description Of Rooms On Website And Perhaps A Mini-Bar In The Room,,,,,
,396,We Felt That The Spa Experience Would Have Benefited From A Less Formal Lunch Time Eating Area With A More Varied Light Refreshment Menu.,,,,,
,398,Check Out Was The Only Part I Was Disappointed With. There Was A Large Queue With People Waiting With Luggage  To Check Both In And Out  And There Was Only One Person On Reception. Although  Like All The Other Staff  He Was Trying His Best And Very Polite  I Didn't Think That At A Hotel Like This  One Would Encounter Such A Problem. My Bill Was Also Incorrect At The Final Account. ,,,,,
,410,Nothing,,,,,
,412,No Thank You,,,,,
,413,Can't Think Of Anything.,,,,,
,414,We Both Lost Our Way Finding 058  That's All!,,,,,
,417,Spa Towels Were Not Absorbent At All! Would Have Expected Higher Quality At Prices Paid. Decor A Bit Worn Especially Outside Spa,,,,,
,418,Fried Eggs At Breakfast Were Over Cooked Due To Being On The Warmer Too Long,,,,,
,420,Sort Out The Breakfast Team.,,,,,
,430,Checkout - Bill Was Not Accurate With 10% Spa Treatment Discounts.  This Should Have Been Dealt With Before And All Paperwork Printed In Advance To Make This Process Quicker.,,,,,
,431,Devise A Package That Would Also Include Dinner. We Had The Winter Detox Deal And Perhaps For A Bit More Money It Could Include A Dinner Supplement.,,,,,
,433,Only To Insist We Stay Longer!,,,,,
,455,Made It Clear There Would Be Limited Dinner Menu On The Travelzoo Offer,,,,,
,456,Perhaps Monitor Food Preparation Somehow. ,,,,,
,457,Unfortunately  My Husband Does Not Enjoy The Buffet Cooked Breakfast & Prefers A Freshly Cooked To Order Breakfast.  He Found The Food Almost Cold  The Sausages & Bacon Dry.  The Staff Were Very Helpful And Sent To The Kitchen For A Freshly Prepared Breakfast  So The Problem Was Remedied  Though It Still Wasn't Quite As Good As A 'Cooked To Ordered' Breakfast.  Handpicked Hotels (Particularly The Nutfield Priory In Reigate) Does One Of The Best Breakfasts We've Ever Had.,,,,,
,460,Just Include The Spa Pool,,,,,
,463,Nope All Was Great. ,,,,,
,465,No,,,,,
,466,Gave Us An Additional Free Night???!!! Seriously  No  We Could Not Fault Any Aspect Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,468,No,,,,,
,472,The Main Bar In The Manor House Felt Like An Old Peoples Home Lounge  I Don't Mean That Discourteous But We Could Not Sit In There  Instead The French Restaurant Was Fun Looking  But Closing As It Was Mid Afternoon. The Staff Allowed My Wife And I To Purchase A Couple Of Beers And Sit Out Side And Drink Them. Despite The Cold Wind  It Was Still Better Than Sitting In The Manor House Bar.,,,,,
,475,We Ordered Our Breakfasts On Two Mornings Both Times They Were Wrong  The First Time Nothing Was Written Down The Second Time It Was But Arrived And Was Again Wrong  Only In Quantity Which Is A Terrible Waste Of Food. I Ordered 2 Poached Eggs And One Bacon  1 Sausage And 1 Hash Brown It Arrived As Two Of Everything  I Put The Extra On A Plate And It Sat There Throughout Our Meal  That Quantity Just Puts Me Off.  The Bacon Was Also Like Cardboard And Pretty Much Inedible.  There Was No Butter On The Table For Our Toast Or On The Buffet  We Had To Ask And No Marmalade Either. Very Poor.,,,,,
,477,No .,,,,,
,483,As Metnioned -
Room Service Actually Delivered
Cleaner Sheets,,,,,
,491,I Was Told When I Phoned That Having The Rhassoul  Massage And Facial Package And Scalp Massages Would Result In A Discount  But This Did Not Happen.,,,,,
,493,No,,,,,
,495,The Final Account Had Not Had Discounts Applied So We Had To Amend That  But It Was Quickly And Efficiently Fixed.  Most Importantly  There Was No Tokaji - Please Fix That Before We Come Back!!  Thanks Tibor :),,,,,
,496,The Room Upstairs In The Spa With Heated Loungers Should Be An Official Quiet Room. The Pool Area Can Be Noisy So It Would Be Nice To Go Somewhere Quiet But Still In The Spa Area  ,,,,,
,502,As The Receptionist Is The First Port Of Contact  It Is Important To Get That Right.,,,,,
,505,I Think The £5 Room Service Charge Should Be Included In Your Price. ,,,,,
,508,For The Price Of Our Room I Was Expecting A Little More And More Effort To Be Made In Regards To No Available Appointments For Treatments Or Availability In The Thai Restaurant ,,,,,
,510,We Have High Expectations As You Always Set Yourself High Standards In The Past!
To Have Got The Room Key More Easily.
Wholemeal Gluten Free Bread Rather Than White (I Know I Am Being Fussy)
We Like To Dance Argentine Tango  Jive  Westcoast Swing And Wondered Whether You Ever Have Demand For Dancing In The Manor Restaurant. I Realise It Is Quite Specialist. We Know A Lot Of Dancers  We Don't Like Disco. We Do Dance In The Studio So In A Sense That Need Is Met.
We Did Once Come When There Was Disco Music One Easter But The Music Choice Was Terrible So We Could Not Dance Very Easily.
We Did Enjoy The Chocolate Making Session A Few Years Ago At Easter And Discussed While We Were Staying This Time How We Would Enjoy Another Afternoon Course At Easter As Long As It Was Not Too Expensive Per Head. We Would Like To Have A Go At Making Easter Eggs In Moulds Ourselves. Not Sure How Practical That Would Be. I Don't Like Chocolate But Would Enjoy Having A Go At Making Something Or Learning Something About Chocolate Again.

,,,,,
,515,There Is Nothing Wrong With The Hotel  We Had A Great Stay  But We Realise It Was Not Suitable For Our Son. I Know You  Do Not Advertise As A Children-Friendly Hotel  We Just Didn't Appreciate He Would Be The Only Child!,,,,,
,516,None. ,,,,,
,517,Improved Bedroom Ambiance,,,,,
,525,No ,,,,,
,528,No,,,,,
,534,Redecorate. Persuade Your Restaurant Managers To Smile And Be Proactive.,,,,,
,536,Seating For Breakfast Is A Little Open Plan. The Chairs Were Placed Facing The People Opposite. Hence Next Day We Had Room Service.,,,,,
,544,Duty Manager Could Have Tried To Turn Our Experience Around Instead Of Just Agreeing About The Refurbishment And Telling Us It S The Going Rate.,,,,,
,545,If U Advertise Discounts For Spa Breaks Eg Discounts For More Than One Treatment And £40 Allowance For Evening Meal Then This Should Be Reflected In Final Bill  It Should Not Have To Be Raised By The Customer Following Overcharging.,,,,,
,548,No,,,,,
,553,Made The Day Last Longer  We Didn't Want To Leave The Spa!! No Honestly Everything Was Brilliant.,,,,,
,555,A 2Pm Check-In Maybe,,,,,
,563,The Room Service Could Have Been Improved To Deliver The Prosecco At The Time We Ordered. ,,,,,
,564,Nothing Beyond What I've Already Mentioned. I Suppose We Got Lost A Number Of Times! Not Well Signposted On The Whole  But Got Quite Funny Really And At Least The Hotel Doesn't Have The Appearance Of A Conference Centre.,,,,,
,566,The Booking Process Could Have Been Better - Phones Answered Quicker And A Better Deal By Booking Direct With You - Stops Commission To Booking Engine.,,,,,
,568,No.,,,,,
,573,It Was Lovely To Have Balloons In Our Room With The A Gift Of Some Chocolates.  That Was Lovely - Thank You.
There Was Nothing Else That You Could Have Done ,,,,,
,577,Signage For Cars On Arriving Not That Clear - Turned Toward Front Of Hotel And Found A Wedding Had To Drive Round To The Back Were We Could Have Been Sent Anyway.  Ironically Ended Up Parking Very Close To Our Room.  Had I Know That Would Not Have Lugged Furniture All The Way To Reception And Then Needed Help Carrying It Back,,,,,
,578,No,,,,,
,581,No I Don't Think So. Forgot To Mention Earlier That We  (Our Party Of 5 Guests) Also Appreciated The Complimentary Lifts To/From The Rail Station.,,,,,
,582,The Only Thing That I Would Mention Is That With Our Breakfast In Bed A Couple Of Things Were Forgotten But This Was Soon Rectified. ,,,,,
,585,As It Was Our Anniversary  A Complimentary Bottle Of Wine/Champagne Would Have Been The Finishing Touch To A Lovely Stay.,,,,,
,587,Full Spa Access As Previously Mentioned.,,,,,
,591,No It Was Lovely,,,,,
,592,Everything Was Just Perfect.,,,,,
,595,No,,,,,
,602,Think The Breakfast Is A Bit 'Holiday Inn' With Fantastic Food In The Evening  A Cooked To Order Breakfast Is Tops In My Book  Plus Toast Delivered In A Rack  It Spells Luxury   Also Porridge Was Super Creamy  A Preference To Whether Milk Water Or Cream To Be Used Should Be Asked.
The Black Pudding Is My Fav  Yet It Steamed Is Not :( 
,,,,,
,603,No,,,,,
,607,The View From The Roadside Which We Have Seen Many Times In Passing Gives A Different Impression  Thought U Would Grounds And A Nice View,,,,,
,608,I Would Like To See Breakfast Served Until 11  Allowing More Time To Get Up  Relax And Pack Before Check Out. Especially On A Weekend When It Appears That The Only People Who Get A Lay In Are The Staff (8-10). 

Also The Gluten Free Options On The Breakfast Menu Were Limited. Gf Sausages Would Be A Welcome Addition. ,,,,,
,613,No  The Issues That Occured Were Dealt With Well And We Had A Lovely Wedding Anniversary,,,,,
,618,The Lounge Is A Little Tired And Dated So We Would Suggest You Look At Updating This Facility.  ,,,,,
,627,Nothing Comes To Mind.,,,,,
,634,No Truly Perfect As Always,,,,,
,636,Other Than The Dinner  It Was All Great.,,,,,
,637,No  It Was Excellent From Start To Finish And We Had The Perfect Time.,,,,,
,640,No  Just Brilliant. ,,,,,
,641,Fantastic Keep It Up.,,,,,
,646,It Was Lovely I Would Advise Friends To Visit,,,,,
,650,Nothing At All. ,,,,,
,652,The Hot Buffet Breakfast Was Not Very Warm At All. By Time I Had Returned To The Table The Fried Eggs Were Cold  Bacon And Mushrooms Were Only Just Warm  Which After A Lovely Stay Was A Shame.,,,,,
,653,No.,,,,,
,657,No,,,,,
,658,No,,,,,
,665,An Acknowledgement Of Wifes Birthday Would Have Been Appreciated,,,,,
,668,Our Table For Dinner Was Booked For 8.45Pm. We Arrived In The Lounge At Around 8.00Pm For Drinks. We Were Informed Twice That We Could Dine Earlier If Required. At Around 8.25Pm  Another Chap Appeared And Quite Strongly Informed Us That It Was Time To Take Our Seats. Just Seemed Like We Were Being Rushed.,,,,,
,670,A Fridge In The Room Would Have Been Welcome. ,,,,,
,671,Was Disappointed That The Second Night Cost So Much More For A Slice Of Toast Each.
,,,,,
,673,Later Checkout Perhaps,,,,,
,675,No,,,,,
,676,I Think The Breakfast Could Be Improved. I Think Eggs Should Be Cooked To Order And In Fact For This Quality Of Hotel I Think Breakfast Should Be Cooked To Order Anyway. The Buffet Cooked Breakfast Was Not V Good. The Food Had Dried Out And Was A Bit Tasteless. ,,,,,
,677,No,,,,,
,682,Be More Generous With The Quantity Of Bathroom Products.
Check Who You Give The Upgrade To For A Party Booking More Than One Room!,,,,,
,689,We Were Supposed To Get An Discounted Rate For Additional Treatments Of 15% Which Was Not Applied  But This Was Not Listed Against Our Booking. This Tarnished The Visit Very Slightly But Could Be Rectified By Ensuring The Notes On The Booking Were Available ,,,,,
,691,We Had A Slight Disappointment On Our Previous Stay In That We Were Allocated A Double Instead Of Twin Room  So There Was A Degree Of Hesitancy For The Return Trip - But Everything Was Spot On.,,,,,
,694,No,,,,,
,700,The Use Of Mobile Telephones Should Be Banned In The Dining Room/Breakfast Room - Not Only Did We Have To Hear Guests Using Their Telephones We Also Had A Guest Who Put It On Speaker Phone ! We Would Have Expected Staff To Take Action To Stop This In Consideration Of Other Guests,,,,,
,705,Nothing.,,,,,
,718,Drinking Water Dispenser Outside Sauna  More Loungers By Pool And Prevention Of Lounger Reserving Via Towels.,,,,,
,720,Better Service  Reasonably Priced Food Choices Ie We Have Never Ever Paid £11.50 For Cheese And Biscuits 
Also The General Appearance Of Certain Areas In The Hotel Could Do With A Make Over. Carpets Thread Bear Etc,,,,,
,723,Included Breakfast I Think For Sum Of 436.00 We Should Have Something Included Even Contenintal Breakfast ,,,,,
,729,Bar Area Was A Bit Of A Disappointment
1. Needs Draft Beer As Well As Lager. We Actually Walked Down The Road To The Pub In The End To Get A Draft Beer.
2. Needs A Selection Of Crisps / Snacks In The Bar. We Arrived Late On The Saturday And A Packet Of Crisps Would Have Been Great!
3. The Lounge Area Next To The Bar Was Nice  But It Was Very Noisy On The Saturday Night Due To A Wedding. ,,,,,
,733,Because You Asked!  Fire Door By 57 Was Stuck Open (Later Fixed During Stay)  Bathrobes Were Removed During Stay  Toilet Paper Was Not Replaced (One Day)  Safe Deposit Was Not Available (Reported Twice) ...
We Found The Main Lounge Too Dark; Inadequate Lighting.,,,,,
,734,The Music At Breakfast On Sunday Morning Was A Little Too Upbeat  And My Husbands Coffee Wasn't Up To His Standards (He Is A Bit Of A Coffee Snob....!) He Suggested That A Barista Should Be There For Breakfast.,,,,,
,739,Nothing As The Stay Was Just Fantastic,,,,,
,744,No.,,,,,
,745,Just Would Have Been Nice To Have A Two Day Deal In Staying Rather Than Making Us Pay Extra Ontop Of Payment In Order To Stay A Second Night. We Were Told If We Stayed Again Whilst There Was Room It Would Mean A Lot Of Juggling People About Plus Be More Than The Cost Of Our First Night. Hence We Did Not Book A Second Night Despite Needing It. ,,,,,
,747,No  We Would Have Like To Have Stayed Longer.,,,,,
,749,Served Cooked Breakfast,,,,,
,752,All Comments Already Made. Didn't Answer Part 2 Of Question 20 As My Friend Settled The Bill And I Am Yet To Look It Over Myself. Answer To 21 Would Be Exceeded In Almost All Respects  But Not All.,,,,,
,757,No Music At Breakfast! Or  If Music  Not Late Night Jazz!,,,,,
,758,Breakfast Options Were A Little Limited - Didn't Realise Could Order Other Things Until The Last Day.,,,,,
,760,Modern Room (Felt It Was A Little Old Fashioned)

Towels And Robes In Male Changing Rooms.

,,,,,
,763,I Was Disappointed With The Indian Head Massage As It Was Really Poor And Quite An Expensive Gift Form A Dear Friend.,,,,,
,767,The Only Thing That Let's You Down Is The Standard Of The Decorations And Furnishings In The Manor Restaurant  The Carpet Is So Badly Covered In Black Marks It Really Is Grim  It Looks Especially Bad In The Morning At Breakfast. The Seats Are Comfortable But Again Look Faded And Dirty And The Silk Curtains Are Shredding Which Happens With Age. This Is Such A Shame As The Food  The Staff  And The Building Itself Offer A Wonderful Experience. I Appreciate In This Climate Refurbishments Are Difficult To Factor In But Sooner Rather Than Later Perhaps?,,,,,
,768,Improve Decor And Furniture In Lounge. Get Rid Of Net Curtains In Bedroom- No Pretty View. ,,,,,
,769,Arrange The Spa Bookings In A Way That Suits All Patrons Whatever Age And Have A Little More Flexibility  Maybe Book The Allocated Time Out But Allow The Customer To Change Her Treatment When She Arrives And Can See Exactly What She Is Having. No Flexibility With This At All And All The Stairs And Coldness And Ambiance In The Spa Reception Could Be More Inviting. I Have Visited The Four Seasons Most Recently And Their Spa Is Most Certinly Value For Money And Wins Hands Down Fir Relaxation. It Would Be Really Nice To See Some Of These Changes To Allow Me To Visit Once More. Feel Very Let Down By This Area.,,,,,
,774,The Used Robe  Yuk. Made Me Unconfident Of Cleanliness Of Towels And Bedding.,,,,,
,775,No,,,,,
,777,Some Acknowledgment Of Our Newly Wed Status Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,
,778,To Be Able To Book One Night Stay Easier Without Making A Lot Of Calls.,,,,,
,782,Improve The Breakfast Which Was Very Average ,,,,,
,788,No.,,,,,
,794,Scots Might Like Oatcakes At Breakfast!,,,,,
,795,Offer Better Value For Money.,,,,,
,796,Put Another Toaster In Your Dining Room.,,,,,
,802,Love The Hotel  Disappointed With Le Blaireau.,,,,,
,803,Perhaps The Ability To Make Toast At Breakfast In A More Streamlined Fashion Would Have Been Beneficial.,,,,,
,817,Improve The Signage On Arrival - We Ended Up Walking A Long Way To Find Reception. The Sign Said Senspa Reception - It Wasn't Clear That It Was The Way To The Hotel Reception - A Minor Point But It Is At The Start Of The Stay! Would Like To Say That A Member Of Staff Came To Our Rescue And Took The Cases And Guided Us To The Right Place.,,,,,
,818,Perhaps You Could Look At The Furniture In The Main Lounge Its Getting A Bit Tired Stains On The Arms ,,,,,
,819,See Earlier Comments,,,,,
,821,No,,,,,
,822,A Guide To The Tv Channels Available Would Have Been Useful.  A Dvd Player In The Room Is Standard In A Lot Of The Hotels I Stay In And Would Have Been Useful As I Was Travelling With My Son And He Could Have Watched Some Films In The Evening.  The Internet Connection Could Be Improved.,,,,,
,823,Having Mentioned It Was For A Birthday Celebration On Booking And That Was Only Done The Night Before Due To Not Knowing How I Would Be Feeling After Chemo.  I Would Of Thought Perhaps A Dessert Or Something Similar Could Have Been Arranged Bearing In Mind The Cost Of Accommodation Etc.  Not Much To Ask.,,,,,
,826,No It Was All Lovely.  Breakfast Was Also Excellent  Maybe Some Seasonal Fruits Such  As Strawberries Would Have Been  Nice  But Otherwise Great! ,,,,,
,827,Stayed Longer!,,,,,
,829,Update Decor In Bedroom Or Renovate.
Made Treatments More Affordable.,,,,,
,830,Very Satisfied.,,,,,
,831,Only Dining Area Outside,,,,,
,833,No,,,,,
,835,It Was A Little Too Quiet In The Manor Restaurant But That's Not The Hotel's Fault!,,,,,
,838,No We Were Very Happy With Everything,,,,,
,842,No I Think I've Said All That I Need To,,,,,
,843,No,,,,,
,845,Let Me Stay For Longer  Free Of Charge And Rang My Director To Explain Why I Wasnt At Work! ,,,,,
,846,No  You Even Arranged For Lovely Weather!,,,,,
,847,Nothing,,,,,
,849,Comments Previously Made,,,,,
,851,No,,,,,
,853,The Only Thing Which Disappointed Us This Time Was The New Spa Shop Arrangement We Missed All The Extra Tables And Shelves Of Jewellery And Bags Etc.,,,,,
,857,I Loved The Fact That Someone Wait For Us Outside On Our Arrival   Not Very Usual ,,,,,
,859,We Did Have A Nice Time  But Didn't Use Much Of The Facilities Apart From Our Room.

I Really Do Think You Need To Get Some Advice Upon The Needs Of The Disabled.  For Example The Tables In The Dining Room.  The Doors From The Car Park Near The Spa  Only One Set Open Automatically.  Gravel Everywhere  Makes It Impossible To Push A Wheelchair Across It.  Steps  No Ramp At Front Door Entrance  So You Are Forced To Use The Car And Leave By The Side Entrance.  Very Large Step Down From Sliding Doors In Room Out On To Garden  My Mother Could Not Step Down Such A Steep Step  Subsequently We Couldn't Sit Out.

Staff Were Friendly.,,,,,
,863,See Above,,,,,
,866,Asked The Guests To Be Quiet As Some Of Them Were Really Noisy.,,,,,
,868,To Offer Better Quality Of Food At The Breakfast And Lunch Inclided In The Spa Weekend Offer. My Husband Did Also Find A Hair On His Meal.
Improve The Cleanliness Of The Oak Rooms Bathroom. No Full Body Mirrow In The Room.,,,,,
,870,No,,,,,
,871,I Think With Hindsight That I Perhaps Did Not Make The Booking In The Most Cost-Effective Way. Our Total Bill For One Day Inc Spa  Treatments And Dinner Was £921.00 Which  In Retrospect   Seems Steep   And I Wonder Whether If I Had Booked By Telephone  Your Staff Might Perhaps Have Advised Instead A Spa Package That Could Have Been Added To?  ,,,,,
,874,Wi-Fi Speed Was Not Great ,,,,,
,877,Not Really.,,,,,
,879,Would Have Liked More Garden Space/Seating.,,,,,
,882,See Previous Comments. 
It Is A Lovely Hotel And The Option To Eat In The French Bistro Is Quite Unique And A Valuable Extra But The Service Level Received On Using Senspa On This Occasion Was Not Good. Not Offered Sandals  For Example  Robes Were Grubby  Not Explained  That We Could Not Use The Hydrothereapy Areas  Or Why. Not Shown Around. I Have Used This Before And Had Better Experiences.,,,,,
,889,Very Good!,,,,,
,891,Impossible,,,,,
,892,No,,,,,
,898,No,,,,,
,901,No The Service Was Very Good,,,,,
,903,Think That The Stay And Meal Were Excellent Although There Were Obviously Special Guests At Dinner Who Enjoyed An Even More Attentive Service. As We Were There For A 50Th Birthday I Felt That We Were Not Treated Quite As Well.,,,,,
,907,The Coffee Selection And The Quality Of Tea Could Be Improved. ,,,,,
,913,When Booking I Was Not Made Aware Of The Discount Available (£100 Off) For 3 Days Or More And I Only Found This By Going Onto The Website Subsequently.  I Phoned Again And Was Told That This Was Available But I Had To Have 3 B&B Days Which Seemed Odd As For Choice I Would Have Preferred To Book 3 Db&B And 2 B&B.  However I Was Told That I Couldn't Even Though This Would Have Been More Expensive!  When Checking Out  This Discount Was Not Applied. I Queried It And Was Told That It Was "Probably " Reflected In The Room Rates  But I Found The Original Booking And Was Able To Point This Out. ,,,,,
,918,No,,,,,
,920,Perhaps I Booked At The Wrong Time To Receive Anything Like A Reasonable Offer  But Paying Over £500 For 2 Nights B&B I Was Expecting A Wow And That Just Isn't There. I Put Most Of It Down To The Expansion And "Modernisation" That Was Done Some Time Back That Has Left The Original Manor Part Of The House A Very Small Part Of The Overall. I Would Stay Again  But Only If On A Deal That I Saw Value For Money - Ie At Least Half What I Paid.,,,,,
,922,Every Night Different Music,,,,,
,923,The Meal Could Have Been Better. ,,,,,
,929,Have Bicycles Available To Rent At The Hotel. Have Walking Route Maps Available/Ordnance Survey Maps To Borrow.,,,,,
,930,Not The Best Stay. Bottle Of Preseco Not In Room On First Night As Promised  I Had To Ask Three Different People At Different Times On The Second Day Until Someone Delivered Bottle To Room. I Expected This To Be Dealt With With Only One Request  Not Three.

 Breakfast On The First Morning. Ordered A Vegetarian Breakfast  Which Took Nearly 30Mins To Arrive  Had To Ask Three People Where It Was And Was Assured It Was On It Way. I Had Finished My Breakfast And Sat Waiting In An Emptying Breakfast Room As My Wife Became More Agitated At The Lack Of Her Breakfast And Service.

Despite Booking Over The Phone And 'Paying' For My First Night At The Time  I Was Shocked To See A Full Bill On Check-Out  Which Included The First Night. I Was Informed That This Sometimes Happens And That If I Went Away And Checked My Bank And I Had Been Charged Twice That I Could Call Up And Get A Refund.

Overall  What Was Supposed To Be A Luxurious And Relaxing Break Was Not What I Expected For The Price I Paid I Expected A Much Better Overall Experience.

I Have Had To Put My Wife Off Posting Her Review On Trip-Advisor Until I Have Given You The Chance To Reply To My Concerns.

,937,We Had To Ask For The Celebration Balloons. Obviously It Was Known I Was Celebrating My Birthday (Advised By My Sister In Law And Presents Left In Room) But The Chocolates Holding The Ballons Was A Lovely Touch And Very Enjoyable. Thank You. ,,,,,
,940,I Believe This Rooms Issue Was Known   Yet Room Was Still Give To Us.,,,,,
,943,As My Wife And I Are Both Very Senior Citizens  A Lift Would Be Very Helpful!!,,,,,
,945,Just A Lift!!,,,,,
,946,Beer On Tap In The Bar ,,,,,
,953,Spa Products In The Bathroom,,,,,
,954,Just What I Said Above In The Comments. I Am Happy To Always Come Back And Pass On My Views If You Feel They Are Fair.,,,,,
,959,The Above Statement Is Difficult To Comment On.  If We Had Been 2 Able-Bodied People  Then Our Experience Would Have Been Excellent.  With A Disabled Husband  However  I Struggled All Week To Manoeuvre His Wheelchair Up A Steep Slope And Through Narrow Doorways.,,,,,
,961,The Request For Mrs Lamplugh To Settle Her Bill Before She Arrived Was Confusing And Embarrassing. I Had Previously Rung To Inform The Hotel That I Would Bear The Charges. There Was No Communication Between The Phone Message And Check-In Staff.
The Fact That Her Room Was Not Available At 3Pm Was Annoying. Please Employ At Least Some Staff Whose First Language Is English,,,,,
,968,Maybe Would Of Had A Different Treatment,,,,,
,969,N/A,,,,,
,972,We Were Not There Long Enough To Comment Further,,,,,
,973,No,,,,,
,976,Asked Us Of Preference Of Room  Our Room Was Beautiful However Was Such A Lovely Afternoon And Below People Were Sat Outside There Rooms Downstairs. This Would Have Been Nice To Also Do. However I Understand You Could Have Been Fully Booked. ,,,,,
,979,Let Us Know Room Was Ready Earlier,,,,,
,980,No,,,,,
,982,The Ordering Special Breakfast Items Didn't Really Work.  I Asked If I Could Order Some Hot Food (Which Is Confusing In Itself As There Is A Buffet Full Of Hot Food).   I Asked For Poached Eggs But Felt My European Waitress Did Not Really Grasp It Although She Was Very Pleasant.  After A While I Chased The Breakfast Up  Not Knowing If It Was Really On The Way Or If It Had Been Ordered At All.,,,,,
,983,More Spa Access,,,,,
,985,N/A,,,,,
,986,Golf Course Was Very Baffling No Signs And Completely Confusing ,,,,,
,987,Quieter Room. ,,,,,
,988,Sort Out Basic Issues.,,,,,
,989,No. ,,,,,
,991,Serve A Hot Breakfast,,,,,
,993,No,,,,,
,994,Just Be A Bit More Friendly/Welcoming,,,,,
,997,The Overall Bill  Was To Say The Least Very Confusing To Work Out Whether It Was Accurate Or Not Due To The £5 Friday Offer. ,,,,,
,1001,It Sounds A Bit Trivial But We Were Disappointed That We Had To Order Baked Beans Separately At Breakfast. Though The Last Time We Stayed I Suggested Having Vege Sausages On The Menu Which There Were And Was Brilliant To See. ,,,,,
,1011,1. We Had Afternoon Tea And It Was Lovely But The Waiter Seemed A Little Rushed And Brought The Tea  10 Mins Later The Cakes And Then Finally The Sandwiches.  As We Only Do This Once A Year Or More It Did Detract Slightly From The Experience  As The Tea Was Cold By The Time We Had The Sandwiches.  ,,,,,
,1014,We Do Feel It Is Time You Addressed Decor In The Corridoors  Staircases And Carpets Which Are Starting To Looking A Bit Untidy Away From The Main Building.,,,,,
,1019,Just The Provision Of A Fridge Perhaps.,,,,,
,1020,Check In At 3Pm Was Too Late And Then We Had To Rush To Get Out Of Our Room By 11Am The Next Day Following Treatments At 0930. ,,,,,
,1024,Air Condition All Your Hotel And Spa,,,,,
,1029,Better Quality Breakfast,,,,,
,1031,Honestly  No. You Were Great. The 10% Discount For Train Travellers Was Entirely Unexpected (And Inexplicable  But I'm Not Complaining).
I Will Remember To Leave A Bit More Time When Checking Out On A Sunday Next Time. That Was The Only Time I Had To Wait For Anything  And My Mild Sense Of Urgency Was Only Because I Had A Train To Catch.,,,,,
,1032,This Was The First Hotel Room We'd Stayed In Which Didn't Have A Fridge As Standard.  Because Of The Hear We Could Have Done With A Supply Of Cold Water - The Bottles In The Room Were Too Warm To Drink.  A Fan Or Air Conditioning Would Have Meant We Were More Comfortable In The Heat.,,,,,
,1039,1) Followed Our Dietary Requirements We Made When Booking.
2) Showed Due Attention During Our Dining Experience At The Manor Restaurant.,,,,,
,1042,Nothing ,,,,,
,1052,This Is Not My Comment Because I Did Not Notice  But My Father Pointed Out A Really Shabby Sofa In Your Lounge That Is In Need Of Upholstering! ,,,,,
,1053,To Make Up For The Disappointing Bathroom - Fluffy Robes.,,,,,
,1055,Improve The Dining Experience  Refurbish The Restaurant And Add Extra Products To The Bedroom To Make It A Little Bit More Special. I Don't See That You're Worthy Of A Top 50 Independent Hotel Place. I Feel Let Down By The Experience Relative To The Awards You've Apparently Received.,,,,,
,1056,No,,,,,
,1057,Air Conditioning In Our Room. Friendlier Bar Staff.,,,,,
,1058,The Whole Hotel Needs To Be Refurbished And The Standard Of Fixtures And Fittings In The Rooms Improved To Give You A More Luxurious Experience. ,,,,,
,1062,Ensure That The Food And Service In The French Bistro Was As Anticipated,,,,,
,1066,No.,,,,,
,1074,I Think My Comments So Far Explain These. ,,,,,
,1075,Consider Opening A Hair Salon Perhaps?,,,,,
,1076,The Breakfast Area Is Very Dark - Not A Good Start To The Day.  Lacks The Feel Good Factor.,,,,,
,1078,Give The Manor House A Facelift  Train The Staff  Reprice The Rooms.  There Is A Lot Of Competition In The New Forest  Careys Manor Will Lose Out If It Doesn't Sort Out A Decent Marketing Strategy. ,,,,,
,1081,No  We Really Enjoyed It And Appreciated The Little Details Such As The Chocolates And Note Welcoming Us Back  And The Phonecall After We Had Arrived At The Room To Check That Everything Was Okay.,,,,,
,1082,Nothing  It Was Perfect From Start To Finish,,,,,
,1085,Allocate A Locker Number To Spa Package Guests So That They Can Find One  And Fill It What They Need To Save Asking Around For Shoes Or Pound Coins. Tell Guest The Length Of Their Treatment Beforehand And Allow Them To Get Up Within A Few Moments Not Straight Away. The Hour Long Massage That I Had Did Do This For Me And The Therapist Was Very Good.,,,,,
,1089,Although A Couple Of Mistermeaners We Would Come Back. Just Though It Worth Highlighting So The Food Issues Can Be Addressed.,,,,,
,1094,The Receptionist Failed To Take Off The £40 Credit From Our Dinner Despite Claiming To Do So So We Had To Check The Bill And Ask Her To Make The Correction.  Reception At Times Felt Very Very Busy And Short Staffed,,,,,
,1095,Improve The Bistro Menu And Service,,,,,
,1096,Checking In Before 3Pm Would Have Been Nice So We Could Have Enjoyed More Of The Time We Had. ,,,,,
,1098,The Couple Of Minor Points Regarding The Room,,,,,
,1104,No,,,,,
,1107,Other Than Create A Shortcut From The Parking Facilities To The Main Reception Desk - No,,,,,
,1110,No,,,,,
,1113,Some More Information Before We Arrived Would Have Been Excellent. But Were Unaware Of How Things Went Etc. 
Also Struggled Keeping Drinks In Our Room Cold  Mini Fridge Would Have Helped ! Apart From That Was Amazing Few Days.,,,,,
,1115,Nothing Apart From The Few Small Issues Already Raised.,,,,,
,1116,/,,,,,
,1119,Just Get The Small Things Right Like Constant Hot Water & Not Having To Ask 3 Times For Coffee At Breakfast  Make Sure The Bill Is Correct On Departure,,,,,
,1123,Overall  We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay! ,,,,,
,1126,Nothing,,,,,
,1129,Please See Previous Comments About Children Being Charged Full Rate But Not Allowed To Use Full Facilities(Swimming Pool). I Would Expect A Discounted Rate For This.,,,,,
,1136,More Care At The Meal  Taken Money Off The Bill Would Have Been Good. Not Double Booked Room. ,,,,,
,1137,Points Made Earlier In Survey,,,,,
,1138,My Bete Noir At Breakfast  Cold Plates For The Hot Food - Means That By The Time You Sit Down To Eat It The Food Is Cold Which Is Such A Shame.  Because Of This We Ordered Kipper Fillet's' But They Turned Out To Be Just One Which Seemed A Little Measly.  If You Were To Provide Warm Plates It Would Be An Entirely Different Matter!,,,,,
,1143,Needed Cash For Taxi Ride To Station. No Cash Machine At Hotel  No Cash Back Service Available At Bar Or Reception.,,,,,
,1144,No,,,,,
,1145,See Above,,,,,
,1147,Access To Spa.,,,,,
,1149,Informed That There Was A Wedding On At The Same Time Of Our Stay  As The Entertainment Was Loud But Luckily It Finished By 2300 Hrs.,,,,,
,1157,Start Over Again With A Better Chief  Less Chieftains And More Trained Indians.,,,,,
,1163,Better Communal Areas  Less Formal  More Natural Service. ,,,,,
,1165,I Think The Bath Robes Could Do With Replacing / Upgrading.,,,,,
,1166,No,,,,,
,1170,Let Us Come Free All The Time !!! ;0),,,,,
,1173,No,,,,,
,1175,Baked Beans With The Breakfast!,,,,,
,1176,Proper Coffee Making Facilities In The Room Would Have Been Lovely  Even If A Little Indulgent ,,,,,
,1179,As Mentioned In Earlier Comments,,,,,
,1188,I Would Prefer An Order Taken For Breakfast And For It To Be Freshly Cooked. I Did Order Some Items From The Kitchen,,,,,
,1189,The Bill Was Wrong And We Had To Go For Our Treatments So Had To Return To Sort This After We Had Our Spa Treatment . It Was Corrected In This Time So Was Smooth After The Treatment,,,,,
,1193,Overall Service Was Good - Where It Falls Down Badly Is During The Day When We Wanted Drinks/Coffee From The Bar. Either No One Around   Too Busy   Wrong Orders Etc - Lovely To Sit In The Garden But Poor If You Can't Get Service There,,,,,
,1194,Transport To And From The Station Would Have Rounded Off My Experience Well.,,,,,
,1195,No,,,,,
,1197,See Comments On Breakfast.,,,,,
,1201,Only Because It Was Excellent The Last Time,,,,,
,1202,Improve The Food At The Manor Restaurant And General Ambience.,,,,,
,1205,Make The Showers Better.,,,,,
,1209,Turn Down Service  Faster Restaurant/Bar Service  Friendlier Restaurant Staff ,,,,,
,1210,No  I Am Looking Forward To Coming Again.,,,,,
,1214,Noise From The Wedding Party Was Disturbing. 

A Member Of Staff Came To The Door At 10.45 One Night (There Seemed To Be A Problem In Our Area (Someone Smoking Maybe?). This Was Followed By The Fire Alarm At 12 30 In The Morning. A Very Disturbed Night.,,,,,
,1217,Just Feel Disappointed As This Was A Rare Night Away From The Children And We Had Only Just Got Married.,,,,,
,1218,Breakfast Definetely Could Have Been Better As Could The Waitressing Staff At Breakfast.,,,,,
,1219,We Did Not Get The Advertised Discount For The Treatments That We Booked And As Soon As We Noticed It We Had To Ask The Reception To Correct And Refund Some Of Our Money Back.,,,,,
,1220,Pillow Choice.,,,,,
,1221,Make The Interior Design Feel More Up To Date And Fresh,,,,,
,1223,Better Service.,,,,,
,1225,Improve The Bar Service In The Cocktail Bar  It Was Appalling!,,,,,
,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,
,1,The Only Thing Preventing Us From Coming Back Right Away Is The Cost. It Would Be Really Good To See More One Off Offers For Cheap Short Breaks Away.,,,,,
,2,We Hope To Come Back Again In The Future.,,,,,
,5,Impressive Senspa Facilities And Set The Mood Amazingly. Four Poster Bedroom Was Of High Quality. Only Let Down Was The Zen Garden Which Was An Embarrassing Experience From Start To Finish - Never Made To Feel Like That Wherever I Have Eaten Around The World - Regret Not Saying Something To The Member Of Staff At The Time And Should Of  But Moment Has Gone Now! ,,,,,
,6,When We Were Checking Out  The Porter Offered To Retrieve Our Car From The Car Park  Which I Hadn't Experience On My Previous Visits And Thought That This Was A Really Nice Touch. It Was Cold And Damp Outside And It Saved A Walk With Our Luggage.,,,,,
,13,We Have Really Loved Our Many Previous Stays At Carey's  But We Talked About This Weekend's Disappointments On Our Way Home And Have Decided To Try Out Some Other Places For Future Weekends Away. Sorry Carey's!,,,,,
,14,I Am Really Excited About Coming With Colleagues To The Conference In July - They Will Be Thrilled With The Venue I Have Managed To Find!,,,,,
,15,I Paid £223 Per Night Online. My Keycard Said The Room Rate Was £189. That Disturbed Me A Bit  But I Didn't Mention It As The Amount Was Already Agreed.,,,,,
,16, The Receptio Was Often Unmanned.,,,,,
,17,Although We Probably Would Visit Again The Service In Restaurant Has Put Us Off A Bit And Wouldn't Like To Recommend To Anyone.  I Said To The Duty Manager At The Time That The Meal Was Included For Us In The Package However If I Was Having To Pay For Dinner On Top Of A Stay At £70+ In That Restaurant I Would Expect More Efficient Service.  If We Come Back Again We Will Probably Try The Manor Restaurant.   A Big Thank You To All Hotel Staff That Made Our Anniversary So Special. We Wanted A Relaxing Break And Apart From The Service In The Restaurant Evening Else Was Perfect.  Although I Can't Remember Everyone's Names We Came Into Contact With  All Of The Hotel Staff Were Smiling And Always Gave Efficient Service.  It Was Lovely To Have A Chilled Bottle Of Wind And Choc And Balloon In Our Room On Arrival With Note From Manager. Very Nice Touch. ,,,,,
,25,We Live In Winchester  So Fairly Close And We Will Often Go A Short Distance For A Weekend Away.  We Will Definitely Be Visiting Again ,,,,,
,30,Excellent Spa That I Would Recommend To People But I Would Tell Them Not To Dine In The Restaurant But I Would Recommend Zenspa For Lunch,,,,,
,32,Thank You  I Have Gone Back To Work To Pay For The Next One !,,,,,
,36,Would Highly Recommend And Cant Wait To Return,,,,,
,41,When I State That Our Expectations Were Met Rather Than Exceeded  It Was Simply Because As We Have Visited On Many Occasions  Our Expectations Are High  And They Are Always Met!  Really Big Well Done And Thank You To All.,,,,,
,43,Hope To Repeat This Experience Very Soon,,,,,
,49,The Hotel And Spa Is Amazing And No Doubt We'll Continue To Visit On An Annual Basis For A Weekend Break.  ,,,,,
,53,If I Was To Come Back It Would Only Be For Spa Facilities  Which Is Unlikely. Overall Unfortunately It Was Disappointing Experience And I Would Not Come Back Again.  ,,,,,
,59,We Do So Love Our 'Pampering Treat' And Travel From Swansea Twice A Year To Indulge! It Is Well Worth The Journey And Have Not Experienced Any Spa Break That Comes Anywhere Near Careys Manor,,,,,
,60,Will Come Again!,,,,,
,66,No Comments Entered.,,,,,
,67,None!,,,,,
,71,Thank You For A Very Special  Pampering Few Days  It Makes Coming Back To The Real World That Bit More Difficult :-) ,,,,,
,73,Well Done For Nurturing Such A Positive Customer Care Attitude!,,,,,
,80,During The Weekend Stay Each Member Of The Party Found That Their Room Key Cards Failed And Needed To Be Re-Booted At Least Once During The Weekend  Sometimes Twice.  As We Were In Rooms 95 To 98 This Was A Long Trek Back To Reception And So A Pain.  Also Our Wrist Bands For Spa Facility Access Failed To Workand  Needed To Be Re-Booted On The Sunday Morning.  This Added Up To Plenty Of Additional Wandering Around.,,,,,
,92,None,,,,,
,94,My Only Negative Comment Is That The Spa Is So Much Busier Than It Has Been In Previous Years.,,,,,
,97,Would The Hotel Consider Arranging Organised Walking Tours In The New Forest?,,,,,
,98,Your Manager Was Very Kind In The First Place To Allow Us To Re-Book Our Spa Break  After We Had To Cancel At Very Short Notice Indeed On 30Th October  Through No Fault Of Our Own  And We Really Appreciated His Kind Gesture.  Also  When It Came To The Bill  I Commented That I Thought That Your Phone Charges From The Room Telephone Were Exhorbitant  Which I Know Is Often The Case In Hotels  And He Was Kind Enough To Make An Adjustment On That.  Overall  We Felt You Had Been More Than Accomodating Towards Us.,,,,,
,102,Very Happy. 3Rd Time And Would Come Again. ,,,,,
,104,Was Disapointed With The Check In Time Of 15.00 Hours This Is Fine If You Are A Business User But For Leisure You Need To Be Booked In And Checked Out To Be Able To  Make Use Of The Facilities Paid For In The Price.,,,,,
,105,Ditto,,,,,
,106,We Would Like To Receive Information Regarding Spa Membership Or Packages For More Frequent Stays/Spa Weekends.,,,,,
,113,On Both My Visits The Bill Was A Total Mess - Customers Should Be Given A Copy Of The Dockets They Sign As They Are In Other Hotels - At Least Then We Would Have Something To Tally With The Bill When It Is Presented,,,,,
,121,I Just Wish That It Wasn't So Expensive To Stay And Use The Spa. Then I Would Stay Longer. ,,,,,
,127,I Will Come Stay Again So Pls Keep Me Informed Of Any Offers In The New Year,,,,,
,130,It Was Lovely To Get A Free Upgrade- Simple Things Like That Make Us Want To Return For A Fourth Time.,,,,,
,132,You Have A Fantastic Team Of Staff  Especially Front Of House Who Have A Difficult Job Sometimes! Loved Very Moment  Very Sad To Go  Will Be Making It My Annual Birthday Treat As Well As A Few Well Deserved Breaks In Between. Look Forward To Coming Back Next Year. Keep Up The Good Work.,,,,,
,138,Thankyou For Giving Us A Memorable Christmas,,,,,
,139,Very Friendly And Helpful Staff. Always An Enjoyable Experience.,,,,,
,140,We Had A Brilliant Christmas Thanks To The Staff At Carey's Manor. Thank You.,,,,,
,143,None Thank You,,,,,
,147,Great Hotel .,,,,,
,148,No,,,,,
,149,Personalised Christmas Presents A Nice Touch. Our Thanks For A Wonderful Christmas.  ,,,,,
,150,See You Next Year !,,,,,
,152,Thanks  I Shall Be Returning With My Mum Before Too Long...,,,,,
,153,Account Was Amended Immediately In Regard To Question 2O.,,,,,
,154,Please Pass On Our Thanks To All The Team For Making Our Christmas So Special.,,,,,
,156,Looking Forward To My Next Stay At Careys.,,,,,
,159,Apart From Tweaks - No  You've Got The Package Completely Right And We Will Be Back.   We Visit The Hotel Regularly During The Year And Have Done For Many Years  And It Will Continue.   Its A Wonderful Place To Come For An Indulgent Break.   Thank You.  Btw  Dawn At Reservations Is Also Brilliant.   There's Nothing She Can't Organise !,,,,,
,160,I Think The Level Of Room Is Not Worth The Maximum Hotel Price Of Around 250 Pounds. I Think I Would Definitely Stay Here Again On A Date With A Cheaper Rate; But Not At The Maximum. For That Money You Would Expect Full Access To All Facilities And At Least A Minibar!,,,,,
,161,Next Time We'll Bring Our Costumes!,,,,,
,163,How Come There Is No Sommelier?,,,,,
,165,Thank You For Giving Us Our Best Christmas Ever!,,,,,
,166,It Is Unfortunate That  Today   I Found A Sewing Pin In My Christmas Cake!,,,,,
,167,Overall Excellent  Especially All Staff Who Were Very Helpful,,,,,
,168,After Staying For The 4 Day Xmas Breaks 2011 And 2012 Surprised That We Did Not Receive An E-Mail In About October And When I Checked Availability For 2013 Xmas Break Your Website Indicated That You Were Full.Then When Phoning I Was Told That There Was Availability,,,,,
,169,Wish All Staff A Very Good New Year  2014,,,,,
,171,Our Hotel Bill For One Night Came To Over £425  Staff  Particularly The Chef  Needs To Be Aware That If A Customer Is Not Happy With Something An Alternative Should Be Offered  At Very Little Cost To The Hotel.,,,,,
,174,You Have A Very Special Christmas Offering. The Formal Boxing Evening Is Clearly Not Enjoyed (Or Adhered To) Byall So Perhaps You Could Consider Offering The Boxing Day Lunch As An Alternative??,,,,,
,176,No.. I Think I Said It All ,,,,,
,183,Keep Up The Good Work!,,,,,
,184,No,,,,,
,187,Thank You To All The Hotel Staff That Made Our Stay On The 30Th & 31St December A Very Welcome And Fun Stay After An Extremely Busy Christmas.,,,,,
,189,Please Don't Change! It Is Unusual To Find Somewhere That You Leave With The Feeling - 'That Was Perfect'. It Was Not A 'Cheap Break' And With No Prior Knowledge Of Careys Manor And Senspa We Were Hoping That We Were Not Going To Feel Let Down By The Quality Of The Hotel And Facilities  As We Have Done On Previous Occasions In Different Establishments. However I Can Assure You That We Both Came Away Feeling That It Was Worth Every Penny. Furthermore  We Decided That We Need To Come Back!  ,,,,,
,190,Look Forward Once Again To Seeing You All In June  And Staying At Carey's Cottage! Carey's Is Home From Home For The Cheeseman Family!,,,,,
,191,We'll Be Back If We Are Available,,,,,
,193,Please Advise When Plans Are In Place  In  For This New Years Eve Event. ,,,,,
,194,A Couple Of Small Changes Would Have Made A World Of Difference To Our Stay Here.,,,,,
,203,Nil. You Do A Good Job,,,,,
,213,We Forgot To Bring Our Loyalty Card With Us But We Were Told At Reception That In The New Year There Would Be A New One Available And Would Be Sent To Us  Is This Available Yet?,,,,,
,214,On Departure The Manager Financially Compensated Us For Our Very Miserable Stay.  However 3 Precious Days Of Holiday Were Wasted.,,,,,
,217,Shampoo   With A Pool In Your Hotel   We Needed To Wash Our Hair More Often Than We Otherwise Would   So Some Extra Shampoo In The Room Would Be Great. ,,,,,
,221, Enjoyed An Excellent Stay I Was Surprised How Well The Event Was Organised. Best New Year's Eve Night - For Many A Year. We Would Recommend It To Friends.,,,,,
,222,Impressed That All The Food Was Served On Hot Plates When Appropriate.  The Quality For A 'Mass Catered' Event Was Very Good. It Was A Shame We Couldn't Explore Further Because Of The Weather  But We Would Certainly Return In The Future ,,,,,
,224,Would Have Booked It Myself But The Spa Break Was A Present.  I Am Now A Complete Convert!,,,,,
,225,No,,,,,
,226,No Other Than We Will Come Back Asap,,,,,
,229,We Will Be Back!,,,,,
,233,Will Come Again For New Years Eve Funtions,,,,,
,234,Thanks And See You Again Soon! ,,,,,
,236,No,,,,,
,239,Thank You To You And Your Team For Making My Birthday Treat One To Remember  I Was Very Sad To Leave But I Was So Relaxed ,,,,,
,244,At The Breakfast Room There Were No Plain Yoghurts On Either Of The 2 Mornings Also The Porridge Was Not Good  Too Runny! ,,,,,
,248,We Will Be Back In The Future  But As I Have Said We Dined Out In The Village 3 Nights Out Of Four. Had The Menu Been More Varied We Would Have Dined In  The Hotel More Often,,,,,
,249,Thank You,,,,,
,254,Paying The Bill Was More Complicated Than It Needed To Be. Having Already Paid For The Rooms It Was Simply The Extras To Pay For. The Way In Which Your Computer System Breaks Down All The Costs Is Crazy Making It Very Difficult To Check The Bill. For Example - One Glass Of Champagne Appeared As Three Separate Amounts Making You Feel (Until You Realise The Amount Charged) That Three Glasses Of Champagne Were Charged For. When You Sign For An Amount  That Total Should Appear On Your Final Bill - Not A Break Down With No Total To Compare With What You Signed For. Maybe People Do Not Check Their Bills? I Certainly Do And I Do Not Think You Are Making It A Seamless Operation. In Fact  Four Ladies Who Were Paying At The Same Time As Me Were Having Great Fun With A Calculator And Many Sheets Of Paper Clearly Trying To Decipher Their Bill. You Have Given A Young Man A New Position On Reception (Someone I Recognise From The Restaurant) - He Is Credit To Your Team And A Very Good First Impression When You Check In. ,,,,,
,256,See You All Later In The Year.,,,,,
,258,Can't Wait For Our Next Visit,,,,,
,268,I Expected That The Experience At Carey's Manor Would Be Good - And It Was! The Booking Was Made As A Weekend Treat For A Special Birthday And Everything Went According To Plan.,,,,,
,272,We Also Ate In The French Restaurant For Lunch And The Food Was Lovely  The Staff Very Obliging With An Excellent Range Of Dishes On The Menu For Informal Eating. The Decor However Is Quite Tired.,,,,,
,279,Overall Hotel Staff Were Best I E Experienced  I Forgot To Mention The Sweet Lad Who Took Us To Our Room!,,,,,
,283,See You Again Soon!,,,,,
,285,No,,,,,
,291,Look Forward To My Next Visit,,,,,
,292,Keeping My Car While I Joined A P & O Cruise And Arranging Transport Between Hotel And Ship  Were Very Much Appreciated  Thank You.,,,,,
,303,See Earlier Comments - Which I Hope Will Be Treated As Constructive Criticism. Overall  We Had A Lovely Week End. ,,,,,
,304,When Checking Out We Did Not Understand The Man On Reception Because His English Was Not To Good And We Had To Ask Him To Repeat Him Self All The Time.,,,,,
,308,Back Soon ,,,,,
,309,A Very Well Run Hotel With A Touch Of Class And Warmth.
Thank You,,,,,
,310,We Loved Our Stay And Will Be Making It An Annual Event   Hopefully Biannual If Our Budgets Allow! ,,,,,
,316,The Free Independent Newspaper Was Appreciated.,,,,,
,317,On Check Out  The Invoice I Was Given Was Inaccurate As The Restaurant Receipts Had Been Charged Twice.,,,,,
,326,It Would Be Nice If Additional Treatments (On Top Of The Spa Break) Were Discounted. It Would Also Be Nice To Receive A Discount In The Spa Shop As My Wife Made A Couple Of Purchases There. If Smoothies  Fresh Fruit And Pastries Were Included In Any Spa Breaks Then This Would Also Make The Spa Experience Even Better. ,,,,,
,328,All The Staff At The Hotel  Spa And Restaurant Were Very Helpful And Went Out Of There Way To Please

Well Done All
,,,,,
,330,We Will Be Back Again Soon,,,,,
,331,Just Would Like Somebody To Contact Me And Acknowlage My Concerns During Our Stay..,,,,,
,332,We Loved Our Stay As We Always Do.,,,,,
,333,We Did Recieve Vouchers  For A 30 Minute Treatment But A Free Stay Or Spa Day To Use Them Would Be Nice ! Hope To Save Like Mad And Come Back. ,,,,,
,336,Thank You - You Created A Lasting Birthday Memory For My 40Th. We Will Return.,,,,,
,342,We Would Definitely Stay In The Garden Room Again.  We Would Like To Say Thank You For The Complimentary Champagne Put In Our Room,,,,,
,344,Hoping To Take Out A Spa Day Membership So I Can Come Along Four Times A Year :),,,,,
,345,Shower Was Hot And Could Not Turn Down ,,,,,
,357,No,,,,,
,361,Birthday Chocolates And Balloon A Lovely Touch! Thank You!
Visit Was Made By The Fabulous Customer Service. Keep It Up - Its So Rare To Find Somewhere With Great Staff.,,,,,
,363,Please See Previous Comments - Very Disappointed In Our Stay,,,,,
,364,Thank You For Letting Us Stay In Your Beautiful Hotel  And For Making Us Feel So Welcome.
Please Pass On Our Thanks To Everyone Who We Encountered And Served Us (If You Can Find That Out From The Bills  Rota Etc?) As We Were Really Impressed And Would Love To Come Back - Maybe Next Time We Won't Be Able To Stay Quite As Long As We Did  As It Did Cost Us Quite A Bit Of Money!,,,,,
,366,No,,,,,
,368,Thank You Very Much.,,,,,
,369,Thoroughly Recommend The Hotel .,,,,,
,373,Excellent Stay. Would Recommend.,,,,,
,374,We Had An Excellent Time Thankyou,,,,,
,375,A Lovely Choice Of Venue For A Future Wedding.,,,,,
,378,That's All...,,,,,
,382,Reference Question 17 I Love Going Home So There Is No Reflection On The Hotel  I Am Never Sad To Leave Anywhere When I Am Going Home.,,,,,
,383,Just The Best Couple Of Days We Could Have Hoped For As A Couple - You Made Our Valentines Perfect!,,,,,
,389,The Best Hotel In The New Forest   If Only A Lift In The Reception,,,,,
,393,No,,,,,
,396,No,,,,,
,398,Beautiful Place Which Far Exceeded Expectations. Would Love To Return!,,,,,
,409,Regarding The Final Account  A Newspaper Was Added To My Account And Although It Was Delivered And I Read It (And Therefore Didn't Quibble Over The Cost) I Did Not Ask For It.
,,,,,
,413,When We Arrived We Parked In A Car Park Which Seemed To Lead Us Into The Hotel By A Back Door And We Had Quite A Long Walk To The Reception.  I Made Sure We Went Out Of The Main Door At Least Once So That We Could Feel Important And Not Like A Tradesman Who Had To Come In The Back Way.  I Don't Know How This Could Be Improved Upon But I Did Feel That It Was Not Very Nice To See The Hotel From The Back On Arrival - Perhaps Some Signs Outside Showing Folk How To Arrive At The Front Door?,,,,,
,414,My Sister And I  Both Fit And Well On Arrival At Careys  Have Both Experienced Infections The Day After Returning Home  Me A Stomach Bug  Which I Am Still Suffering From Today And My Sister A Throat Infection.  My Doctor Suggested I Let You Know About This As A Matter Of Courtesy. ,,,,,
,420,Loved The House And The Comfortable Bed.,,,,,
,425,Our Bill Was Calculated Wrong  We Signed For Our Dinner Drinks In The Mannor And Didnt Examine The Bill But Realised The Next Morning It Was Very Expensive For One Bottle Of Wine - After Checking Three Glasses Of Wine We Haddnt Drunk Had Been Added To Our Bill And The Receptionist's Response Was 'Well You Signed For Them'. My Husband Had To Politely Ask Her To Check With A Member Of The Waiting Staff From The Night Before As We Haddnt Ordered Or Drunk Them!,,,,,
,426,We Will Be Back !,,,,,
,430,N/A,,,,,
,431,Thank You For Another Lovely Break Would Like To Try Two Nights Next Time,,,,,
,433,As You Can Tell We Love Staying At Carey's Manor And Hope To Return Very Soon.,,,,,
,443,I Would Like To Visit Again But Would Avoid Room 17 Because Of The Bathroom Facilities,,,,,
,449,The Only Negative Could Be The Dated Appearance Of The Corridors  But This Didn't Impact The Stay ,,,,,
,453,I Can't Emphasise Enough How Exceptionally Good The Staff Were.,,,,,
,454,Thanks,,,,,
,455,Open Some Windows And Turn The Heating Off On Warm Days,,,,,
,456,While The Bill Was Accurate It Was Difficult To Work Out In Advance From The Website How Much It Was Going To Cost. Maybe Because Of Vat. ,,,,,
,457,It's A Lovely Hotel  With Fabulous Staff Who Make One Feel Very Special.  We'll Definitely Come Back (Despite The Breakfast As Everything Else Is So Wonderful).,,,,,
,460,Excellent Service,,,,,
,463,Wishing To Come As Soon As Possible ,,,,,
,464,Final Balance Was Incorrect As The 15% Discount For Spa Treatments Was Not Taken Off. I Had To Point This Out. ,,,,,
,465,Looking Forward To Our Next Visit Hopefully July And December Already Booked,,,,,
,466,Well Done To The Team And We Look Forward To Staying Again ,,,,,
,468,If Some Of The Environment (Some Decor Looking Tired / Worn Etc) Matched The Customer Services  Then We Would Be More Certain To Stay Again.,,,,,
,472,Keep The French Bar Open All Day  Not Serving Food  But At Least Drinks.,,,,,
,475,This Stay Was Not As Good As Previously And The Receptionist Was Also Very Unprofessional In Telling Us How She Gets Extra Work As Others Do Not Action Things  In Fact She Did Nothing But Moan As We Checked Out  This Is Not Our Problem And Frankly Did Not Want To Hear About It.,,,,,
,477,It Was A Wonderful 2 Night Break For 6 Friends To Get Together  We Had A Lovely Stay And Would Come Again.,,,,,
,483,Would Love A Free Break / Discount For Next Year!,,,,,
,489,If I Have One Recommendation - Sunday Morning- A Man Whose Daughter Had Had Or Had Caused An Inappropriate Experience In The Spa Was Talking To A Manager And Later Also The Spa Director. He Was Not Quiet. This Should Have Been Dealt With In A Private Area Not In The Lounge By The Bar,,,,,
,491,Mixed Feelings. My Father Has Stayed With You A Few Times And Loves Careys. Perhaps It Was Just A  Slightly Off Day Or Two And Things Were Not Quite Up To Scratch. Top Marks Ot The Chef And Staff Though.

Thanks

Jo Davey,,,,,
,493,None,,,,,
,495,Thanks So Much To All The Hotel  Bar  Restaurant And Spa Staff - A Fantastic Weekend Which I Look Forward To Repeating.,,,,,
,496,I Don't Think There Should Be A Separate Charge For The Hydrotherapy Area If Not  On Spa Package. It Should Be Available To All - Just Put Your Prices Up A Fraction. ,,,,,
,502,The Hotel Is Dated And In Need Of Refurbishment,,,,,
,504,We Will Definitely Come Again,,,,,
,505,It Was Wonderful  We Will Be Back!!,,,,,
,508,I Think The Price Of The Hydro Area Being The Same Price For Visitors And Guests Was Not Acceptable ,,,,,
,510,Keep Doing What You Do. As Long As There Is An Affordable Room With A Bit Of A View And The Pricing Is Similar. The Spa And Use Of The Dance Studio For An Hour And The Thai Continues We Will Be Back For More. 

I Wish There Was Some Kind Of Loyalty Reward For People Who Return. We Have Been Four Times In About 5 Years. That May Not Be That Much Compared To Some People. However We Have Not Been To Any Other Hotel That Many Times  We Rarely Go Back More Than Once. It Would Be Nice If Our Return Custom Was Shown To Be Valued Or Maybe That Is Just Wishful Thinking. I Am Not Thinking Of Anything Big Just A Token Gesture To Feel Welcomed Back! A Free Soft Drink At The Bar Or A Welcome Back Card In The Room Or The Reception To Know We Have Been Before Rather Than Ask Us If We Have Ever Stayed Before......Probably Very Difficult To Know That. I Am Being Fussy!
Thankyou For Offering Real Mint Tea. I Am Unable To Drink Tea Or Coffee And Unlike Most Places You Offer Me Something I Can Drink.

Thanks To All The Hard Working Staff For Making Our Stay So Pleasurable. It Must Be Really Hard To Please Everyone.,,,,,
,516,We Appreciated The Excellent Standard By Your Staff.,,,,,
,520,It Was Lovely Thank You.,,,,,
,522,All The Little Touches For Easter Weekend Were Very Much Appreciated!,,,,,
,525,We Found The £100 Food Allowance Complicated When We Settled The Account   Being English We Settled The Account & Queried  Nothing ,,,,,
,528,No It Was All Excellent,,,,,
,534,I Was Expecting A Traditional Country House Hotel Yet This Was Not The Case.,,,,,
,536,You Are So Near Being 5 Star.
The Staff Are Will But Thing Go A Little A Wall At A Busy Weekend.
The Bed Linen And Robes Are Very Tatty.
The French Restaurant Is A Little Dated.
The Zen Restaurant Is The Most Talked About. Gentle Reminder To Hotel Residents About Booking Is Advisable During The Stay.
Also I Think If You Are Up Grading And Having Treatments In Spa You Should Be Automatically Allowed To Have Breakfast In The Zen.Like Spa Day Clients.
,,,,,
,537,I Would Actually Like A Partial Refund For Our Stay  We Spent £416 In Total For One Nights Stay And It Was Not At All Relaxing. The Website Is Misleading With Regards The Accommodation. On Check Out I Was Informed We Stayed In A Standard Room  Your Website Does Not State That And For £208 A Room Per Night I Would Not Expect Standard! I Am So Upset By The Whole Experience  A Friend Of Ours Was Over From New Zealand And We Decided I Stay Here As A Surprise For Her But It Wasn't As We Expected. ,,,,,
,544,I Will If I Get The Chance Mention On Trip Advisor That I Don't Feel It Is Value Foe Money At Present . Wait For The Refurbishment.,,,,,
,547,Looking Forward To Coming Back In The Future.,,,,,
,548,No,,,,,
,553,We Absolutely Loved Celebrating Our Engagement Here! We Don't Often 'Splash' Out And We Felt That The Time We Had At The Hotel Was Worth Every Penny. We Have Recommended It To Everyone And Are Saving To Come Again But This Time For 2 Nights!! ,,,,,
,555,No,,,,,
,556,Thank You For Making Our Stay So Enjoyable.,,,,,
,558,The Wife Loved The Little Box Of Chocolates And Card Wishing Her Happy Birthday!,,,,,
,564,Would Love To Come Again And Have Brought Home Brochures To Give To Friends. ,,,,,
,566,What Rate Can You Offer For A Repeat Stay With You And Do I Book Direct With You?,,,,,
,568,No.,,,,,
,573,None I Can Think Of ,,,,,
,578,No,,,,,
,580,Just A Small Point - There Was No Beer On Tap Which Was Disappointing As My Boyfriend Enjoys A Pint Rather Than Bottled Beer. ,,,,,
,581,Couple Of Minor Negatives. Re Q19 - The Final Was Account Was £200 Pounds Out Due To The Hotels' Failure To Reduce Our Dining Bill By The Personal Allowances We Had Paid For Up Front. Sorry To Say That I Found This A Lack Of Attention To Detail. I Should Not Have To Tell You You're £200 Out!!

Re The Hotel Bar. We Were Surprised To Find It Only Sold Bottles And Cans Of Beer. Surely At Least A Couple Of Free Flow Taps Can't Be Beyond Setting Up  Can They? It Discouraged Us From Spending More Money With You!,,,,,
,582,As Already Stayed Careys Manor Holds A Special Place In Our Hearts And That Is Down To The Facilities  Location And Above All The Staff. We Are Never Disappointed When We Visit And Will Always Come Back. ,,,,,
,583,Our Expectations Of Careys Manor Exceeded Our Expectations But Unfortunately Our Expectations Of The French Bistro Fell Below. ,,,,,
,587,We Had A Wonderful Time And Would Like To Thank All Staff We Encountered. The Driver Of The Car To The Station  The Barman On Duty On Sat Night  The Male Receptionist  The Lovely Gentlemen Who Seemed To Be The Head Honcho In The Thai Restaurant And The Porter Who Took Us To Our Room On Arrival Explaining All The Hotel Information Again Just To Make Sure We Were Comfortable. Loved Every Minute.,,,,,
,591,Interested In Your New Year Package  But Apart From Ground Floor Rooms There Are No Disabled Facilities ,,,,,
,592,The Only Suggestion I Would Have Is To Provide More Sheltered/Indoors Parking Facilities For Bicycles.,,,,,
,595,No,,,,,
,599,I'll Be Back!!,,,,,
,602,Chocolates In My Room And Handwritten Note Was Lovely,,,,,
,603,No,,,,,
,610,Lovely Hotel And Wonderful Spa Facilities  Hopefully We Will Be Able To Stay Again Soon,,,,,
,613,Sadly A Bottle Of Champagne Was Charged To Our Room That We Didn't Have  However It Was Removed When We Challenged It,,,,,
,619,Great Hotel Genuine Staff With Great Manners And Professionalism,,,,,
,625,It Was Really Enjoyable But Given The Price Is A One Off Treat Not Regular Occurrence.,,,,,
,626,Again  The Only Real Criticism Is The Beer Prices. Like Most People I Do Not Mind Paying For Well Made Cocktails And Good Wine But £6 For A Can Of Guinness Is Ridiculous.,,,,,
,627,Thank You For Making Our Stay For Our Wedding Anniversary A Special One  Plus The Flowers And Card In Our Room Where Exceptional.

We Will Be Back In The Near Future.,,,,,
,634,Keep Up The Fantastic Standards That You Have Achieved ,,,,,
,636,The Breakfast Is Brilliant!,,,,,
,640,We Will Be Back. ,,,,,
,641,As Extremely Busy Farmers It Is Very Difficult For Us To Get Away We Don't Ever Have 'Holidays' So A Night Away At Careys And A Massage Is Our Special Treat For Ourselves And The Only Way To Have 'A Day Off' As We Have To Get On The Ferry  I Know That Sounds Quite Sad But Hey Thats Farming Life!!,,,,,
,650,We Always Love Coming To Carey's Manor. We Had Our Civil Partnership Ceremony And Celebration There 5 Years Ago And We've Been Coming Back Frequently Ever Since. I'd Say Its One Of My Favourite Hotels In The World. ,,,,,
,657,No,,,,,
,658,We Will Hope To Rreturn,,,,,
,660,Eve Menu In Manor House Spare And Meat Of A Poor Standard,,,,,
,661,Thank You For Another Great Stay. ,,,,,
,665,An Earlier Checkin Time Would Be Better,,,,,
,668,N/A,,,,,
,670,I Saved For Some Time To Afford A Special Weekend For My Daughter Who Is Getting Married In August. We Hope To Treat Her And Her New Husband To A Weekend Honeymoon Stay Later This Year And Would Welcome News Of Any Special Offers You Have That Might Be Suitable. I Have A Wide Circle Of Friends Through My Job And My Large Church And Will Happily Recommend You When The Opportunity Arises. Thank You For Helping To Make Our Stay A Very Pleasurable One. ,,,,,
,673,We Are Hoping To Be Able To Visit Again In The Future,,,,,
,675,We Didn't Want To Leave!!! :.(,,,,,
,677,Thanks,,,,,
,683,Cannot Wait To Return  Would Thoroughly Recommend A Stay At Your Hotel. And The Lovely Weather Was The Icing On The Cake,,,,,
,684,When I Arrived They Gave Us The Wrong Room  So They Upgraded Us .. They Told Us It Would Be Free Of Charge. The First Night Was £159 But They Charged Us £208 For The Second Night. My Husband Paid The Bill And Wasn't Aware Of The Price. It Was Me That Booked It. So We Have Been Overcharged.! I Would Appreciate It If You Could Send Me The Difference.,,,,,
,688,Cooked Breakfast Was Not Hot  Just Luke Warm So Very Disappointing.  Bacon Had Been Overcooked And Was Very Dry  Fried Eggs Were Rubbery On The Bottom Yet Not Cooked Enough On Top Due To Being Kept Luke Warm In A Warmer.  Very Disappointed With The Hot Items From The Breakfast. Would Have Been Nicer If Cooked To Order Especially The Eggs. ,,,,,
,689,I Do Have To Say That The Main Hotel Bar (Next To The Fine Dining Restaurant) Was Horribly Overpriced For What Was  In Effect  A Bottle Bar  1 Beer And One Jameson's And Coke Was £12.50 - With The Bottled Beer Being £5.50 I Believe. No Local Draft Beers? 

The French Restaurant Was Far More Reasonable On Price And It Would Make Sense For Drinks To Be Priced The Same Across The Establishment.


,,,,,
,690,Will Definitely Be Back And Will Recommend To Friends  But Will Unfortunately Have To Avoid The Zen Garden ,,,,,
,692,We Were Made To Wait For Getting On For 10 Mins To Settle Account. Not Acceptable.,,,,,
,694,No,,,,,
,700,The Back Ground Music In The Bar In The Evenings Was The Same On Each Occasion - Dave Brubeck
The Back Ground Music In The Breakfast Room Was Loud Hip Hop Music And Not Suitable For This Time Of Day
We Did Ask That The Speaker Situated Near Our Table To Be Moved Due To The Noise.,,,,,
,702,Generally A Disappointing Stay For The Overall Cost. ,,,,,
,705,Well Done!,,,,,
,708,Being Charged £1 On Checkout For A Morning Newspaper When Room Cost £200+ Was Poor....

,,,,,
,712,Wonderful Treat. Would Love To Return One Day!,,,,,
,716,Garlic Sausages For Breakfast? Considering The Amount Being Returned Half Eaten  And Think Other Guests Thought The Same As Me In That They Were Not A Breakfast Sausage. ,,,,,
,718,No,,,,,
,720,Overall A Very Disappointing Experience  As We Under The Impression For The Price Paid That It Would Be Tip Top,,,,,
,723,We Asked For  Assistance With Taxis Were Given Amounts We Would Pay   They Were More Expensive Then We Got Told    This Happenned 3 Times     Was Told On Booking We Could Be Assisted With Conceirge Service At Least To The Station   This We Were Then Told No When At Hotel   No One I Feel Went The Extra Mile Best Service Was In The Zen Restaurant And The Bar Staff   We Paid Out A  Lot More Due To Being Told The Wrong Amount And Cost Of A Lot Of Things    Our Trip Was Spoilt Due To This And Also To Being Out Of Money On The Last Day Not Then Being Able To Have A Spa Treatment This Was A Treat Before My Frineds Wedidng In  Sep Very Disapponinting  ,,,,,
,724,Thank You For A Wonderful Stay.   We'll See You Again.,,,,,
,733,Thank You For Asking!,,,,,
,734,Yes  And This Sadly Did Affect Our Stay And I Think This Is Something That Needs Attention In The Future.  During Our Stay You Had A Wedding On.  When We Were Waiting For Our Taxi In Reception There Were So Many People Congretated There That We Found It Necessary To Go Outside  However As It Was Raining We Stayed At The Top Of The Steps  Under Cover.  The Steps Were Literally Littered With Wedding Guests Smoking  Drinking And Swearing And This Wasn't Even 7Pm.  It Was A Most Unpleasant 10 Minute Wait  So Much So That On Our Return We Asked The Taxi To Drop Us Round The Side So We Didn't Have To Run The Gauntlet Of Even More Smoking Wedding Guests Who Most Likely Would Be Totally Drunk By Then.  I Feel That The Entrance To A 4 Star Hotel Should Be Kept Clear Of Smokers - It Really Isn't A Good Image For Hotel Guests To Be Faced With Upon Arrival Or Departure.  In My View  No Smoking Signs Should Be Put Up On This Area To Discourage This Kind Of Throng.  It Certainly Put A Dampener On Our Stay.  Sarah & Paul Bew,,,,,
,735,Thank You To Everyone  It Was A Busy Weekend But You Wouldnt Have Known It. The Staff Were Calm  Friendly And Informative. They Made Our Weekend Even More Relaxing. ,,,,,
,739,Keep Up The Good Work  We Hope To Return In The Future,,,,,
,744,None.,,,,,
,745,Generally A Very Beautiful And Well Thought Out Hotel. ,,,,,
,746,I Will Definitely Be Back!,,,,,
,747,We Will Return  To Our Favourite Hotel.  We Have Tried Quite A Few And Carey's Always Comes Out On Top,,,,,
,749,Room Service Prompt At Bringing Fresh Milk For Tea,,,,,
,752,I Always Think At Senspa That It's Such A Shame You Have No Outside Spa Facilities. This Would Have Been The Icing On The Cake And Is One Of The Reasons We Sometimes Opt To Go To A Different Spa Than Senspa  Particularly During The Summer Months. Most Spas Have Something Such As Some Sun-Loungers And Maybe A Hot Tub  Even If They Have No Space For Much More. 
Our Garden Room Was Very Convenient For The Spa  Particularly In The Light Of Our Walking Difficulties. View Was Stunning - Shame It Was Cold And Wet All The Time And We Couldn't Sit On Our Patio.
In Spite Of All The Comments I Have Made  In Most Respects We Had A Very Good Time. Took You At Your Word That You'd Rather Know Where You Fell A Little Short On The Idea Rather Than Only Get The Compliments..









































































































































































































































































































































































View From Our Garden Room Was Stunning And Very Handy For The Spa  Particularly Given Our Walking Difficulties- We Only Wishe3d The Weather Was Nice Enough For Us To Sit On The Patio.
Only Want To Add That In Spite Of The Number Of Criticisms I Have Just Made  Overall We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay. I Took You At Your Word That You'd Rather Know If You Fell Short In Any Aspects.






















































































,,,,,
,755,Thinking About It Afterwards I Was Not Convinced I Had Been Charged Correctly For The Restuarant Bills. We Had Booked On A Dinner  Bed And Breakfast Basis And I Settled The Account On Departure. Somewhat Stupidly I Destroyed The Invoice Before Checking It In More Detail. However  In Hindsight  I Felt We Had Been Charged An Excessive Amount Above Our £40/Dinner Allowance. This Will Teach Me To Check More Carefully In Future!,,,,,
,759,I Have Visited Before And Both Visits Have Been Excellent,,,,,
,763,Great Team All Round .. ,,,,,
,765,Overall Excellent  Keep Up The Good Work  We Look Forward To Our Next Visit,,,,,
,767,Thank You  Can't Wait For My Next Visit! I Wonder Was It Serendipity Or Fantastic Customer Service And Attention To Detail That Resulted In Dairy And Gluten Free Biscuits Being Left In Our Room? ,,,,,
,774,Duty Manager And Reception Staff Responded To Our Complaint Politely And I Feel Sure It Will Be Investigated And Resolved.,,,,,
,775,Congratulations On Your Service Level For Friendliness  Being Helpful  Attentive And Welcoming While Maintaining A Professional And Efficient Business.,,,,,
,779,You Have Some Great Staff  At Reception  In The Main Restaurant And Spa And It Was A Joy To Be Treated Well. It Makes Such A Change To Have Such Great Service Where You Really Feel Valued.,,,,,
,782,No,,,,,
,786,We Were Very Impressed And Had A Fantastic Experience. Can't Wait To Visit Again.,,,,,
,788,No.,,,,,
,790,Previously Stayed And Dined In The Manor Restaurant So Thought We'd Try The French Restaurant But Unfortunately Disappointed  Very Slow Service  Starter Had To Be Sent Back And Main Course Was Average. Disappointing Considering The Manor Was Brilliant ,,,,,
,796,This Was Our Return Visit After Sixteen Years  Having Married At The Manor In May 1998. I Found The Experience Favourable  Though My Wife Has A Few Ideas You May Wish To Take Into Account.,,,,,
,797,Breakfast:  Choosing Cereals  Fruit Etc.From The Breakfast Bar Is Acceptable  But For A Hotel Of Your Status  I Consider That Service To The Table For The Cooked Selection Should Not Require To Be Specifically Requested.We Experienced Both Mushrooms And Tomatoes Had Run Out  Although These Were Subsequently Delivered To The Table.,,,,,
,799,Thankyou For A Lovely Stay!,,,,,
,801,The Gardens Are Beautiful And It Was Really Pleasant To Be Able To Enjoy Them In Descent Furniture (No Plastic Chairs!).,,,,,
,803,We Had A Lovely Time And Appreciated The Congratulatory Balloon And Chocolates That Were In Our Room On Arrival.  Thank You.,,,,,
,818,Yes Perhaps You Could Have A Large Sign In The Swimming Pool To Tell People They  Must Have A Shower Before  Entering  The Pool We Noticed Some People Not Showering Before Entering The Pool Not Good,,,,,
,821,Keep The Standards High,,,,,
,822,We Really Enjoyed The Stay And Felt Very Comfortable At The Hotel.  The Breakfast Was Great.  The Staff Were The Icing On The Cake. ,,,,,
,826,Just To Say Thank You For A Lovely Time And We Hope To Return Next Year For Our Birthdays Again!,,,,,
,830,Although A Jersey Channel Island Resident I Try To Come To Careys Manor At Least Once Every Year ,,,,,
,833,No,,,,,
,841,Whilst We Were In 'Basic' Room And No Upgrade I Was Disappointed In Room Standard Of Knightwood Room Compared To Previous Room When Having Paid Extra To Upgrade. Changing Rooms In Spa Were Very Hot  Only 1 Fan Provided Despite Me Asking Spa Staff For Another Fan. However All Staff Were Helpful And Polite. Food Good  Spa Good.,,,,,
,842,No,,,,,
,843,We Will Be Back!,,,,,
,845,A Huge Thank You To Dawn In Reservations For Putting The Whole Weekend Together. This Was To Celebrate My 40Th And She Had Arranged For A Beautiful Bouquet Of Flowers In My Room. The Room Was Huge As She Promised. She Completely Met My Needs And Exceeded Them. ,,,,,
,846,None,,,,,
,847,In 20 Above I Put Met As I Always Have Very High Expectations Of Carey's Manor And These Were All Met.  We Had Our Honeymoon In Carey's Manor In 1984 And Have Come Back (I Think This Was Our 14Th Time) Have Seen All The Changes Over The Years  When We First Came There Was Only The Manor House Accommodation So There Have Been Vast Developments And Improvements Over The Years.  Nice To See A Few Staff Still Working There Since 1984.  If We Lived A Bit Nearer  We Would Return A Lot More.,,,,,
,849,For The Amount You Pay  The Room Did Not Live Up To Expectations.,,,,,
,850,We Have Spent Several Years Visiting The New Forest And Struggled To Find Anywhere We Would Like To Return To. We Feel We Have Now Found The Gem We Have Been Seeking And Will Most Certainly Be Returning.,,,,,
,852,It Was A Lovely Touch To Receive The Postcard From Thomas In Our Room.,,,,,
,859,As I Have Mentioned Already  Redecorate The Dining Room  Improve The Lighting  Especially At Breakfast As It Is So Gloomy.  Change The Dining Tables.  Consider Where And What Level Of Disabled Parking Is Available.
Offer Lighter Dinners Rather Than 3 Courses.  On Previous Visits We Have Visited The French Restaurant  But Didn't Bother This Year As We Found It Disappointing In The Past.  As I Said I Had Planned To Bring A Group For The Christmas Party Prior To Christmas But Am Unsure Now  Which Is A Shame As Have Been A Few Times In The Past And Had A Great Time.  I Feel That Careys Has Gone Down  It Doesn't Feel As Luxurious As It Used To Do! ,,,,,
,863,Hotel Over Promised On The Website And Under Delivers In Reality,,,,,
,864,Would Recommend To All Guests To Hire A Bike And Explore The Forest - Wonderful !,,,,,
,865,Our Stay Was A Birthday Treat For My Wife's 50Th. We Had The Most Wonderful Time And Will Certainly Be Coming Back. I Would Like To Thank All At Careys For Making It So Special. Thank You. ,,,,,
,866,Thank You For All That You Did.  My Husband Enjoyed His 60Th Birthday And We Would Like To Return.  Many Thanks Once Again.,,,,,
,868,We Will Visit The Spa Again For A Spa Day But Never For A Spa Weekend. ,,,,,
,869,Great Hotel In A Great Location!,,,,,
,874,Thanks For A Wonderful Stay,,,,,
,877,No,,,,,
,889,No Just A Lovely Break For My Husbands Birthday!,,,,,
,890,I Though The The Bar/Lounge/Manor Restaurant Area Was Looking Bit Tired And Could Be Upgraded To Make Them Warmer And More Inviting. The Barman Did Mention An Upgrade Would Be Taking Place In The Autumn  So I Look Forward To Seeing The Results Of That!,,,,,
,891,Can't Wait To Return,,,,,
,892,No,,,,,
,898,No,,,,,
,901,Check The Shower Heads ,,,,,
,907,Overall My Experience Was Very Positive. I Really Enjoyed My Stay.,,,,,
,908,Can't Wait To Return,,,,,
,913,Minor Point But I Was Surprised That No Draught Beer Is Available In The Hotel,,,,,
,914,We Have Collected Many Loyalty Cards Over The Years But Lost Them All. We Have Always Intended To Send My In Laws Who Always Look After The Children For A Midweek Night. Can We Backdate The Loyalty Card To Give Them A Nihjt Away Please?,,,,,
,918,No,,,,,
,920,I Feel That I've Said It All. The Prices I'm Afraid Don't Reflect The Luxuriousness.,,,,,
,921,We Will Return & Make Sure We Book Spa Treatments Beforehand,,,,,
,927,The Bill Was Wrong But This Was Quickly Corrected. Staff Were Extremely Accommodating When My Mother Decided To Change The Package She Had Booked.,,,,,
,930,Not The Best Stay. Bottle Of Preseco Not In Room On First Night As Promised  I Had To Ask Three Different People At Different Times On The Second Day Until Someone Delivered Bottle To Room. I Expected This To Be Dealt With With Only One Request  Not Three.

 Breakfast On The First Morning. Ordered A Vegetarian Breakfast  Which Took Nearly 30Mins To Arrive  Had To Ask Three People Where It Was And Was Assured It Was On It Way. I Had Finished My Breakfast And Sat Waiting In An Emptying Breakfast Room As My Wife Became More Agitated At The Lack Of Her Breakfast And Service.

Despite Booking Over The Phone And 'Paying' For My First Night At The Time  I Was Shocked To See A Full Bill On Check-Out  Which Included The First Night. I Was Informed That This Sometimes Happens And That If I Went Away And Checked My Bank And I Had Been Charged Twice That I Could Call Up And Get A Refund.

Overall  What Was Supposed To Be A Luxurious And Relaxing Break Was Not What I Expected For The Price I Paid I Expected A Much Better Overall Experience.

I Have Had To Put My Wife Off Posting Her Review On Trip-Advisor Until I Have Given You The Chance To Reply To My Concerns.

,,,,,
,931,I Feel The Stay Was Fantastic Although Overpriced.,,,,,
,933,No,,,,,
,937,Thank You So Much For Making My Special Birthday  Extra Special. ,,,,,
,943,A Great Friendly Hotel Which Makes A Holiday.,,,,,
,945,Very Enjoyable Stay,,,,,
,948,We Have Already Recommended You To Our Friends And Colleagues  Who Will Be Visiting You.
We Shall Certainly Be Returning To Stay For A Longer Period This Time  In Order To Fully Enjoy The Facilities In A More Relaxed Manor.,,,,,
,954,Nope  Thanks For Having Me.

Hopefully See You Very Soon.

Danielle Couch,,,,,
,958,Some Of The Corridors Need A Good Clean And Walls Need Painting ,,,,,
,959,The Friendliness And Helpfulness Of Your Staff  With The Exception Of The Senspa Staff  Makes Your Hotel Far Superior To Any Others That I Have Ever Stayed In.  Thank You Very Much For A Lovely Stay.,,,,,
,961,A Corporate   Not Holiday Experience. Efficient  Perhaps But Is It Really Necessary To Get One To Pay In Advance? This Suggests Either Distrust Of The Customer  Or That The Hotel Has In The Past Been The Victim Of Fraud Which Calls Into Question The Type Of Clientele It Expects. I Found It Overpriced  But Either I Was Getting A Poor Rate Or I Am Wrong Because The Hotel Was Full. Breakfast Certainly Seriously Overpriced.,,,,,
,966,Room Service Was Slightly Slow,,,,,
,969,N/A,,,,,
,971,Personally We Thought The Hotel Was Very Tired Looking And In Our Opinion Does Not Warrant The High Nightly Rates  We Both Travel A Lot For Business And Have Stayed In Many Hotels Around The World.
,,,,,
,972,No,,,,,
,985,N/A,,,,,
,986,Overall The Hotel Is Overpriced For The Experience But The Staff Were Excellent ,,,,,
,987,Bill Put Right  No Problems There. Forgot To Mention Lunch In Spa Restaurant- Also Lovely. Smoothies Particularly. ,,,,,
,988,You Must Have Been Awarded Top 50 By Independent A Very Long Time Ago.,,,,,
,989,Thank You For Reaffirming My Faith In The Art Of Customer Service. I Thought It Was Dead But It Appears The Staff At Careys Manor Could Definitely Teach Other Establishments A Thing Or Three. ,,,,,
,991,As Above,,,,,
,994,We Had A Lovely Time.,,,,,
,999,Have You Considered Encouraging Your Guests To Return By Offering Them   Say  A Free Lunch For Two After And Dependent On Their Length Of Stay  This Way They May Return For The Meal And Later Book Further Accommodation And May Well Recommend To Friends. Have You Maybe Thought Of A Loyalty Card/System Which Could Encourage Guests To Return To Either Dine In Your Restaurants Or Dine And Stay.,,,,,
,1000,Thank You For Another Fabulous Stay. Look Forward To Returning Again Soon. ,,,,,
,1004,We Had A Wonderful Time. We Stayed At Carey's 10Yrs Ago & Returned For Our Anniversary. We Won't Be Leaving It So Long Till We Next Return,,,,,
,1010,A Wonderful Experience And One We Would Recommend To All Our Friends. ,,,,,
,1011,The Bill Was Very Inaccurate.  I Had Only One Treatment (A Massage - Lovely) But The Bill Had At Least Two Other Treatments On It  Amounting To At Least An Additional £150.  This Was Corrected Immediately . However  It Is A Little Disconcerting And One Would Hope That The Staff Chased This Up To See If People Were Giving Incorrect Room Numbers..Maybe This System Needs Reviewing.  However  Overall A Lovely Stay And We Will Be Coming Again.,,,,,
,1014,Excellent Stay Will Be Back Next Year  Comments Put On Trip Advisor As Well.,,,,,
,1019,The Gardens Were Very Beautiful And Enjoyable.  We Met The Gardener Going About His Work And He Was Very Pleasant Too.,,,,,
,1020,For My Wife And I  The Best Part Of Our Stay Was The Treatments. The Rest Of The Stay Was Nice But No Better Than Other Hotels We Have Stayed At. In Future  We Will Probably Not Stay Overnight And Just Have A Day Spa And Treatment.,,,,,
,1023,Checkout Took A Long Time ,,,,,
,1031,I Always Expect To Get What I Pay For. When I Get More I'm Delighted. I Had A Delightful Stay 😊,,,,,
,1038, Remembering My Husband Had Mentioned We Were Celebrating Our 10Th Wedding Anniversary When Booking Was A Very Personal Touch. The Personal Welcome Back Card With Balloon And Chocolates Was Very Kind And A Lovely  Unexpected Surprise - Thank You.,,,,,
,1039,We Raised Our Complaint Regarding Dietary Requirements With The Duty Manager Who Stated That We Could Have Checked Earlier  And As A Goodwill Gesture Took A Bottle Of Prosseco Off Our Bill. We Appreciated The Gesture  However We Feel It Should Not Be Our Responsibility To Follow Up On Our Requests.,,,,,
,1046,Will Be Back Soon For More Pampering. ,,,,,
,1053,Thankyou For A Lovely Break!,,,,,
,1055,Overpriced And Too Close To A Basic 3 Star Hotel With A Spa.

Chose Not To Complain At The Time  Key Reason For Visiting Was To Relax With My Wife And Any Dialogue Would Have Been Counterproductive.,,,,,
,1056,Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay  A Great Experience.,,,,,
,1062,It Was Such A Shame That Our Experience Was Bad- We Had Been Recommended By Friends And Were Looking Forward To A Romantic Evening Away- We Do Not Have Long Holidays At Work And Try To Ensure Good Accommodation And Service When We Book Our Short Breaks- This Fell Well Below Our Expectation Unfortunately ,,,,,
,1068,Bill Was Incorrect At End My Husband Had To Go Back Twice To Rectify,,,,,
,1071,See You In October And We Are Considering Coming New Year's Eve As Well ,,,,,
,1074,We Feel Very Sad To Have Lost Your Hotel As Part Of Our Escape Plan As We Have Visited It Together & With Friends - This Time Was Special As It Was Our 7Th Wedding Anniversary.
I Don't Know What Your Policies Are But When Your Senior Staff Can See The Problem For Themselves (Dirt  Dust  Broken Glass / Plastic) And Acknowledge It Is Not Acceptable Offering Guests A Bottle Of Champagne / Fizzy Wine On Their Next Visit It's Almost Insulting & Presumptuous.  ,,,,,
,1075,I Really Appreciate The Chocolates Welcoming Me Back!  It's A Lovely Touch And Makes Me Feel Special.  Thank You.,,,,,
,1076,Some Areas Of The Main Areas Of The Hotel Are Looking Tired & Décor Could Be Improved.  Lighter & Brighter.

The Gravel Car Park Is Not Easy To Drag A Suitcase & The Distance From Reception On Arrival.,,,,,
,1078,Won't Be Rushing Back  Unless There Are Some Improvements   Nice Setting  Spa Is Very Good.  Rooms Are Tired  The Manor Restaurant Needs A Refurb And The Staff Need Training. ,,,,,
,1080,Would Like To Be Kept Up To Date With Any Offers,,,,,
,1081,This Is A Truly Fabulous Place And We Feel Lucky To Live Only An Hour Away.  Roll On The Next Visit!  With Many Thanks To Everyone For Making It Such A Special Weekend.,,,,,
,1082,Thank You Once Again,,,,,
,1083,Our Final Account Was Incorrect By Roughly £80.  We Booked A Number Of Treatments And Our Discount For This Was Not Applied To Our Final Account.  We Queried This And It Was Resolved But Took A Little While Longer Than We Expected.  It Was Unclear When Our Treatments Were Booked If The Discounted Rate Would Be Shown On Our Bill That We Sign  Or If It Would Be Applied On Our Final Account.  This Should Be Clarified To Guests When They Arrive.,,,,,
,1085,Overall We Had A Really Lovely Time At The Spa And Hotel And Staff Were Lovely,,,,,
,1086,We Were Disappointed With Breakfast. Items Running Out  Eggs Stone Cold As The Burner Had Gone Out Unnoticed  Tables Not Cleared As We Went Along. Our Tea Was Even Put On An Unoccupied Table  Much To Our Bemusement. Just Little Things...,,,,,
,1089,Breakfast In Bed Orders Delivered Incorrectly. ,,,,,
,1090,I Was Very Pleased With How You Handled A Large Business Group For 2 Of The Nights We Were There Whilst Still Looking After The 'Normal' Guests. I Was Fearful They Would Take Over The Hotel Which Was A Bit Of An Issue Around The Pool With Some Loud Behaviour But Other Than That They Were Kept Quite Separate But Discreetly Which Was Very Impressive.,,,,,
,1095,We Felt That Some Of The Decorations Were A Little Tired And That The Room We Had Could Do With Decorating/Freshening Up. The Bathroom Could Also Do With Some Attention.,,,,,
,1098,Look Forward To Returning In The Future,,,,,
,1104,Will Definatly Return   Have Used Montagues Arms And Love Both Hotels,,,,,
,1110,Just A Big Thank For A Lovely Time,,,,,
,1115,Cannot Wait For Another Visit!,,,,,
,1116,So Lovely To Actually Want To Stay At A Hotel For Longer!,,,,,
,1132,Very Expensive For What It Was,,,,,
,1142,I Have My Own Window Cleaning Business And If Ever The Contract Became Available Would Love To Come And Price It Up :) Sorry Probably Not What Your Looking For But You Dont Ask!?! I Can Provide Good Reference ,,,,,
,1144,The Accommodation Was Quite Expensive  However That Reflects The Month,,,,,
,1145,See Above,,,,,
,1154,A Map Showing How To Reach Various Restaurants Internally Would Be Useful. ,,,,,
,1156,Taking A Look At The Breakfast As It Was At Such A Low Standard Compared To The Dinner And The Rest Of Our Stay.,,,,,
,1157,Absolutely Diabolical. You Ought To Be Ashamed Of The Level Of Service Provided.,,,,,
,1158,The Evening Meal Was Prepaid As Part Of The Booking Yet At Checkout  They Wanted To Charge For The Meals As Extras. This Was Rectified Quickly.
As A Family  We Have Always Found The Breakfast To Be Of Exceptional Quality. I Am Not Sure If It Was Due To This Stay Being Midweek  But The Breakfast Was Not To The Usual Standard With The Bacon Being Particularly Disappointing (Overcooked And Greasy),,,,,
,1165,Mini Bar In The Room Would Be A Nice Touch.
Maybe A Couple Of Ice Machines Within The Public Areas  Rather Than Keep Bothering The Room Service Team.,,,,,
,1166,No,,,,,
,1170,We Always Love Our Time Here  It's The Place We Celebrate All Types Of Things As A Couple And Have Done For Many Many Years.  Fond Memories  Just Wish We Could Do It More Often....,,,,,
,1171,There Was A Lot Of Banging Doors At 6Am Which Woke Us Up.  We Ordered Breakfast In Our Room As We Have On Previous Visits  The Quality Of The Food Wasn't As Good As On Previous Visits.,,,,,
,1173,No,,,,,
,1179,Keep Up The Good Work,,,,,
,1195,The Only Complaint Was The Choice Of Background Music In The Main Hotel  Did Nothing To Help Me Relax ,,,,,
,1201,Thank You For The Overall Very Enjoyable Stay,,,,,
,1205,The Only Other Issue That Blighted The Stay (And Only Slightly  Really) Was That On The Saturday Night Of Our Stay (23Rd August) The Fire Alarm Went Off At Around Half Past Midnight.  It Sounded For About 15 Seconds And Obviously Jolted Us Awake.  I Went Outside The Room And Started To Walk Towards Reception To Find Out What Was Going On But It Seemed Evident That No-One Was Being Evacuated So Once The Alarm Stopped I Went Back To Bed.  No Explanation Was Given On Checkout As To What It Was (We Assume A False Alarm) But Obviously It Was Slightly Concerning At The Time.,,,,,
,1208,We Look Forward To Returning,,,,,
,1210,Thank You For A Delightful Short Break!,,,,,
,1212,A Very Pleasant Stay Made Exceptional By The Attentive And Friendly Staff.,,,,,
,1214,The Couple Who Were Checking Out At The Same Time As Us Were Refusing To Pay And Were Checking Out As The Noise Was Completely Unacceptable. This Must Have Been Noted By Other Guests As Well.,,,,,
,1216,Other Than The Earlier Comments About The Wedding Party  No.
Pleased To Hear That The Manor Restaurant Is Going To Be Re-Decorated.   Will Be Visiting Again Just Before Xmas So Looking Forward To Seeing The New Decor.,,,,,
,1217,?,,,,,
,1220,Thank You For A Lovely Stay.,,,,,
