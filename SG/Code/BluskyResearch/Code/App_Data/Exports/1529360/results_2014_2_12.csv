,----------------------,,,,,,
,1,The Hotel Was Pleasant Enough  Breakfast Service Was A Bit Muddled. The Main Point Was The Rooms Were So Hot  That It Was Uncomfortable  Even With The Heating Turned Off And The Windows Open - It Was November,,,,,
,2,It Was A Pleasant Stay  Breakfast Service Was A Bit Shambolic And The Rooms Were Far Too Hot  Even With The Heating Turned Off And Windows Open In November. Made For An Hot Night's Sleep,,,,,
,3,The Staff Were Extremely Freindly And Helpful  The Room Was Very Clean And Well Equipped And The Dining Experience Was Excellent,,,,,
,4,We Enjoyed Our Experience Of Staying At The Hotel. However We Had Dinner On The 24Th November And We Had To Peruse The Wiatress To Come And Take Our Order. We Had Been Given The Menus As Soon As We Arrived And As We Waited A Long Time We Thought That She Had Forgotten.  Our Party Of Four All Enjoyed Their Meals.,,,,,
,5,It Was Excellent  Loved How Spacious And Roomy The Hotel Was   All The Staff Were Very Friendly ( Mostly Polish I Think ) The Room Was Perfect  Except For One Thing  The Towel Rail In The Bathrroom Was Constantly On And Was Very Hot  This Made It Very Warm And Stuffy In The Bedroom And Was Difficult To Get To Sleep  We Had To Leave The Windows Open All Night As It Was So Hot In The Room. Room 314 Which I Stayed In Was 2 Single Beds Pushed Together Which Made A Gap Right Down The Middle Of The Bed   But Apart From That Everything Else Was Perfect  We Had Evening Meal And Breakfast And It Was An Excellent Standard  And I Will Be Recommending The Hotel To Family And Friends For Sure.,,,,,
,6,Having Stayed At Another 4 Star Hotel Not To Far From The Imperial I Can Say Without Reservation That The Imperial Was Head And Shoulders Above That Experience. The Reception Staff Were Professional And Warm  The Dining Staff Were Attentive Without Being Intrusive. The Room Was Absolutely Superb  Apart From A Very Minor Detail Noted On The Feedback Card. When Visiting Llandudno In The Future We Will Never Need To Search For Accomodation Again  Imperial Hotel Everytime.,,,,,
,7,Had A Great Time  Room And Food (Breakfast And Dinner) Were Perfect. Stunning Hotel Throughout (Stopped In Standard  Superior And Superior Front Facing Rooms Previously). Waiters At Breakfast Were Very Attentive.  Only Problems Were A Slightly Frosty Reception  Something We Have Noticed In The Past. Also  The Spa Pool Was Not Open Which Was A Disappointment For Us Both.  We Look Forward To Visiting The Imperial Again Next Year,,,,,
,8,Great Facilities  Great Cleanliness In Bathroom  Great Service  Great Food  Great View.  Lovely Hotel And Good 24Hr Vacation!  Only Slight Moan Is That The Radiators In The Front Of The Hotel (Overlooking Sea) Are On Top Temperature Which Is Fair Enough For The Elderly But Not Good For A Middle-Aged Woman!  Thanks Very Much To You All And See You Again Soon.,,,,,
,9,Fabulous!!!!,,,,,
,10,Relaxing.,,,,,
,11,Excellent: The Staff Are Always Pleasant And Obliging. We Always Stay At The Imperial Hotel When We Visit Llandudno.,,,,,
,12,Relaxed Atmosphere  Friendly And Very Helpful Staff.  It Is A Pleasure To Stay At The Imperial Hotel.  Clean Rooms And Great Food.,,,,,
,13,Stay Was Fine Just Think Your Prices Are Extortianate. We Booked In At Reception And Was Told Our Superior Room Would Be On The Side Or Back Of The Hotel  Because We Booked With Laterooms !!!! We Paid £160 For The Room  Which They Said Should Have Been £190.Receptionist Told Me For An Extra £30 We Could Have Sea View. I Paid This Amount Under Duress But After Having Seen Back Of Hotel Didnt Fancy It At All. Stay Was As I Previousley Said Ok But For That Amount Of Money I Expected A Lot More Of The Room. Could Have Had Standard For A Lot Cheaper And Only Diffrence Is Size Of Room And Trouser Press ??? Personally I Think Prices Should Br Reviewed Not That You Will And It Will Not Gwt Me The Extra Back I Had To Pay For Sea View. Im Sure Under The Circumstances Room Could Have Beenchanged Free Of Charge As It Was Empty Anyway !!!!! Dissapointed......,,,,,
,14,I Had A Lovely Time From Start To Finish And The Food In The Evening And Morning Were Lovely! ,,,,,
,15,Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,16,Excellant,,,,,
,17,Warm  Welcoming But Not In Your Face.,,,,,
,18,Relaxing  Positive Experience.,,,,,
,19,Drink Price A Little High. Had To Drink Wine That Was Left Off The Old Menu New Stock Should Have Been There. ,,,,,
,20,We Brought My Mother As A Guest This Being Her First Experience Of Your Hotel. We Were Very Impressed With Our Stay With My Mother Singling Out The Way In Which She Was Dealt With By All Of The Staff Members Who We Came Into Contact With. A Very Relaxing Stay Which We All Enjoyed.,,,,,
,21,Friendly  Comfortable  Very Good Food.,,,,,
,22,Top Hotel Highly Recommended,,,,,
,24,Excellent - Room Had "Lounge" Area We Used A Lot With Friends. Staff Very Friendly And Helpful,,,,,
,25,The Hotel Is Very Good And The Food Is Excellent.I Feel The Only Thing Missing Is Some Nightly Entertainment.,,,,,
,26,Very Good  As Expected  As Previous Visits  Food & Service Excellent  As Is Normally The Case ,,,,,
,27,I Very Relaxing And Enjoyable Stay  Thank You So Much.,,,,,
,28,A Pleasant And Relaxing Stay With Excellent Facilities,,,,,
,29,Very Enjoyable ,,,,,
,30,We Were Thrilled To Find  That After A Three Year Absence  The Imperial Had Maintained Its Extremely High Standards. We Were Glad We Came Back! We Will Come Again.,,,,,
,32,Fairly Disappointing Sadly.  Although Food Was V Good The Room Had Not Been Adequately Prepared.  I Am Shortly To Return To The Area On Business But Will Explore Alternative Accommodation  ,,,,,
,33,Very Comfortable; Excellent Food; Loved Having Breakfast And Dinner On The Veranda.,,,,,
,34,Very Pleasant,,,,,
,35,A Stay At The Imperial Is Always Relaxing And A Chance To Slow Down,,,,,
,36,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,37,Overall Our Experience Was That It Was Thoroughly Enjoyable Our Room Was Very Comfortable However On Arrival In The Room There Were Definitely Some Surfaces That Hadnt Been Cleaned With Evidence Of Sugar And Tea Stains  Dusty Shelves Otherwise Excellent. The Lounges Were Comfortable And Staff More Than Helpful.  ,,,,,
,38,Real Good Hotel   Room The Best     Food Great And Good Service From Joycelyn Just Need My Vat Invoice Emailed As Requested Can You Do This Today.  Ta Tom  Tom.Dunlop@Kubota.Com,,,,,
,40,We Had An Excellent Stay And Very Good Value For Money,,,,,
,41,A Great Relaxed Environment  Which Was Pleasurable.,,,,,
,42,Very Enjoyable ,,,,,
,43,Most Enjoyable Two Days,,,,,
,44,Good Service And Attention To Detail Meant Stress Free Stay And Meetings.,,,,,
,45,A Decent Experience. Staff Were Courteous And Helpful...There Were A Couple Of Issues...The Heating Didn't Work Initially But Was Resolved. I Didn't Master The Tv....Couldn't Get A Signal...Despite Following Instructions...But The Free Internet Allowed Me To Circumnavigate This Problem And Use My Ipad. The Second Night Of My Stay The Hotel Was Hosting Christmas Parties. As My Room Was 126 Which Appeared To Be Immediately Above The Function Room The Level Of Noise Was Excessive. Staff Were Very Accommodating And I Moved Rooms  But A Little Forethought Could Have Avoided The Need To Do This By Not Allocating Rooms Above The Function Room When Parties Are Being Hosted.,,,,,
,46,We Had A Lovely Break  The Hotel Was Very Accommodating Warm And Friendly Staff Very Polite And Always Helpful. The Food Was Good  .It Would Have Been Nice If There Had Been More Guests Around  Perhaps We Chose The Wrong Week.Having Said That We Had A Good Time And Look Forward To Returning.,,,,,
,47,Really Great - The Room Was Spacious The Kingsize Bed Nice & Comfortable - Far Better Than A Double. The Dining Was Excellent - Food Was Superb And Staff Friendly & Efficient. The Reception Staff Were Also Very Good - Willing & Helpful. A Happy Place To Stay.  ,,,,,
,49,We Have Visited The Hotel Many Times Over The Last 20 Years Or So.  It Is Comfortable And Cosy For A Large Hotel And We Always Enjoy Our Time There.,,,,,
,50,Another Enjoyable Stay At The Hotel. Excellent Bedroom & Decor Throughout The Hotel. Surprisingly  The Sunday Menu Is More To Our Liking Than The Ala Carte Menu - But An Excellent Breakfast.,,,,,
,52,Very Comfortable  Courteous And Professional,,,,,
,53,Well Looked After,,,,,
,54,Exceeded Our Expectations,,,,,
,55,Comfortable Stay  Excellent Food And Service  Helpful Professional Staff.,,,,,
,56,We Had A Lovely Stay At The Imperial Hotel  And Would Love To Stay Again.,,,,,
,59,All Staff Were Very Good In Particular Sara On Booking The Room,,,,,
,60,Wonderful  As Always - Friendly Welcome  Made To Feel "Special" - Always An Interest Shown In How We Are Enjoying Our Stay - Both In Terms Of The Hotel And Llandudno.  Nothing Is Ever Too Much Trouble - Staff Go To Lengths To Meet Any Requests.  Room Very Comfortable And High Standard Of Cleaning.  Meals All Excellent.  The Buffet Breakfast Is Exceptional!  Lunches And Dinners Very High Quality Fresh And Local Ingredients.  It Is Always So Relaxing And Pleasurable.  We Enjoy The Pool  Sauna And Steam Room - A Real Bonus.,,,,,
,62,A Most Enjoyable Stay.,,,,,
,64,Apart From A Few Niggles  Pretty Good.,,,,,
,66,Very Nice,,,,,
,67,Excellent Service Accommodation Facilitates And Food,,,,,
,68,Very Enjoyable As Expected. Conveniently Place  For Walking Around The Town And Promenade. Definitely The Best Value For Money In Llandudno,,,,,
,69,Excellent Food  Service And Ambiance. Entertainment On Xmas/Boxing Days Were Good.  Constructive Criticism--Room 418 Too Hot Even With Windows Open. No Entertainment On Tuesday And Wednesday Evenings After 8.45Pm.,,,,,
,71,A Very Happy And Enjoyable 3/4 Days Over The Recent Christmas- In Every Way.,,,,,
,72,Our Stay Again Was Very Good As Usual It Never Fails In Other Word Excellent.,,,,,
,73,We Enjoyed Our Stay But Noticed Difference In The Overall Experience From Our Two Earlier Visits Some 8 Years Ago. Food Was Good But Not To The Standard We Experienced In The Past. Entertainment - Not Great. Apparently Many More Guests This Time. ,,,,,
,74,Xmas Was A Memorable Experience In Every Way And The Staff Made Every Effort To Ensure Your Guests Enjoyed The Entertainments And The Superb Meals To The Full.,,,,,
,77,A Wonderful Christmas.,,,,,
,78,Very Enjoyable Christmas Break,,,,,
,79,As Expected For A 4* Hotel ,,,,,
,81,Pampered,,,,,
,82,Very Relaxing,,,,,
,83,First Class Friendly Staff Thats Makes The Hotel Special ,,,,,
,86,So Good That We Shall Definitely Return.,,,,,
,87,A Very Friendly Hotel Obviously Privately Owned And Where The Staff Are Anxious To Please In Every Way. Not Overly Intrusive And Sensitive To The Needs Of Guests To Be Quiet When They Want To Be And Yet Provide Plenty Of Activity For The Young And Old.,,,,,
,88,Up To A Good Standard  But Clearly Affected By The Large Parties Held In The Evenings. This Was To Be Expected  Given The Time Of Year  But If I Was One Of The Residents Moved Into The Lobby Room For Dinner I Would Not Have Been Happy. Having Said That  I Guess That It's Difficult To Balance The Needs Of Large Party Groups And Small Resident Groups. But That's Your Job ..... Isn't It? We Will Be Back To The Imperial  Just Not In December Again. We Had A Front And Side Facing Suite Which Was Very Good And Spacious  But There Was An Odd Mixture Of 13 And 15 Amp Sockets And Plugs Which Meant That Some Devices Could Not Be Plugged In Where Placed. Strange  But Being An Understanding Soul I Do Recognise How Old The Hotel Is And How Electric Circuits Evolve Over Time. The Staff Were All Excellent As Usual Which Is Probably The Main Reason Why We Return. We Stayed Twice In 2013 And Have Stayed Many Times Before That. Still The Best Large Hotel In Llandudno. Please Keep It Like That!! Many Thanks. ,,,,,
,90,Excellent In Almost Every Way.    Unfortunately We Live A Long Way Away So I Cannot Say Firmly That We'll Be Able To Come Again.  I Have Only Two Comments About Areas In Which You Could Improve - Please Polish The Ballroom Floor As It Is Impossible  To Dance On It.  Please Ensure That Emails Concerning Dietary Requirements Are Passed On To The Chef.,,,,,
,91,All Aspects Of Our Stay Fulfilled Our Expectations,,,,,
,92,As Always  We Had A Wonderful Christmas Break. Accommodation  Food  Festivities All Excellent As Usual. Once Again We Would Like To Thank The Staff For Their Smiling  Superb Service. Needless To Say  We Have Already Booked For Next Christmas  And Hope  Of Course  To Stay With You In Between! Best Wishes For The New Year  P. And N.,,,,,
,94,The Staff Were Excellent And Amazingly Helpful But The Food For The Sunday Dinner Was Fairly Awful With The Exception Of The Melon Carpaccio Which Was Lovely. The Room Was Nice And Clean But The Fact That The Towel Rail In The Bathroom Wouldn't Go Off Made The Bathroom Horribly Hot  Also And This May Just Be Preference On Our Part But The Bed Was Too Soft And Gave An Uncomfortable Nights Sleep. Breakfast Was Good And Once Again The Staff Were Lovely. Staff 10/10  Room 5/10  Dinner 4/10 And Breakfast 8/10.,,,,,
,95,Very Enjoyable  Relaxed Experience. Quality Of Food And Service Excellent.,,,,,
,96,Very Enjoyable And Having Stayed At The Hotel On Many Occasions We Knew What We Expected And We Were Not Disappointed. The Only Problem We Encounted Was Not Being Able To Have A Hot Bath Or Shower On New Years Eve Between 6Pm - 7.15Pm But This Is The Only Time We Have Experienced This Situation. It Did Not Spoil Our Night.,,,,,
,97,We Have Stayed At The Imperial  Before And Always Enjoyed Our Stay I Have A Gluten Intolerance But  All Your Dining Staff Are Helpful And Speak To The Chef Regarding Alternatives On The Menu They Brought Me A Delicious Bread And Butter Pudding One Evening.,,,,,
,98,Good  Quiet Service - Not Intrusive.,,,,,
,100,Relaxing Break,,,,,
,101,We Always Enjoy Staying At The Imperial And This Time Was As Good As Ever.  I Did Fill In The Survey Provided In The Bedroom Answering The Questions Now Being Posed.,,,,,
,103,We Always Enjoy Our Stay At The Imperial The  Staff Always Make The Stay With Friendliness  The Food Is Always  Very Good.,,,,,
,104,We Have Already Filled A Feed-Back. Why Is This Not Good Enough?,,,,,
,105,As Always Excellent,,,,,
,107,Just What We'd Hoped For,,,,,
,108,We Have Always Enjoyed Our Stay At The Imperial.,,,,,
,109,We Always Enjoy Our Stay At The Impterial.,,,,,
,111,Very Pleasant And Comfortable Stay Over Night With Very Good Food.,,,,,
,112,Very Pleased It Was Our  8Th Or 09 Visit To Stay At The Imperial,,,,,
,114,1St Class,,,,,
,115,First Class,,,,,
,116,We Really Enjoyed Our Stay. The Only Problem We Had Was No Hot Water On New Year's Eve. This Meant We Had A Cold Shower Which Spoiled Our Preparations For The Evening ,,,,,
,117,Excellent Relaxing Break  Ideal To Unwind Post Xmas  If A Little Bit Pricey,,,,,
,119,Absolutely Brilliant. Cannot Praise The Staff And Food Highly Enough. Many Compliments To The Chef And All His Staff.You Made Our Christmas. .,,,,,
,122,Very Enjoyable,,,,,
,123,Enjoyable And Relaxing New Year,,,,,

,140,Very Enjoyable Stay,,,,,
,141,Our Stay Was Really Enjoyable ,,,,,
,143,Hotel And Leisure Facilities Excellent.,,,,,
,144,The Staff At The Imperial All Made Us Feel Very Welcome.  The Food Over The Christmas Period Was Excellent And Our Room Comfortable.  Our Waitress Eva Looked After Us And Made The Dining Experience Special.,,,,,
,145,We Enjoyed The Imperial Overall  With The Exception Of The Small Bedroom Which We Found To Be Both Small & Cramped. We Stay In Llandudno Once Or Twice A Year  And We Chose The Imperial Over The St George Because The Room Description Was Given As 18M2 For Imperial  As Opposed To 16M2 For St George.  St George Was Slightly Cheaper But We Felt Room Space Was More Important. We Appreciate We Could Probably Have Upgraded To A Larger Room Had We Approached The Desk  But Chose Not To Do So. We Would Recommend The Imperial With The Proviso About Room Size. That Said  We Appreciated The Staff And Service Provided.,,,,,
,147,Brilliant.  The Staff Were Great  Lovely Room  Excellent Food.  Loved The Spa Facilitis,,,,,
,148,We Were Looking For A Couple Of Days Of Peace And Quiet After The Busyness Of Xmas And New Year. We Were Very Well Looked After By All Staff  Who Continued To Be Helpful And Cheerful After What Had Been A Very Busy Time For Them,,,,,
,149,All Staff Continued To Be Very Helpful And Pleasant After What Had Been A Very Busy Time For Them We Were Well Looked After,,,,,
,150,Very Relaxing ,,,,,
,152,This Was An Excellent Hotel  The Staff Were Very Helpful  Smart And Very Attentive  The Rooms Were Lovely As Was The Food. The Only Downside Was The Price Of The Drinks At The Bar And We Felt The Hotel Would Benefit From Some Entertainment Other Than The Disco,,,,,
,153,Enjoyable As Always,,,,,
,155,Absolutely Loved Our Stay At The Imperial - We Even Booked For A Third Night! Checking In Was Effortless  All The Staff Were Friendly And Welcoming - Really Made Us Feel Welcome And We're Already Looking To Book Our Next Visit.,,,,,
,156,As Always Impeccable Service And Delicious Food,,,,,
,158,Comfortable  Warm And Welcoming,,,,,
,159,A Relaxing Christmas Break.,,,,,
,160,Very Good  Freindly And Extremely Attentive And Knowledgable Staff  However The Food Within The Restaurent Is Way Over Priced And Overly Fussy.  On A Very Picky Note The Wine Glasses Used To Serve Wine By The Glass Are Way To Thick And Heavy  More Tumbler Than Fine Wine. Just An Observation.,,,,,
,161,Relaxed And Comfortable,,,,,
,162,Although Our Stay On This Occasion Was For Only One Night We Were So Relaxed When We Left That We Felt That We Had Stayed Longer! The Food And Service Was Excellent And We Look Forward To Our Next Visit.,,,,,
,163,Excellent,,,,,
,164,Extremely Comfortable  Friendly  Good Service And A Reliable High Standard.,,,,,
,166,Couldn't Ask For More. All Staff Are Friendly But Professional. Rooms Are Well Appointed   If A Little Too Warm  Evenwith The Windows Open And No Heating On In December During A Gale Force Wind. Food Is Excellent. ( My Husband Eats Food At The Imperial That He Would Not Dream Of Eating At Home And He Thoroughly Enjoys It.) Hats Off To The Chefs !!! Made Good Use Of The Loyalty Card.

,173,The Ambience Is Just Right Very Relaxing Atmosphere.The Staff Are Helpful Without Being Intrusive.,,,,,
,175,Very Nice,,,,,
,176,Fairly Good But Rather Expensive For Out Of Season,,,,,
,177,The Staff Were Friendly  Efficient And Very Helpful. The Food Was Delicious.  All Of The Staff  Went Out Of Their Way To Make Our Stay Comfortable.  The New Year Was Fantastic  Again Every Member Of Staff  Nothing Was Too Much Trouble! I Would Certainly Recommend This Hotel To Anyone  And Look Forward To Returning.,,,,,

,219,We Have Visited The Imperial On The Last Weekend Of January Every Year For Some Considerable Time Now And Would Not Stay Anywhere Else.

,3,Overall For The Price I Paid I Was Very Pleased - Good Value,,,,,
,5,I Made My Reservation With Kirsty By Direct Email Form My Work  She Was Very Efficient With Her Reply's In Letting Me Know If You Had Availabillity For A Staff Concession On The Date I Was Looking For  Kirsty Replied Within Minutes So I Booked In Instantly  Excellent Service  It Was Booked Within Minutes.,,,,,
,6,Faultless Experience All The Way.,,,,,
,7,Thought It Was Strange That Reception Did Not Take Our Car Registration. Does This Mean Anyone Can Park In The Car Park? Lady On Reception Was Professionally Polite However Her Demeanor Made Us Feel Uncomfortable As She Was Quite Frosty Towards Us.,,,,,
,9,We Had The Best Time Ever  Certainly Be Going Again!!!,,,,,
,10,Every Member Of Staff We Encountered  Whether In The Car Park  Reception  Dining Room Or In The Corridors  Was Very Friendly & Accommodating.,,,,,

,27,None.,,,,,
,28,None,,,,,
,30,One Small Quibble - When Booking Over The 'Phone  We Found Our Usual Room 308 Was Not Available  But We Were Told That 208 Was Identical. Sadly  This Turned Out Not To Be The Case. The Rooms On The Third Floor Have More Windows In The Bedroom  Or At Least 308 Does. This Did Make A Difference To The View  But The Room Was Still Lovely And This Did Not In Any Way Spoil Our Experience. I Just Felt That It Was Important That Staff Know The Difference Between The Floors,,,,,
,32,Busy Desk And Staff No Real Contact,,,,,
,35,Everyone We Came Into Contact With Was Most Friendly And Welcoming,,,,,
,36,Very Helpful Staff,,,,,
,37,Pre Arrival Contact Excellent However On Arrival No One Informed Us About The Spa Pool Or The Facilities Times Of Operation Etc. Perhaps This Was Because We Are In Our 60'S And It Was Assumed We Had Read The The Hotel's Literature Or We Were Too Old For That Facility. This Is Not A Major Issue,,,,,
,38,No,,,,,
,40,First Class,,,,,
,41,Thank You To All The Staff,,,,,
,44,Everybody Got Caught On The Double Press Of A Button To Get The Tv Working  Some Gave Up Thinking It Was Faulty When No Channels Available  Others Happened To Read The Room Brochure Book And Figured It Out As It Explained This In There. Possibly A Sign On The Tv To Explain This And Some Of Our Guests Thought The Tv Was Broken. ,,,,,
,46,All Went Smoothly .,,,,,
,49,Very Friendly On The Phone When Booking And Lovely Welcome On Arrival.,,,,,
,50,Very Efficient & Professional. Excellent Telephone Manner.,,,,,

,86,We Know Its A Problem But More Free Parking Would Be Great.,,,,,
,87,Always Friendly And Particularly The Reception Staff,,,,,
,88,We Arrived On Spec And The Front Desk Staff Sorted Us Out Very Well. We Did Do Some Homework First And The Rate Quoted In Person Was Actually Higher Than On The Internet. Also Not All Rooms Seem To Be Listed On The Internet. As I Said  The Front Desk Staff Were Very Good And Efficient.,,,,,
,90,No.  Excellent In Every Way.,,,,,
,92,Reception Staff And Help With Luggage Most Helpful  And Professional.,,,,,
,95,Limited Car Parking May Have Been A Problem  But This Was Dealt With Satisfactorily,,,,,
,96,Our Contact At The Imperial Is Lesley And She Carries Out Her Duties Extremely Well Very Professional,,,,,
,97,I Would Have Found Entering Easier As I Am Disability Badge Holder And Have Difficulty With My  Balance. It Would Have Been A Lot Safer If I Could Have Got A Park At The Back Of The Hotel Out Of The High Wind We Parked On The Front And Had Be Helped To The Side Door After Struggling Out Of The Car.,,,,,
,98,I Have Been Staying At This Hotel For Over 10 Years- At Least Twice A Year.  It Would Be Good If I Didn't Have To Go Through The Same Processes To Register As Those Who Are First Time Guests.,,,,,
,104,We Commened Sarah In Reception For Special Kindness. Good I Could Not Get Any Hot Water For My Shower. Partly Sisabled  So Could Noty Bath.,,,,,
,108,No  Everything Was Fine.,,,,,
,111,Staff Were Helpful,,,,,
,112,No,,,,,
,114,No,,,,,
,115,No,,,,,
,117,The Room Was Ready Upon Our Arrival And Nice To Be Allocated Access Over 2 Hours Early. Problems With Key Card On 2 Occasions Not Operating.,,,,,
,122,Did Not Like The Disagreement Between Reception Staff And Porter Over Parking And Unloading  On Arrival.David Is Disabled And Is Not Able To Walk Too Far So Wanted To Get Our Car Close To Door.Your Hotel Car Was In A Prime Spot And Should Have Been Freed Up For Disabled,,,,,
,124,Car Parking A Bit Of A Headache,,,,,
,127,I Always Get A Good Welcome From Your Porters. Reception Staff - Mixed Depending Who Is On Duty.,,,,,
,130,Spoke To Sarah On Phone  Always An Enjoyable Experience. She Is Always So Helpful And Friendly,,,,,
,133,No,,,,,
,139,Booked The New Years Eve Stay During A Previous Visit - At That Time The Staff Were Extremely Friendly And Well Informed. Deposit Was Paid With The Utmost Efficiency.

,162,As I Send In My Email To You Before Our Visit  Our First Impression When Booking On The Telephone Was Courteously And Professionally Handled By Bethan.,,,,,
,163,No,,,,,
,165,I Am Afraid My Adverse Comments Must Be Solely Directed To Your Reception Staff On Arrival At The Desk Your Receptionist 'Bethan' Glanced My Way Curtley Saying 'What's Your Name' No Hello  No Please No Thank You Then Handing Me The Keys In The Same Manner Making Me Feel As If I Was A Nuisance By Coming To Your Hotel.On Departure All Was Mainly The Same Could'nt Care Less Too Interested In Talking To Each Other Having Had My Own Business For Thirty Years  Dealing Directly With The Public I Know How Important It Is For The Staff 'Up Front' To Be At Their Best At All Times.It Is Unfortunate That A Small Number Are Letting Down The Rest  All Of Who Were Excellent. I Trust You Will Find My Comments Helpful,,,,,
,166,Reception Staff   Both In Person And On The Telephone Very Friendly And Helpful On All Accounts. Portering Staff Also Very Helpful,,,,,
,168,The Champagne And Chocolates Were Not Inthe Room When We Arrived- Though In Fairness We Arived Early Ar 12.30 Rather Than 2.00Pm,,,,,
,170,I Had Made A Phone Call Regarding Equipment Needed By My 92 Year Old Mother In Her Room Only To Find That The Information Had Been Carried Forward From Previous Visits And Had Been Already Organised And Dealt With. Also I Had Pre Arranged A Parking Space By Phone On Our Day Of Arrival With A Wheelchair Ready For Use In The Basement Area. This Was All Prepared And Avoided A Potentially Very Stressful Situation Enabling Us To Enter Into The Christmas Spirit Seamlessly!,,,,,
,173,There Needs To Be An Instant Attraction When The Christmas Tree Is Dismantled To Banish The "January Blues.",,,,,
,175,No,,,,,

,183,Nice Staff At Reception,,,,,
,184,We Were Lucky Enough To Get A Parking Space Which Was Great But It Meantwe Entered By The Back Door And So Didn't Get The Full Benefit Of Walking Through The Main Entrance Which Is Always A Shame I Think - In Hindsight! Emma Was On Reception And Was Great.,,,,,
,187,All Was Smooth & Efficient.,,,,,
,190,No Nothing To Add It Was Just 1St Class ,,,,,
,192,Very Friendly Attentive Reception Staff,,,,,
,194,Straightforward Booking  Very Pleasant Staff.,,,,,
,196,No,,,,,
,197,Professional And Efficient,,,,,
,199,I Was Not Aware That You Have Car Parking Facilities - This Could E Important At Busier Times,,,,,
,201,Staff Were Professional But Not Very Engaging (Lacked A Little Bit Of Warmth),,,,,
,203,On Arrival It Was Not Explained Dinner Had To Be Booked Or Gratuity Policy,,,,,
,205,Rear Entrance From Carpark Substandard,,,,,
,210,Parking Was A Little Difficult As Spaces Were A Premium However  Well Worth The Minor Inconvenience Of Feeding The Parking Meter.   ,,,,,

,1,Room 317 - The Room Was Too Hot,,,,,
,3,328 - Only Thing That Could Be Improved Was The Shower Screen Did Not Stop The Water Going Onto The Bathroom Floor And I Had To Mop Up A Puddle Around The Door To The Bathroom.,,,,,
,4,We Felt That It Would Have Been Of Great Assistance To Have Had A Hand Rail To Assist In Getting Into And Out Of The Bath To Use The Shower As The Bath Sides Are Quite High For People Of Our Age  I.E Over The Age Of 70Yrs.,,,,,
,5,Room Number 314  Only Thing Is That The Towel Rail Was On Constantly In The Bathroom And Was Boiling Hot  This Made It Rather Uncomfortable To Sleep At Night As The Heat Was Coming Into The Bedroom  We Had To Sleep With The Windows Open All Night Which Was A Bit Noisy  And That The Double Bed Was 2 Single Beds Pushed Together Which Meant There Was A Gap Right Down Te Middle Of The Bed.,,,,,
,6,Room 310. Two Seater Settee Could Do With A Little Fabric Cleaner.,,,,,
,7,Stopped In Room 210 - Fantastic Room And Views. Loved The Fact This Room Had A Sofa So We Could Watch Tv Comfortably. ,,,,,
,8,Small Point I Know  But A Nail File Would Have Been A Help.,,,,,
,10,Room 517 Was Lovely  And Always Clean Apart From Cobwebs Above The Bed.  It Was Lovely To Come Back To A Room That Was Made Up. ,,,,,
,11,No,,,,,
,12,Fabulous And Comfortable,,,,,
,14,The Radiator In The Bathroom Needed To Be Dusted At The Back!,,,,,
,19,Room 419. King Size Bed Should Be Standard In A 4 Star Hotel. ,,,,,
,21,I Love Any Room That Has A Plug Socket Next To The Bed For My Phone - That's Why I Always Ask For Room 101 Which Also Has A Walk In Shower.,,,,,
,22,Room 512 Small Window Near Desk.  Lovely Views But Window Filthy ( Outside ).,,,,,
,27,None.,,,,,
,28,Outside Of Windows Could Have Been Cleaner Spoilt And Excellent View,,,,,
,32,Poorly Prepared. And Needs Attention In Re The Usual Scuffs And Marks From Occupation. Which Are Inevitable But Easy To Remedy,,,,,
,37,Room 416 See Earlier Comments,,,,,
,44,Can't Remember,,,,,
,45,See Above Re Noise Levels And Minor Faults,,,,,
,46,No,,,,,
,50,Room422. Nocomplaints Whatsoever.,,,,,
,54,Lovely Room Lovely View,,,,,
,60,315 Is A Wonderful Room - We Always Request It.,,,,,
,62,522 Could Have Done With The Wall Under Window In Dressing Room Wiping Or Painting.  Marks On Wall Probably From Luggage. But The Room Was Otherwise Very Clean And Loved Having The Mini Balcony With A Bit Of A Sea View. Had Cuppa Out There Sat Morning Even Though It Was Blowing A Gale!,,,,,
,63,420. Cobwebs On The Bedroom Ceiling. Used Tissues In Pocket Of Bathrobe. No Shampoo In Bathroom.  Double Bed Was 2 Singles Therefore Uncomfortable Gap In The Middle. ,,,,,
,64,420. Cobwebs On Bedroom Ceiling.  Used Tissues In Pockets Of Bathrobe.  Dust On Bathroom Glass Shelf. No Shampoo In Bathroom On First Day.,,,,,
,68,315 Only Complaint Is Pillows Not Of High Standard. Will Bring My Own Next Time!! But I Am Rather Fussy About My Pillow!!  ,,,,,
,69,418 Room Was Uncomfortably Hot. All Radiators Were Off And Window Full Open. Otherwise The Room Was Excellent.,,,,,
,71,Very Comfortable And Quiet Room (124),,,,,
,72,No The Room Was Very Clean And Tidy Could Not Had Ask For More.,,,,,
,73,Walk-In Shower Would Be Preferred. Also A Fridge Is Usual In A 4Star Room. Better Reading Lights By The Bed. Arm Chairs Not Very Comfortable For Reading/Tv.   The Fan In The Bathroom Did Not Work. We Expect You Know That Windows Are In Need Of Attention. The One In The Bathroom Leaked And Had A Towel To Catch The Water.  Main Bedroom Window Rattled And Let In The Cold Wind In Exceptional Weather. ,,,,,
,74,No,,,,,
,76,Room No 317  Lovely Chambermaid  So Helpful  Clean And Cheerful.,,,,,
,78,Room 427. The Only Complaint We Have Is That The Water From The Shower Wasn't Very Hot.,,,,,
,79,503  We Weren't Sure The Room Would Survive The Winds!,,,,,
,81,327 Unfortunately On Departure Morning There Wasn't Any Hot Water For Our Showers. Windows Rattled. Difficult To Read Thermostat On Radiator. Carpet Rucked In Middle Of Room.,,,,,
,82,Room 208.  The Net Curtains In The Bathroom Were A Bit On The Grubby Side Which Rather Let The Side Down.  Otherwise Everything Was Fine.,,,,,
,83,311 Was Found To Be A Very Warm Room We Only Used The Towel Rail In The Bathroom  Did Not Use The Room Radiator Could Become Uncomfortable At Night. 'No Complains' ,,,,,
,87,Thank You For The Christmas Tree. As We Had A Lot Of Family With Us We Had Considered Bringing Our Own Tree To Open Presents In The Suite  But Decided Against It What A Pleasant Surprise To Find You Had Already Provided Us With One !,,,,,
,88,We Stayed In A Suite  First Floor Right On The Landing. I Think It Was No 14. It Opened Into A Small Hall Anti-Room And Then Into The Lounge Area. The Curtains On The Side Facing The Road Did Not Pull To The Center. We Had To Overlap Them To Avoid Being Overlooked By Folk In The Opposite Hotel. There Was An Odd Mix Of 13 And 15 Amp Sockets And Plugs.  What We Had Was Extremely Comfortable Albeit A Little Tired And In Need Of Some Tlc. The Tv Remote Would Not Switch Off The Tv. Had To Do It On The Socket. ,,,,,
,90,325.  Excellent In Every Way.  Duvet May Have Been Too Warm For Some.,,,,,
,94,As Previously Said The Bed And Towel Rail Made Things Uncomfortable.,,,,,
,96,Room 412 Perfect,,,,,
,97,311'We Had To Remove Ginger Biscuit Crumbs Out Of The Top Drawer Before We Could Unpack As It Was During The Christmas Period And Guess The Staff Were Wanting To Be Getting Home We Didn't Bother Too Much. Every Thing Else Was Fine.,,,,,
,98,Bedside Light Didn't Work.  Dust On Bedside Cabinet.  Better Quality Control Would Be Useful,,,,,
,100,Not Enough Tea And Milk Provided In Bedroom During Our Stay,,,,,
,103,Every Time We Stay The Rooms Are Always Ready And Clean.,,,,,
,108,Room 310.   The Bed In This Room Is A Bit Hard And Although We Have Asked For A Mattress Topper It Is Still Hard.,,,,,
,111,317 - No Biscuits On The Welcome Tray As In Other Rooms Were Family Were.,,,,,
,112,On,,,,,
,114,No,,,,,
,119,Constantly Having To Ring Down For Tea Sugar And Toilet Roll. Also Had To Keep Asking For Heating To Be Put On. Room Was Not Cleaned To Usual High Standard.,,,,,
,123,The Room Was Clean But There Were A Few Cob Webs On The Ceiling Above The Pillows On The Bed . Room 210,,,,,
,124,526 Very Good,,,,,
,126,Room No. 311.   We Would Very Much Like To Have A Safe In The Room And The Same Goes For All The Other Rooms We Have Stayed In At The Hotel.,,,,,
,127,Due To High Winds Room 127 Was Very Noisy With A Banging Noise All Night.  Steve  The Porter  Tried To Find The Source Of The Noise But We Came To The Conclusion That It Must Have Been One Of The Vents From The Kitchen That Is Loose.,,,,,
,129,The Radiator In The Bedroom Was Not Working Properly It Was Seen To As Soon As We Told The Staff But It Went Off Again.,,,,,
,130,We Were In 211 And Then Moved To 308. The Lighting In 308 Could Be Better.,,,,,
,132,Excellent ,,,,,
,133,No,,,,,
,139,Room 519 - Much Bigger Than First Impression  The Separate Dressing Room Was Ideal And The Bathroom Was Well Appointed.,,,,,
,140,No Problems,,,,,
,143,Very Nice Room (Room 120),,,,,
,145,See Earlier Comments - Room 526. Too Much Furniture For The Size Of The Room  Which Made It Awkward To Get Around Comfortably  Especially During The Night.,,,,,
,149,Room 420Was A Lovely Room In Respect Of Bathroom Some Grab Rails In The Shower Would Be Helpful  Particularly To 'Older' Guests. I Appreciate It May Affect The Ambience Of The Bathroom  But From A Safety Angle Would Be Worthwhile. I Am Saying This Although I Am Fortunately Still Fit And Able  But If It Had Been My Parents  They Would Have Struggled  ,,,,,
,150,317 A Moveable Shower Head Like You Have In Some Bathrooms Would Make Showering Easier,,,,,
,152,Room 319  Excellent Room Very Clean And A Very Good Size.,,,,,
,155,The Suite Was Fantastic - Our Children Loved The Fact They Had Their Own Rooms With A Tv (A Luxury For Them). Decor Was Great And In-Keeping With The Building. There Was A Nasty 'Swimming Baths Changing Room' Smell In The Bathroom When We First Arrived - This Was Flagged Up At Reception And Was Addressed So When We Returned To The Room After A Few Hours Of Enjoying Llandudno It Was Completely Gone.,,,,,
,158,Some Corrider Door Noise But Not Excessive,,,,,
,159,Room 508.  Unfortunately The Window Catch Was Broken So When The High Winds Hit On Boxing Day Evening It Blew Open And We Could Not Keep  It Shut!  It Would Have Been Nice If Someone Had Noticed/Reported The Problem Before. My Daughter And I Were Moved To Another Room 502 For The Rest Of The Night As It Was Impossible To Sleep In There. We Were Allocated Room 212 For Our Final Night.,,,,,
,161,308 The Shower Was Difficult To Use And Hard To Get In To.  Grab Rails As Standard And Flexible Shower Head Would Have Been Appreciated,,,,,
,162,Room 215 Was Well Appointed  Spotlessly Clean And Relaxing.,,,,,
,163,No,,,,,
,165,Room 310 - Congratulations Should Be Given To The Housekeeper On Our Arrival As She Was Very Friendly And Obliging And The Room Was Extremely Comfortable.,,,,,
,166,Only Critisism Is That Whichever Room We Have Stayed In  And We Have Been To The Imperial A Few Times Now  The Room Has Been Too Warm. Otherwise Very Satisfactory.,,,,,
,168,Very Warm And Comfortable,,,,,
,176,Room Was Too Warm At Night,,,,,
,180,Great Room  Great View Couldnt Ask For More,,,,,
,181,I Will Visit The Pool And Fitness Suite On My Next Visut,,,,,
,182,Excellent As Disabled Access Needed. Bathroom And Walk In Shower Lovely.,,,,,
,184,Loved The Room.,,,,,
,187,120 The Chambermaid Was Most Helpful Polite &Efficient.,,,,,
,189,It Was A Bit Too Hot For Us - But We Opened The Windows And Turned Radiators Down.  Prefer This Problem To Being Cold.,,,,,
,190,As  Previous``,,,,,
,192,Room 208. Enjoyed The Visit Staying In This Room. Have Always Booked A Sea View Room So I Knew What To Expect And Was Not Disappointed ,,,,,
,194,Room 215 The Hot Tap Did Not Work Correctly   Reported To Reception As We Left  Not A Big Issue And Did Not Spoil The Stay.,,,,,
,197, 522 We Had To Ask For More Milk To Have Tea In Our Room. This Was Provided  But Perhaps A Few More Offered In The Room Would Be Useful.,,,,,
,200,Room 212 Would Have Liked A Fridge ,,,,,
,201,319 - Would Love To Stay In Same Room Again.,,,,,
,205,Rear Room With Old Draughty Windows,,,,,
,209,212 A Fridge Would Be Appreciated,,,,,
,210,Perfect Even Though I Could See  The Car Park I Could See The Sea And The Vista Was Relaxing Just What I Needed After Christmas Rushing Around Like A Headless Chicken .      ,,,,,
,211,Room 310 - Comfortable And Well Appointed,,,,,
,213,Room 315.   Even Though I Had Taken The Card Out Of The Electric Slot The Lights Could Still Come On Which I Thought Was Strange  It Has Never Happened To Us Before!  However  Everything Else Was To A High Standard.,,,,,
,216,Room 325. Nice And Warm.,,,,,
,218,318 - Too Small.  Didnt Realise Had A Single Bed,,,,,
,219,The Room Was Extremely Hot Uncomfortable Particularly At Night Trying To Sleep.,,,,,
,222,Stayed In Room 315 And There Was An Issue With The Toilet That Was Blocked On The Sunday Morning.  When Draining The Sink The Blockage Seemed To Disappear But Could Have Been So Much Worse.,,,,,
,223,329.  Wall Lights Not Working. Heating Too High And No Ventilation. Opened Windows And Switched Off The Radiator Thermostats  Then No Problem.,,,,,
,224,422 Good Toilet Paper-Rarely Found In Hotels-Fresh Face Cloths ,,,,,
,226,509.  I Asked For A Front Room And Was Thrilled With The Additional Seating Are And The Sea Views.  ,,,,,
,230,Lovely To Have Bottled Water In The Room ,,,,,
,231,Room  Number   434    To     Hot,,,,,
,239,We Found The Room Very Warm  Even During The Night With The Radiators Off And The Windows Open.,,,,,
,240,The Water Takes A While To Run Hot When Washing Or Having A Shower.,,,,,
,242,Original Room (506) Was Noisy Because Of Very Strong Winds Buffeting Something On The Roof. Moved To (319) Without Any Hassle And Enjoyed The Quiet.,,,,,
,244,One Of The Sockets Was Loose.  The Curtains Were In Need Of Attention.  We Pointed These Things Out Before We Left.,,,,,

,8,The Food And Service Was Really Nice As Usual But The Dessert (Pear Trifle) Was A Bit Sloppy And I Didn't Really Enjoy It.

Exceptional Means Just That And Although I Ticked "Agree"  The Question Was Really Leading The Witness. We Enjoyed The Meal We Had And The Service Was Very Good. It's All To Do With Expectations. We Will Return.,,,,,
,90,No.  Excellent In Every Way.,,,,,
,94,Sunday Dinner Was Disappointing With A Definite School Canteen Feel To It  Service However Was Faultless.,,,,,
,96,No  We Were Very Satisfied,,,,,
,97,I Answered This Before Oops Sorry,,,,,
,103,No,,,,,
,107,Enjoyed Our Meal. Only Comment Was That It Was Served A Little Too Quickly,,,,,
,111,Very Pleasant Experience.,,,,,
,112,No,,,,,
,115,First Classs,,,,,
,116,Very Good Food Served Well By Friendly And Helpful Staff ,,,,,
,117,Menu Choices Not Varied Enough If Staying More Than 2 Days. Same Starters Offered Sat And Sun ,,,,,
,119,Excellent Christmas Meals For The Whole Period We Were There.,,,,,
,123,We Were Disappointed That The Afternoon Tea  Was Not Available On The Tables And Was Served As If In A Self Service Cafeteria And Not A 4* Hotel. Also Sandwiches Are Usually Included In An Afternoon Tea.,,,,,
,124,Hard To Say As We Were There For New Year,,,,,
,126,The Chef And His Team Are To Be Congratulated For Being Able To Produce Such Choice For So Many Diners At The Gala Dinner And Get In To The Table With No Delay Between Courses.,,,,,
,127,See Comments About The Terrace.  The Staff Are Good  The Food Is Good But Have You Looked At The State Of The Curtains And Carpet Lately?,,,,,
,129,The Food Is Excellent And The Staff Are Very Good,,,,,
,130,An Enjoyable Experience,,,,,
,131,The Service Was Messy  The Food Was Ok. The Waiters Did Not Have A Particular Section To Cover  Which Means That We Had 2 Waiters Taking Our Order  Nobody To Bring Us Bread  Two Waiters Asking Us For Our Drink Orders  Then Table Next To Us  Was Offered Twice For Water Refill And We Didn't,,,,,
,133,Too Expensive And Limited Menu,,,,,
,139,Dined In This Restaurant On Numerous Occasions And Will Continue To Do So  The Excellent Food Is Matched By The Ambience And Friendly  Efficient Staff.,,,,,
,141,We Found Bastian And The Spanish Waitress  Name Not Known Were Exceptionally Friendly And Helpful ,,,,,
,143,We Have Dined In Chantrey's Restaurant On Several Of Our Previous Visits And In The Past We Have Been Disapointed By The Service When The Wine We Ordered With Our Meal Arrived Only Towards The End Of The Main Course. For This Reason We Decided This Time To Eat Elsewhere  However We Were Enjoying Our Stay So Much That We Decided Not Only To Stay For An Extra Night But Also To Give Chantrey's Restaurant Another Try. Unfortunately We Were Again Disappointed  Not By The Food  Which Was Excellent  But By The Service. We Ordered Some Drinks And Asked For A Wine List Before We Ordered Our Meals. The Starters Arrived But Still No Sign Of Our Drinks Or Even The Wine List. I Asked Where They Were And Was Told They Were Coming. They Arrived Only When We Were Half Way Through The First Course....  At Which Point I Was Eventually Given My Soup Spoon.... I Had Already Had To Consume Most Of It With A Desert Spoon. If The Chef Has Time To Prepare Starters And Get Them To Table Then Why Are The Drinks And Wine List Unable To Arrive Before Them? Eventually I Sought The Help Of A Nearby Female Waitress And Told Her We Were Getting Annoyed  We Were Still Waiting For Our Drinks  She Was Very Good  She Took Over Our Table And From That Point All Went Well But By Then We Were So Irritated That It Spoiled Our Dining Experience At Chantery's.  ,,,,,
,152,The Menu Was Excellent,,,,,
,155,Our Dining Consisted Of Sandwiches And Breakfast In Our Room. We Also Had Breakfast In Chantrey's. Thoroughly Enjoyed It. We Have Dined At The Imperial On Various Other Occasions And Have Always Enjoyed It.,,,,,
,158,Very Pleasant Particularly The Veranda. Very Warm On Cold Evening,,,,,
,162,As It Was January It Was Probably Understandable That There Wasn't Many People In The Restaurant. This Was A Pity As The Food Was Delicious And The Service Was Excellent.,,,,,
,163,No,,,,,
,164,One Of Us Has Dietary Problems And Has To Keep The Food Simple  So It Is Difficult To Fully Appreciate The Quality Of The Full Menu.,,,,,
,165,The Fine Dining Experience Is Not To Our Liking As In The Way The Food Is Presented But This Is Just Our Personal Opinion.,,,,,
,166,Perfect.,,,,,
,168,No,,,,,
,170,The Terrace Area Is Used During The Christmas Period For Both Breakfast And Dinner And Is Very Successful Although Only For Couples. Sometimes The Dining Room Lacks The Intimacy That The Terrace Provides.,,,,,
,180,Great Food For All Meals  ,,,,,
,182,Great Atmosphere  Excellent Service.,,,,,
,184,The Terrace Was Lovely.,,,,,
,190,As  Previous,,,,,
,193,We Only Had Breakfast During This Stay.,,,,,
,201,Nice Choice And Catered For Special Dietry Requirements. I Do Think The Wine Is Over Priced.,,,,,
,205,Alright  But Very Expensive In Comparison With Other Restaurants,,,,,
,208,The Menu In The Chantrey's Restaurant Could Be More Inventive  If The Stay Is Three Days  Then  Other Than What Is Available On The Specials  I Find Your Main Menu Very Repetative.,,,,,
,210,Leave Plenty Of Room In Your Tum For A Tantalizing Array Of Delicious Deserts.    ,,,,,
,211,Excellent Food As Always,,,,,
,216,More Choice For Vegetarians.,,,,,
,219,Restaurant Is Excellent Food Cooked To Perfection Everything Was So Good.,,,,,
,221,Again Your Staff Made The Event An Experience ,,,,,
,223,Very Good But Not Exceptional.,,,,,
,224,Service Was Very Good Until Breakfast On Sunday Morning When We Were "Told Off" For Not Leaving Our Menus Standing-This It Seems Is An Unwritten Rule Which Indicates To The Serving Staff That Service Is Required-I Didn't Mind Having To Remind The Waiter We Required Service But To Be Told Off For Breaching A Convention Unknown To Me Was Unpleasant.,,,,,
,226,Not As Many Gluten Free Options As Intimated When I Booked.     ,,,,,
,228,The Food Is Always Superb  I Always Struggle To Decide What To Have As The Choice Is So Good And Wish We Were Staying Longer So I Could Try Another Option,,,,,
,230,The Restaurant Staff Were Excellent ,,,,,
,232,Was Slightly Disappointed With Our Lunch As The Sandwich Bread Was Slightly Stale.,,,,,
,241,With Limited Numbers Staying At The Hotel The Use Of The Terrace Was A Good Idea.Service Was More Friendly On The Thursday Evening Than On The Tuesday  With No Loss Of Professionalism.,,,,,
,244,Very Limited Choice Of Gluten Free Dishes For Coeliacs.  But The Staff Were Able To Adapt Some Dishes On Request. We Think More Thought Could Be Given To Making More Dishes Coeliac Friendly.,,,,,

,7,Spa Pool Was Not Open Any Of The 4 Nights We Were There Which Was Very Disappointing For Us. Sauna And Steam Room Were Great  Used Every Day.,,,,,
,21,Gym Equipment Is A Little Old As Is The Pool & Jacuzzi But Both Are Maintained To A High Level Of Cleanliness.,,,,,
,24,Jacuzzi Out Of Action - Limited Pool Experience,,,,,
,28,Environment When Using The Lift Could Be Helped By Improved Decoration Felt Like Being In A Cellar. Dissapointed That The Jaccouzi Was Not Working.,,,,,
,45,Need A Timer/Clock In The Sauna,,,,,
,62,Would Have Considered A Treatment On Friday But After 4,,,,,
,83,Tried To Book The Beauty Lounge Fully Booked Until After We Had Returned Home  May Be A Good Idea Advise To Prebook Before Arriving At The Hotel !,,,,,
,86,Cannot Wait For The Jacuzzi Area To Be Finished.,,,,,
,87,We Would Have Liked To Have Had Time To Use The Center. I Brought My Costume But Did Not Find Time To Use The Pool With All The Other Things Going On With The Family.  The Younger Ones I Know Enjoyed The Pool And The Exercise Machines,,,,,
,103,No,,,,,
,126,Only Used The Swimming Pool.,,,,,
,141,I Found Having To Get Changed In The Room And Walking Around In Dressing Gowns And Non Fitting Slippers Poor,,,,,
,147,We Would Have Liked To Have Had A Treatment But The Salon Was Fully Booked. Wish We Had Been Advised To Pre Book  ,,,,,
,155,We Used The Swimming Pool And Enjoyed It. It Was Great For The Children Though The Positioning Of The Toilets Wasn't Ideal As It Meant Leaving The Pool Area To Walk Through The Gym Area In A Towel (Perhaps A Stone And A Half Lighter And I Wouldn't Mind So Much!). This Is A Historic Building So The Leisure Facilities Have Been Built Within The Space Available So Can't Really Complain About The Layout And The Staff Were Friendly And Explained The Procedure. They Made You Feel Comfortable Despite Being Stood In A Towel And Slippers!,,,,,
,162,Just One - To Avoid Having To Walk Through The Hotel In Dressing Gown And Slippers It Would Be Good If Changing Facilities Could Be Incorporated.,,,,,
,168,Excellent Facility,,,,,
,175,Hangng Place For Robe & No Way Of Identifying Own Robe As Some One Took Mine With Room Key Card In Pocket. ,,,,,
,184,I Was Actually A Bit Disappointed. No Staff Member Was Available While We Were There. We Did Not Know Where To Put Our Belongings. The Shower Was Broken. It Did Not Feel Right Walking Through The Hotel In Wet Robes Etc. We Only Used The Pool Steam And Sauna. ,,,,,
,192,Overall Quite Good. Area Around Water Machine Could Do With More Attention. I Was The Only One In But There Were Robes And Towels Living Around. Corridor To Pool And Steam And Sauna Could Do With A Bit Of Tlc As Well Maybe A Lick Of Paint.,,,,,
,200,Just Used The Pool And Spa,,,,,
,202,Did Not See Any Members Of Staff In The Fitness Suite  But Saw The Register On The Desk And Duly Signed In And Out.  Unusual Arrangement Of Not Being Allowed To Use Changing Rooms In The Fitness Centre.  Even Though Robes And Slippers Provided  Other Guests Were Removing Wet Swimwear Under  Towels And Their Robes  Not Comfortable Watching This Going On!!!  ,,,,,
,213,A Great Facility  Thank You!,,,,,
,224,Good Pool Sensible Depth And Size,,,,,

,81,Perhaps Transport To Pantomime Needs Reconsideration As Most Are Elderly And Experience Problems Negotiating Steep Steps.,,,,,
,88,On Question 19: I Have High Expectations Of The Imperial  Which Were Met. Even In December! To Enhance Our Experience: Make Sure Curtains Close / That Plugs Fit Sockets / That General Wear And Tear Marks On Walls And Door-Frames Are Touched In. Simple Visible Things That Folk Notice And Don't Comment On. When Was The Last Time A Member Of Staff Actually Stayed In Our Room With A Clip Board To Note Things Down On?  I Have No Idea How Much The General Maintenance Costs On A Hotel Of This Size. I Only Know That Not Keeping It Up To Scratch Is A Downward Slope. We Like The Imperial.,,,,,

,8,To Hear Someone Playing The Piano For A While In The Bar Is Always A Bonus But Doesn't Seem To Happen Very Often.,,,,,
,10,We Would Have Taken Advantage Of The Balcony Had It Been A Little Warmer  But It Was Great To Take A Look Out In A Morning  And Take A Breath Of Fresh Air.,,,,,
,11,None,,,,,
,12,I Will Be Returning Both For Business And Leisure Purposes,,,,,
,14,I Wish Llandudno Was Not So Far Away As I Would Return Again Had It Not Taken 4.5 Long Hours To Drive From South Wales!! ,,,,,
,20,I Do Feel You Need To Keep A Tight Reign On Cost As Our 2 Night Stay In Two Sea-Fronted Rooms Resulted In A Final Bill Of £759. Perhaps You Could Look At Discounted Rates For Frequent Visitors As An Incentive To Keep Us Coming!,,,,,
,21,Some Of The Other Rooms I Have Stayed In Have Not Been Pre-Heated Which In The Winter Can Be Very Cold.,,,,,
,22,Found It Difficult To Find The Massage Treatment Room.  Just Had A Love Heart On Door.  No Treatment In Progress Sign Did Cause Embarrssment!,,,,,
,27,A Very Enjoyable Stay To Start Our Xmas Season.,,,,,
,28,No,,,,,
,32,No,,,,,
,35,Nothing That You Can Do  But Getting Rid Of Those Offshore Windmills Would Be A Real Bonus.  I Am Sure There Are More Than Our Last Visit.,,,,,
,37,Dear Mr Lofthouse We Have A Mutual Friend Tony And Kim Davies From Hough Near Nantwich. It Was Tony Who Recommended The Hotel Which Was Otherwise Excellent But Fell Down Slightly As Per Our Comments Elsewhere  On The Strength Of Tony's Recommendation We Encouraged My Sister And Husband To Accompany Us. It Was When We Were Reflecting Back On Our Experience Over The 2 Days That Being Hyper Critical These Small Points Just Marred The Weekend Slightly.  ,,,,,
,42,My Only Criticism Is That At Breakfast The Staff Should Make Sure That You Have Finished Eating The Cereal/Starter Course Before Bringing The Cooked Breakfast. This Has Happened Twice  On This Last Visit & On A Previous Visit.,,,,,
,46,No,,,,,
,49,We Will Be Back.,,,,,
,50,No,,,,,
,53,We Had Breakfast In The Hotel And Will Probably Dine There One Evening Next Year,,,,,
,54,See You Next Year!!,,,,,
,56,Thank You To All For A Very Enjoyable Stay,,,,,
,62,It Was Nice To Be Able To Park The Car On The Car Park And Leave It There Until We Left Llandudno Never Found It Cheaper On Past Visits By Booking Direct By Phone Or Walking In On Arrival Day.,,,,,
,63,Some Of The Waiting Staff At Breakfast Were A Little Abrupt.,,,,,
,64,Some Of The Breakfast Waiting Staff Were Slightly Abrupt At Times.,,,,,
,68,We Have Eaten With You And Used The Swimming Pool On Previous Visits  Both Most Enjoyable,,,,,
,69,The Lounge Seating Is Not Good Worsened By Non- Residents.Needs Redesign  But Not Easy.,,,,,
,71,My Address Is 30... And Not 30A,,,,,
,72,As We Said Before Keep Up The Standard  Thank You For A Lovely Stay At Christmas Looking Forward To New Year.,,,,,
,73,May Consider Staying With You Again But Would Certainly Upgrade To A Better Bedroom If We Could Afford It.,,,,,
,74,We Have Made A Provisional Booking For Next Xmas  And Will Likely Be Visiting Your Hotel Again Through  The Year,,,,,
,76,We Were Delighted With The Gifts We Received From The Hotel.  The Christmas Crackers Were Of Very High Standard. Providing Gluten Free Food Made A Big Difference Including Christmas Cake  Winning The Guess The Weight Of The Cake Was A Big Bonus  Especially As It Gives Us £50 Off Our Next Visit.,,,,,
,78,Very Enjoyable Stay,,,,,
,82,Congratulations On Your Recent Aware.  Well Deserved.,,,,,
,83,A Big Thank You To All The Staff A Holiday That Was Needed And Will Be Remembered ,,,,,
,88,I Would Not Normally Bother With Questionnaires Like This  But We See The Imperial As A Nice Restful Place To Visit And We Would Like To Keep Coming Back. That's Why I've Completed These Questions. Please View My Comments As Positives Not Negatives.,,,,,
,90,No.,,,,,
,96,No  Just Carry On With The Good Work,,,,,
,97,The Gerberas On The Dining Room Tables Were Dying Or Dead Which Isnt  Very Up Lifting . Towards The End Of Our Stay,,,,,
,98,The Hotel Is Way Above Others In Llandudno But Getting The Little Things Right Really Matters Too.  Hard Boiled Poached Egg Is Easily Identifiable And Should Not Have Left The Kitchen. ,,,,,
,103,We Think Mr Lofthouse Runs A Very Good Hotel,,,,,
,104,Yes  Waste Of Time After Filling In The Hotel Questionnaire. Please Keep A Record Of Who Has Done This!  I First Stayed 65 Years Ago; A Regular Since.  Why Was Hot Water Gone At 8 A.M.?,,,,,
,105,You Need A Bigger Car Park. Or A Car Park Attendant ,,,,,
,106,All Being Well   We Hope To Visit Again Soon ,,,,,
,111,No,,,,,
,112,No,,,,,
,115,No,,,,,
,116,We Enjoyed The Stay And The Gala Dinner For News Years Eve It Was A Good Experience For Us And One We Will Repeat In The Future ,,,,,
,119,We Sincerely Hope That The Management And Staff Continue To Provide The Standards Of The Imperial.,,,,,
,122,Gratefull To Restaurant Manager Putting Our Table Close To Door For New Year Party Easy Access For David With His Walking Wheels.,,,,,
,126,We Have Booked 2 Rooms For 31St January And 1St February And Are Very Much Looking Forward To Another Stay At The Hotel.,,,,,
,127,No,,,,,
,129,We Mentioned That We Liked A  Certain Champagne To Mr. Lofthouse And The Next Day He Had Got Some In For Us. Very Good Service.,,,,,
,130,As I Said Above The Provision Of A Real Bitter Ale Would Make The Imperial Experience Perfect!,,,,,
,131,It Would E Nice To Be Asked To Sign The Dinner Bill After Dinner So We Are Sure There Is No Mistake With Drinks Order,,,,,
,133,Needs Larger Car Park,,,,,
,134,Keep Up The Good Work !!,,,,,
,136,Look Forward To The Next Time,,,,,
,139,Please Maintain The High Standards That Make This Our Hotel Of Choice - Not Just In Llandudno But In Britain.,,,,,
,140,I Have Stayed On Several On Several Occasions And Enjoyed Them All  However I Have Never Eaten In The Evening As I Find Your Prices Very Expensive.,,,,,
,142,There Was A Very Annoying Incident Over My Account.  My Party (4 Adults And 1 Infant) Stayed For Three Nights (27 - 30 December).  It Was Only By Chance That I Learned That You Had An Offer On The Sunday Night.  This Was Not Mentioned To Me At Any Time By Any Of The Staff.  My Account Showed The Same Price For All Three Nights.  It Was Only When I Queried The Sunday Menu Price Compared With The Allowance Shown On My Confirmation That This Was Disclosed And The Account Was Amended.  I Do Feel You Have A Duty To Customers To Ensure That They Benefit From Your Offers And I Was Really Disappointed That I Was Not Informed In Advance.,,,,,
,145,No,,,,,
,150,We Are Back Here Now ,,,,,
,157,We Have Celebrated Christmas At The Imperial Hotel Between 2008 And 2012  And Not Received A Feedback Form. We Were Unable To Attend For The 2013 Celebrations  So I Can Only Comment On Past Years. If You Still Require Comments  Please Contact Me Again. ,,,,,
,158,Gongratulations On Providing A Very Pleasant Experience,,,,,
,162,Perhaps The Back Entrance From The Car Park Up To The Reception Area Could Be Brightened Up A Little. There Was A Feeling Of "Upstairs Downstairs" About It. Sorry.,,,,,
,163,No,,,,,
,164,Look Forward To Our Next Stay As We Visit Several Times During The Year. It Sometimes Feels Like Home From Home!,,,,,
,166,Just Keep Up The Same Standards For Our Next Visit  Hopefully We Will See You In April For Our Wedding Anniversary And Certainly Next Christmas,,,,,
,168,No,,,,,
,170,My Mother Is Counting The Days To Our Return In June!,,,,,
,180,I Always Reccomend To Anyone I Know Who Visits The Area ,,,,,
,182,Thank You.,,,,,
,184,Thanks For A Lovely Stay. Do You Do Any Offers Or Single Travellers That Include Nice Rooms? I Would Come Back On My Own If So,,,,,
,186,Very Happy And Will Be Returning Again.,,,,,
,200,Excellent Hotel Very Comfortable Lovely Staff Well Done,,,,,
,201,Although The Staff Are Efficient I Think The Could Engage A Little Bit More And Smile A Lot More. Have Been Coming To The Imperial For Over 20 Years And Will Try For Another 20 Years.,,,,,
,205,Car Parking A Problem And This Was When You Were Very Quiet,,,,,
,210,No. But Love To Come Back Soon  Love The Afternoon Teas Cucumber Sandwiches.  ,,,,,
,211,None - Looking Forward To Returning,,,,,
,213,Hope To Be Back Very Soon!,,,,,
,216,No.,,,,,
,219,Would Like To Be Notified Of Any Special Weekend Offers As Me And My Wife Would Like To Visit More Times During The Year.,,,,,
,223,None,,,,,
,224,I Will Make A Comment On Trip Adviser,,,,,
,226,I Have Stayed In The St George's Previously But I Would Now Look At You As My 1St Option,,,,,
,228,I Answered Number 19 As 'Met' Our Expectations As We Always Know We Will Have A Good Stay.,,,,,
,230,The Restaurant Staff Were Excellent And It Was Nice People Dressed Up In The Evening  Nice To See The Restaurant Has Standards  The Younger Male Bar/ Waiter Staff Members On The Sunday Need To Communicate Better And Not Air Their Differences Or Disputes In Public ,,,,,
,239,We Liked The View From The Room,,,,,
,240,I Like The Large Rooms.
I Find That I Am Normally Able To Work Quite Happily In My Room Because The Desk Provided Is Of A Suitable Size And Height.  (This Is Not True Of Some Other Hotels In Llandudno.)  Being Able To Work In My Room Is Very Important To Me.
There Was A Muddle On Checking Out As Reception Staff Had Confused Me With Another Guest.  (Possibly A Muddle In The Room Boking System?)
I Find The Hotel Is Convenient For Parking.  I Can Usually Get Parked On One Of The Two Streets Adjacent To The Hotel.  (I Have Never Actually Used The Hotel's Own Car Park.),,,,,
,244,Thanks For A Very Enjoyable Visit,,,,,
