,21,Disappointing Room Which Had The Worst Bathroom We Have Ever Had In Any Hotel Around The World. Secondly  But Not Unimportantly  The Noise Factor Was Atrocious. I Had Asked For A Room With Very Little Noise And Was Assured It Would Be Fairly Quiet By The Young Day Who Took My Booking... She Was So Wrong And We Were Unable To Sleep In At All. The Noise From The Traffic Was Very Loud  As Were The Footsteps From Above Us  Plus The Squeaky Floorboards In The Corridor. We Found Out That Most Of The Rooms Have Been Upgraded And They Did Look Very Nice. I Paid More For A 'Suite' That Was Not So Sweet! The Hotel Is Very Charming And We Think Your Restaurant Is Outstanding And I Have Been Recommending It To Several People In London  But Sadly Not Your Hotel Rooms After Our Experience. ,,,,
,45,It May Seem Odd To Indicate An Overall Experience As Fair  But Unfortunately An Excellent Stay In The Alder Suite (Room 2 From Recollection) Was Tainted By A Relatively Last-Minute Experience. As Ever The Staff Were Extremely Attentive  The Restaurant (Hotel Plus Monty's) Pleasurable  But On The Morning Of Departure I Discovered  What Can Best Be Described As An Accumulation Of Several Months Worth Of Dust In The Room. Please Be Assured That In No Way Am I A Hotel Inspector Or Someone Who Is Likely To Post An Adverse Comment On A Travel Experience Website  But I Feel Compelled To Advise You Of My Experience  As I Would Certainly Like To Continue Use Of A Hotel Which I Rate Highly.   Rather Jokingly On The Morning Of Mine / My Wife's Departure On The 13Th December I Ran My Finger Along A Relatively Short Section Of The Picture Rail  Which Certainly Was Dusty  But Not Excessively. I Remarked To My Wife That I Would Look On Top Of The Wardrobe. To My Horror There Was A Considerable Build Up Of Dust  Certainly Not Explained By It Being Overlooked In Recent Weeks  More Likely Several Months / Years Even. Additionally  There Was On Top Of The Wardrobe  One White (Originally) Sports Sock.  I Would Invite You At Your Earliest Convenience To Visit The Room And Take A Look. I Would Welcome Your Response.  Kind Regards,,,,
,71,The Room We Were In (22) Was Very Small And Is Next To The Service Corridor.  This Meant It Was A Very Noisy Room Especially Early In The Mroning  Around 530Ish And The Night Of New Years Eve When The Staff Were Claering The Main Resturant For The Next Day.  There Is Nowhere To Put Anything In The Room And It Is Difficult To Get Ready In Such Cramped Conditions. The Breakfast Service Was Very Poor....There Is No Point In Bringing 3 Danish Pastries And One Rack Of Toast To A Table Of 4.  This Should Be Obvious To The Serverers But They Seemed A Little Put Out When We Asked For Some Extra Pasties.  The Overal Service At Breakfast Was Not Great.  Dinner Service However Was Excellent. If You Are Looking To Improve The Standard Of The Hotel I Would Definatly Look At This Bedroom.  It Is Probably More Suited As A Single Or A Reduction On The Rack Rate.  I Would Also Look At The Breakfast Service. Also It Would Be Nice If Nuts/Olives Were Offered With Drinks In The Bar Area.  You Are Charging A Fair Premium And I Would Expect This As A Matter Of Course In A 5 Star Establishment.,,,,
,162,It Was Nice But Service In Restaurant Was So Slow,,,,
,240,Unfortunately We Slept Extremely Badly As A) Room Was Far Too Hot And We Couldn't Turn Off The Heated Towel Rail In The Bathroom B) The Room Was Affected By Road Noise Which Kept Us Awake C) There Was A Very Bright Light Immediately Outside The Window From The Hotel Sign And We Had To Keep The Curtains Open To Try And Get Some Breeze And D) A Wedding Group Returned About 1.30Am And And Made Noise On The Gravel Outside Our Window!! (We Are Not Bad Sleepers I Promise!),,,,
,284,Great Restaurant-(Reason We Booked) .Breakfast Also Very Good. Gardens Lovely.. 
Such A Pity We Had A Room At The Front On A Sweltering Night And There Wasn't Even A Fan!
We Needed The Window Wide Open And The Traffic And Activity In The Street Were Very Noisy 
This Really Spoiled Our Experience. A Great Shame.,,,,

,21,Arrival Staff Were Excellent Your Staff Are Friendly And Helpful To The Best Of Their Ability  However They Could Brush Up On Recommendations Of Things To Do In The Region. I Get The Feeling They Have A Few Stock Local Attractions To Send Everyone To  But Beyond That Are Not So Well Informed. More Accurate Knowledge Of Walks In The Area  Both In The New Forest And The Beach Would Be Good. I Really Think Your Hotel Could Be Even Better And It Seems You Are On The Way There. I Think It Is Just Unfortunate Our Room Was Disappointing. The Bathroom In The Walnut Room Is Run Down  Gets Completely Wet With Steam And The Shower Leaks Water Onto The Floor. The Blind Had A Hole In It And The Paintwork Was Shoddy. It Also Was Very Cold! ,,,,

,21,We Rate It As A Two Michelin Star Restaurant! Congratulations To The Chef And Restaurant Staff For A Memorable Evening.,,,,
,71,These Comments In Question 14 Relate To Dinner Only.  Breakfast Quality Was At Best Averagefood Not Especailly Well Cooked On New Years Day.  Bacon Was Very Bad On Both Days  Hard And With Very Little Taste.  Breakfast Service Was Poor And We Felt We Were Troubling The Staff.  Again Some Thougt Should Be Given To Larger Tables In The Number Of Pastries On Toast Served,,,,
,162,Service Was Slow,,,,
,316,The Staff In The Restaurant On The Night Were Very Enthusiastic And Professional. Excellent Service.  Particulary The Chap On The Cheese - He Was Very Engaged With Is Role And Provided Excellent Recommendation.  However  We Were Disappointed With The Tasting Menu - We Felt It Wasn't Very Well Constructed.  Cauliflower Was A Key Feature Of The First Two Courses And We Had Two Shell Fish Courses As Opposed To 1 Shellfish And One Fish.  We Had Also Had Better Cooked Duck   The Deserts Were Excellent And The Cheese Exemplary.  I Asked For Fresh Mint Tea - But Was Told Only Mint Tea Bags Were Available Which I Was Surprised At As Most Fine Dining Restaurants Would Have Had Fresh Mint Available.  The Wine And Wine Service Was Excellent.  ,,,,
,321,I Did Not Appreciate Being Charged £40.00 For A Glass Of Pino Gringo -The Price Apparently For A Bottle !!!,,,,

,21,A Better Room,,,,
,71,Space In The Room 22 To Place Our Belongings Perhaps A Chair Would Have Helped (Although There Was No Room For A Chair). Better Breakfast Items Service And Quality,,,,
,284,Put A Fan In The Room,,,,
,316,We Had A Breakfast That Was A Little Uncomfortable And Made Me  In Particular  Feel That I Was An Inconvenience.  I Understand We Arrived Following A Difficult Morning With A Wedding Party Occupying Lots Of Areas Of The Breakfast Room Not Intended For Them.  However  We Were Not Met At The Door  Had To Wait To Be Noticed.  Nothing Was Explained To Us About This Issue Until Some Way In To Breakfast.  We Sat And Waited At A Dirty Table For Some Time And Had To Wave To Be Noticed.   We Had To Ask A Number Of Times For Service  Menu  Butter For The Table Etc.  I  Heard Many People In The Morning Complaining To The Staff.  Eventually The Staff Did Come Around And Explain The Issue But Then Proceeded To Do This Twice.  I  Don't Believe Anybody Minds If Things Are Difficult Because Of An Unforeseen Issue.  However  I Feel We Could Have Been Better Managed By The Staff On The Day.  Maybe We Could Have Waited In The Conservatory With A Coffee Whilst They Got Everything Set Up And Together.  That All Said  Once It Arrived  The Breakfast Was Excellent And The Staff Did Apologise..  It Was All Just The Crisis Management  When It Was In Full Flow That Let It Down.  ,,,,
,321,At Breakfast I Ordered Decaffeinated Coffee  Which When Brought By A Differen Waitress Proved Not To Be. If I Hadnot Queried It I Could Have Been Quite I'll As I Am Very Sensitive To Even Small Amounts Of Caffein.  Also  My Wife Ordered Grapefruit Juice Which Did Not Arrive Until We Had Reminded The Waitress Of The Order Some Half An Hour Later.,,,,

,71,Most Of The Team Were Very Good However We Were Disappionted With Our Stay As A Group.  We Had Expected A High Standard In All Areas.  We Apprecaite That This Is A Work In Progress. But Wuld Suggest You Look At The Rooms Especailly 22 With Some Urgency And Look At Breakfast Service. I Have Already Written To You Regarding These Comments.,,,,
,316,Beautiful Building And Setting Location  Fabulous Gardens.  Well Appointed Rooms.  Many Excellent Elements Of Service And Some Aspects Not To The Standard I Would Expect.,,,,
