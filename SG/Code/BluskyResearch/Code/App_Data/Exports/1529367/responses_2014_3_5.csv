For More Information Please Visit Http://Www.Symanteccloud.Com ____ I Did Not Enjoy The Food Which I Found Much Too Fussy. The Presentation Was So Artistic It Was Hard To Establish Just What Was On The Fork.Also The Chef Uses Far Too Much Salt.And Why Must Meat Be So Rare.My Preference Is Always For Good Plain English Cooking With A French Twist.Even The Connaught Grill Is Reverting To To This After Several Years Of Nouveau- Diners Usually Express Joy But After One Experience So Often Did Not Come Back. In Making These Comments It Is Fair To Say That The Other Members Of The Buck's Club Shoot Were Delighted With The Food!  ______________________________________________________________________,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Exceeded,Food!,Will Be Back,Male,65+,Special Offers,Accommodation,,,,,,,Patrick ,
