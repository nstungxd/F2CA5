,----------------------,,,,,,,
,1,We Think That The Room Should Have Had A Tea Tray So That We Could Make Our Own Morning Tea. Ringing Down For Tea Might Be Acceptable At 5* Hotels In London  But It Feels Very Outdated In 2013 In Our View. We Do Know How To Make Our Own!,,,,,,
,2,Suite 5 - Truly Excellent. Beautifully Decorated And Very Comfortable Bed. Purely As Constructive Criticism  Bath Robes Would Have Been A Nice Additional Touch.,,,,,,
,6,The Bathroom Looked A Little Bare. For A Non Standard Room I Would Have Expected Dressing Gowns  Slippers And More Products.,,,,,,
,7,Disapointed There Was No Hospitality Tray- Its Great To Be Able To Make A Cup Of Tea Etc,,,,,,
,10,No Tea And Coffee Making Facilities That Were Complimentary,,,,,,
,11,Unfortunately There Was An Unpleasant Smell On The Landing Outside Of Our Bedroom.  It Was As If Someone Had Cleaned Using A Dirty Mop Or Cloth.  We Both Found It Rather Off-Putting On Arrival.  For This Reason I Can't Give You The Room Or Hotel Full Marks.,,,,,,
,12,A Little Dark.,,,,,,
,13,I Thought The Suite Of Rooms Was Very Expensive For What It Was - Basically A Small Corridor To The Toilet,,,,,,
,14,No Mini Bar - So No Wine Or Champagne Glasses In Room Asked For Ice Bucket And Got A Bucket With Water And 3 Ice Cubes In It,,,,,,
,18,Unfortunately The Inside Air Temperature Was Above 30C Which One Small Fan Could Do Nothing About.... Room 43 With Dsash Window As Wide As Possible Was Worse Than The Black Hole Of Calcutta (As Mentioned To Staff On Check-Out). This Is Unfortunate As In All Other Aspects The Hotel Was Excellent And Friendly,,,,,,
,22,There Was A 30Mm Tear In The Bottom Sheet  However This Was Minor For Us.,,,,,,
,27,28.  These Suggestions Would Take Our Experience From Good To Great.  The Ironing Board Being Removed Or At Least Put Away Following Our Room Being Cleaned.  Luxurious Bath Products Being Made Available  We Loved The Bath And Bathroom  Some Lovely Bubble Bath Would Have Made This Perfect.  Also Robe And Slippers Would Have Been A Nice Final Touch.,,,,,,
,31,Beautifully Appointed And Decorated  Impressed By The Size And Quality.,,,,,,
,32,The Suite Is Lovely - The Little Living Room Is Sweet But Sort Of Lacks Character A Bit.,,,,,,
,36,The Toilet Smelt Strongly If Urine.,,,,,,
,37,Room A Bit Dark. Though Room Could Be Brighter Paintwork,,,,,,
,39,Room42-Tap In Bathroom Very Noisy And Pressure Too High.,,,,,,
,40,Chair Ripped And Beams Were Dusty,,,,,,
,42,Room 33. The Refusal Of The 'Dressing-Table' Mirror To Remain Upright Detracts From The Appearance Of The Room.,,,,,,
,44,Room A Bit Dusty Around Tv With Glass Mark On The Glass Top To Tv. Body Lotion Would Have Been Good In The Bathroom To. When We Booked We Did Not Ask For The 'Disabled' Room And Would Really Have Preferred Not To Have That.  The Room Was However Fine And As It Was Only One Night Perfectly Adequate But Not Quite The Real Luxury What I Was Expecting.,,,,,,
,46,Unfortunately We Were In England During A Rare Heatwave.  As A Result We Found The Room A Little Warm.,,,,,,
,48,Room 43 - For The Price Paid There Should Be Tea/Coffee Facilities In Room. 2 Dirty Glasses Were Not Removed Or Replaced During Our 2 Nights Stay. A Dirty Tray Of Crockery Was Left Outside Suite Next To Our Room For 24 Hours.,,,,,,
,50,Room Was Quite Squashed  With 2 People In  One Of You Was Always In The Way.  Room Very Hot Even With The Window Open.,,,,,,
,51,Would Have Liked Tea/Coffee In Room  Room Far To Hot Even With Window Wide Open  No Means Of Cooling It Down.,,,,,,
,52,I Didn't Stay The Night Only Had Lunch,,,,,,
,53,The Room Was At The Top Of The Hotel And Not The Standard Of Room I Felt I Reserved.,,,,,,
,54,A Little Cold On Entry.,,,,,,
,56,I Was Surprised To Find That Tea/Coffee Making Facilities Were Not Provided. It Was Easy To Order Hot Drinks For Room-Service But The Convenience Of Being Able To Make Ones Own Was Missed.,,,,,,
,57,The Staff Offered Tea And Coffee In The Room But I Do Enjoy Having My Own Kettle So That I Can Have A Drink Whenever I Would Like.,,,,,,
,63,I Was Surprised To Be Given A Very Small Room Not In The Hotel But In A Dull  Drab Room On The Street Which Was Very Noisey. The Bed Was Not A Divan And Was Extremely Uncomfortable  The State Of The Bathroom Was Deplorable.,,,,,,
,65,Room 29  (Mallard) Lamp On Desk Needed The Bulb Changing  Not Working  And The Radiator In The Bedroom Was Only Just Warm.,,,,,,
,68,We Stayed In Room 42 And We Disappointed To Find That The Sheet On The Bed Had A Hole In And Was Stained. That,,,,,,
,69,It Was Shame There Were No Tea/Coffee Making Facilities In The Room (Which Considering The Cost Should Be Included). Also  There Was No Information Card/Booklet On The Hotel Telling Me About Breakfast/Check In Times Or Details Of What To Call For Reception. I Had To Call Reception Via My Own Mobile To Find Out Information! Plenty Of Info Re. The Local Area Was Available Though.,,,,,,
,70,Whilst We Appreciate The Building Is Very Old  The Furnishings In The Room Were Very Tired Looking And The Room Was Very Dark & Slightly Opressive. However  The Bed Linen Was Pristine And The Bed Itself  Very Comfortable,,,,,,
,72,Would Have Preferred To Stay In The Main Building,,,,,,
,73,There Were 3 Of Us In Suite Number 3 And I Got The 'Sofa Bed' - This Could Have Done With A Matress Topper As Really Quite Uncomfortable For An Adult. But Everything Else Just Lovely - A Real Home From Home.,,,,,,
,76,I Think I Was Suite 4.  It Was Very Hot And Wifi Very Patchy Which Isn't Great Nowadays And Considered Upacceptable By My International Delegates. Products In The Bathroom Have Disappontedly Changed To Something I Don't Recognise From Molton Brown.  They Are Not Replenished By Cleaning Staff When They Clean Each Day.  Ditto The Flannels  The Same One Is Left To Dry Out And No New Ones Put In - In 5 Days Of Staying There.,,,,,,
,77,Some Body Moisturiser Would Have Been Good,,,,,,
,78,The Room Was Charming Very Well Appointed. I Especially Liked The Selection Of Still And Sparkling Water.,,,,,,
,79,Suite 3: It Would Have Beem Convenient To Have A Free Plug Socket Near The Bed Or A Table For Phone Charging,,,,,,
,80,No  It Was Fine,,,,,,
,81,Suite 4. Excellent,,,,,,
,82,Room 43,,,,,,
,83,Room 43,,,,,,
,85,Loved The Bedside Light / Table Combo's,,,,,,
,86,The Room Was Ok  But I Would Not Describe It As 'Luxurious'.  Having To Walk Outside To Get To It Was Not Ideal  And In The Morning We Discovered That The Secondary Double Glazing Was Not Properly Closed On 3 Of The Panes  Letting Noise In Over-Night. The Turn-Down Service (If That's What It Was) Seemed Odd - On The First Night The Blanket On The Bed Was Removed  But Nothing Else Seemed To Have Been Done.  The Second Night Nothing Happened At All.  Only 1 Shower Gel Was Provided For 2 People For 2 Nights(!) And When The Toilet Roll Ran Out  The Spare Was Not Replaced.,,,,,,
,88,We Stayed With You For Three Nights During Which No Bathroom Products Were Replaced.  Also Would Strongly Suggest The Provision Of A Bath Mat For Use Whilst Showering As The Bath Was Very Slippery.,,,,,,
,89,All Good But Would Suggest A Bath Mat For Use In The Bath When Showering As Bath Was Very Slippery!,,,,,,
,90,We Were There For Three Nights  During This Time No Bathroom Products Were Replaced.,,,,,,
,93,It Was Too Hot During The Night!,,,,,,
,96,A Mini-Bar And Facilities For Making A Hot Drink Would Be Beneficial. The Bathroom Heating Was On In The Afternoon But It Was Cold In The Morning,,,,,,
,97,Upper Level Room. Rooms Were Quite Dark  It Was Very Hot And No Air Conditioning  One Sash Window To Let In Any Air. Had To Ask For A Fan. Which Was Provided.,,,,,,
,102,Would Have Liked Tea-Making Facilities In The Room And A Fridge.,,,,,,
,104,It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Kettle (For Hot Water And Hot Water Bottle!).,,,,,,
,105,Would Have Been Nice To Have Tea/Coffee Making Facilities.,,,,,,
,106,We Were Shown To Room 32 - Excellent. However  Due To An Awful Visiting Funfair We Had To Be Re-Assigned To A Quieter Room.  Room 14 Was A Lower Standard Room And Much Smaller.  Also  While We Could Not Hear The Funfair Noise There Was The Constant Humming From The Kitchen Fans  Just Beneath The Windows  Which Woke Me Up Early The Next Morning.,,,,,,
,107,The Room Layout Was Poor/Inefficient. The Bathrooom Ceiling Leaked And Flooded The Room.,,,,,,
,110,We Had Booked In As 3 People 2 Parents And Child And Provided With One Set Of Bath Products !,,,,,,
,111,We Stayed In The Courtyard Room. On Reflection I Would Prefer To Be In The Main Part Of The Hotel.,,,,,,
,117,Tea And Coffee Should Be Available In The Room.  Some Dust.,,,,,,
,120,Would Have Preferred To Have Tea And Coffee Making Facilities Within The Room,,,,,,
,121,Room 29 - A Very Long Climb To The Room  Fortunately We Are Reasonably Fit But Others Might Find It Difficult!      Also We Would Have Liked A Room Directory (As In Other Hotels) Giving Reception Phone Number And An Example Of Menus Available In The Restaurant.,,,,,,
,122,The Bathroom Was A Bit Of A Problem - The Plug In The Bath Had To Be Leavered Out The Next Morning By A Staff Member So That We Could Have A Shower.  Apparently A Known Problem.  The Curtain In The Bathroom Couldn't Be Closed  Which Was A Little Uncomfortable And Was Coming Off The Railing.  And The Table Lamp Wasn't Working Either And Nor Was It Fixed For The Second Night.,,,,,,
,125,We Had To Ask For Bathrobes Which We Had Expected To Find In Our Suite.,,,,,,
,126,It Was Dark And Rather Depressing. The Temperature Was Unbearably Hot.,,,,,,
,127,The Shower Head Needed To Be Cleaned.,,,,,,
,139,Room 43 The Bathroom Is Quite Small And Whilst Using The Wash Hand Basin The Bathroom Door Is Constantly Hitting You On The Back.,,,,,,
,140,We Were Given Very Top Of Hotel And Those Stairs Are Terrible,,,,,,
,141,Would Prefer To Have Been Told At The Time Of Makiong The Reservation That The Room Allocated Had A Disabled Ensuite,,,,,,
,143,A Lovely Room But Difficult For Both Of Us To Climb 2 Flights Of Awkward Stairs. Unfortunately The Ambience Of The Room Was Spoilt By The Droning Of The Extracter Fans From The Kitchen. We Were Told They Would Be Switched Off By Midnight But Sadly The Noise Continued All Night And I Hardly Slept - Even After Trying Earplugs !  Would Not Stay In Room 14 Again !,,,,,,
,144,Room 55: Stairs Awkward With Luggage,,,,,,
,145,Room 55: Stairs Quite Difficult With Luggage!,,,,,,
,146,It Was Incredibly Hot In Our Room - Had To Have The Window Open Which Meant We Heard All The Recycling Bins Being Picked Up Very Early In The Morning Which Was Very Loud!,,,,,,
,147,We Were Upgraded To Wren Suite Because There Had Been A Mix Up With The Superior Room We Had Booked.It Was A Nice Suite But I Would Have Been Disappointed If We Had Paid Top Rate For This Room.Thought The Lighting Was Insufficient And A Bit Gloomy And The Separate Lounge Area Was Not Particularly Welcoming. The Bathroom Was Very Nice But I Would Have Liked A Curtain On The Window As I Felt A Little Exposed When The Light Was On And Wasn't Entirely Sure If You Could See In From Outside. While The Room Was Very Clean  The Area  Between The Back Of The Toilet Seat And The Lid Was Dirty And I Found This Off Putting. I Would Have Liked To Have Completed A Customer Satisfaction Form But I Didn't Spot One In The Room.,,,,,,
,149,Having Seen The Photos Of The Rolltop Bath We Had Expected One And Was A Little Disappointed On Arrival But Our Room Was Lovely Still! We Were In Suite 2,,,,,,
,151,See My Comments Re Room14,,,,,,
,154,The Room Itself Was Good However As It Was Over The Reception. I Was Awoken At 6:30Am By The Reception Staff Either On The Phone Or Dealing With Other Staff.  So Great Hotel But It Really Depends On What Room You Get.  To Put It In Context  We Were Away For The Weekend Without Our Son For The First Time In 5 Years And Were Really Looking Forward To A Sleep In.  As It Ended Up We Were First To Breakfast And Probably First To Check Out.,,,,,,
,155,Suite 3. Weren't Expecting Suite Accommodation At Booking So Very Pleased To Stay In Suite 3! Beautiful Room.,,,,,,
,156,Suite 2. It Would Have Been Nice To Have Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room. Whilst Admittedly There Was The Option To Call Reception For Tea And Coffee To Be Brought To The Room  This Seemed A Long-Winded Solution To Get Get A Cup Of Tea.,,,,,,
,160,No Problem But Over Priced,,,,,,
,164,S5 It Was Very Hot!!!,,,,,,
,166,We Were In Room 4 And It Was A Warm Night So We Had The Windows Open.  Unfortunately It Rained So The Noise From The A44 Was Quite Loud - Not Your Fault  But Would Choose A Room At The Back If We Were To Stay Again And Would Recommend Our Friends To Do The Same,,,,,,
,170,Room 33 Is Quite Dark.  Only One Chair In The Room Which Forced One Of Us To Sit On The Bed.  No Seat To Do Make Up And Hair Next To A Mirror Or A Plug Socket For Hairdryer Or Straightners Next To A Mirror Or Seat.  Bathroom Also Not Natural Or Strong Lighting For Make Up Application.,,,,,,
,174,Surprised To Find No Coffee / Tea Making Facilities,,,,,,
,177,We Were A Family Of 4 In One Suite.  Our Bath And Shower Products Were Not Replenished For The 2Nd Day Of Our Stay.  This Appears Somewhat 'Cheap'.,,,,,,
,178,Noisy Water Pump In Bathroom,,,,,,
,179,The Room Was Lovely And Very Relaxing A King Size Bed Would Of Been Preferred As My Partner Is 6Ft 6 So The Bed Frame Was A Little Short,,,,,,
,180,Did Not Use The Accommodation Facilities. You Should Have A N/A Box On Many Of Your Scales.,,,,,,
,181,Suite 5 Bed Was Extremely Comfortable  Windows Very Drafty But Only To Be Expected Considering The Age Of The Property.,,,,,,
,183,My Husband And I Both Found The Room Very Nice But The Pillows Very Disappointing. At A Hotel Of This Standard We Would Always Expect Down Pillows - The Ones On The Bed Were Lumpy And Uncomfortable. We Should Have Asked If It Was Possible To Swap Them  But Didn't Bother In The End. Overall  This Was The Only Flaw In An Otherwise Excellent Visit.,,,,,,
,185,Our Room (25) Was Poorly Decorated And Had Very Tatty Furniture  It Did Not Have Any Infomation Avalible In The Room Ie  Room Service Details  Check Out Etc. No Tea And Coffee Facilities Were Avalible In The Room And We Were Not Told We Could Request Complimentary Tea/Coffee On Our Arrival. Our Phone Did Not Work When We Arrived   However It Was Fixed After Soon After We Reported It.,,,,,,
,186,You Choose Not To Provide Tea & Coffee  Preferring To Send This Up When Required. Our Order After Dinner Was Vey Slow 30Mins Requiring Me To Go Downstairs And Chase  Giving The Impression We Had Been Forgotten. Only Blip With Services But A Shame.,,,,,,
,187,Appeared A Little Warm On Arrival And Once Settled With A Welcoming Pot Of Tea  We  Were Unfortunately Evacuate Due To A Fire In The Hotel! After A Few Hours We Were Able To Return.   I Have To Mention The Extremely Comfortable Bed. We Did Regret That In The Short Time We Had There We Were Not Able To Take Full Advantage Of The Wonderfully Comfortable Bed; Which Was Pure Luxury (Due To The Evac).,,,,,,
,188,The Rooms Are Lovely  But I Would Not Consider Them Luxurious. The Twin Room Was Very Small.,,,,,,
,189,The Bedroom Was Poorly Lit,,,,,,
,190,It Would Be Good To Have The Option Of Tea Making Facilities Whilst There Was A Note Stating That Morning Coffee Was Available To All Guests We Would Have Preferred To Be Able To Make Our Own. In The Bathroom The Option Of A Shower Cap Would Have Been A Blessing.,,,,,,
,191,It's A Minor Thing  I Found The Room To Be Dark And I Prefer Well Lit Rooms.  The Black Lapshades  Don't Help.  I Also Thought The Choice Of Draperies In Suite 2  While Of High Quality  Made The Room Darker By Having Them Joined At The Top Instead Of Having 2 Panels That You Could Separate To Let In Maximum Light During The Day.  On A Repeat Trip I Would Probably Try A Different Room.,,,,,,
,192,Pieces Of Plaster And Paint On Top Of The Bed From The Ceiling  Throughout Early Evening There Was A Great Deal Of Noise/Jumping From The Room Above  Obviously Causing The Plaster On Ceiling To Fall Off. Tea Making Facilities Would Have Been Nice  We Were Offered A Cup Of Tea And Then Charged Â£4 Per Cup For It!,,,,,,
,193,Room 32 - Overall Really Liked It,,,,,,
,194,Beautifully Set And And Scrupulously Clean!,,,,,,
,198,Suite 2  We Were Very Happy To Be Upgraded To This Lovely Suite And It Was Beautifully Clean  Spotless  I Liked The Fact That Your Toiletries Smelt Nice  We Go Away A Lot And They're Usually Always A Very Masculine Scent But Yours Were Nice And Both Me And My Husband Were Happy To Use Them.,,,,,,
,199,Suite 1 The Water Stopped While I Was In The Shower And I Had To Rinse Shampoo Off My Hair In The Sink But Only Boiling Hot Water Was Coming Out. We Were Given Another Room But Nobody Offered To Help Us Move Our Things Which We Had Unpacked. There Is No Kettle In The Room Which Is A Basic Facility ,,,,,,
,204,It Was Extremely Hot Overnight Despite Having The Window Open.Also It Was Noisy With A Lot Of Door Banging About 11.30Pm  Not Sure If This Was Staff Going Through One Of The Private Doors Nearby Or Just Finishing Up For The Night.,,,,,,
,207,29. Tea Making Facilities Should Be In Superior Rooms.,,,,,,
,208,The Bathroom Seemed Quite Cold,,,,,,
,212,The Water Pump Woke Us Up At 7Am And Was Very Disruptive. I Am Heavily Pregnant And Came To The Feathers To Relax And Catch Up On Rest  So This Was Far From Ideal.,,,,,,
,214,42 Exceptional Amount Of Dust Around Scrolls On Furniture. Bathroom  Hand Basin Tap Difficult To Use Without Splashing Water Everywhere.,,,,,,
,215,51 Very Lovely Room,,,,,,
,216,Initially Thought That The Relatively Noisy Ventilation Unit/Extractor Outside Our Room Would Be An Issue  But In The End It Didn't Bother Us. Lovely Room Otherwise.,,,,,,
,217,Suite 3 - Room Was Fine  Bathroom Walls Above The Door Were Dusty. Room Serviced On First Day But No Toiletries Replaced - We Called Reception And They Were Sent Up,,,,,,
,220,4Foot 6Inch Bed Too Small,,,,,,
,222,The Furniture Was Covered In Dust And The Mirrors Left A Lot To Be Desired.,,,,,,
,229,Would Have Appreciated Being Able To Make Tea And Coffee In The Room.,,,,,,
,232,The Bedroom Was Really Hot - We Opened Windows But If You Ever Consider Aircon In The Rooms This Would Be Of Great Benefit.,,,,,,
,233,No,,,,,,
,235,We Stayed In Room 25.  We Liked The Large Bed That Was Very Comfortable.  The Bathroom Was A Bit Small But Well Appointed.  Bath And Shower Excellent.  The Room Was Rather Warm But There Was A Fan Available If We Needed It.  We Were Woken Up Very Early Morning By The Bin Men But It Didn't Spoil Our Stay.,,,,,,
,236,Cobwebs Hanging From The Ceiling Over The Window.  Cobwebs In Window And Coving Over The Door.  Thick Dust On Top Of The Curtains. Bath Had Water In It As Taps Not Able To Be Closed Off Properly.  Childs Medication Left On Mantlepiece Of Fire.  Long Hairs On The Duvet.  Only One Chair To Sit And Relax!  Light In Wardrobe Not Working.  We Found The Bed Uncomfortable And Too Small For A Superior Room.  Pillows Were Too Small And Lumpy And Not Comfortable.  Sparkling Water Had Been Opened And Was Flat.,,,,,,
,239,This Is The Only Hotel I Have Stayed In Which Did Not Provide Free Tea/Coffee Facilities Within The Room And The Absence Of A Mini Bar/Fridge. There Was No Bubble Bath For The Bath  Only Shower Gel.,,,,,,
,244,There Was No Shampoo Provided.  Only Shower Gel And Bubble Bath.,,,,,,
,247,The Mattress On The Bed Was So Uncomfortable That We Both Awoke With Sore Backs.  We Were Awake At 7Am As The People Above Us Were Moving Around The Room A Great Deal And The Ceilings Were Really Creaky!  It Is An Old Building  So Doubt You Can Do Much About That But Definitely Time To Change The Mattress.  We Were Staying In The Ground Floor Outbuilding With The Disabled Access Wet Room.,,,,,,
,248,25 We Would Have Liked Tea Making Facilities. The Jelly Beans Were A Nice Touch  But If Left In The Jar For Any Length Of Time They Do Stick Together And Are Not Accessible. It Would Be A Good Idea To Empty And Refill For Each Booking So That This Does Not Happen.,,,,,,
,253,Suite 3. I Found The Hot Towel Rails Were Unfortunately Far Too High To Be Of Any Use For More Than One Towel,,,,,,
,256,We Would Have Liked A Larger Bed,,,,,,
,257,25 Wifi Would Be A Nice Feature In The Room.,,,,,,
,259,Suite 1. No Hand Cream Or Shower Cap! Sorry To Be Picky!,,,,,,
,263,Bathroom Very Clean. Room A Little Dark.,,,,,,
,264,I Made The Point When We Left That The Hot Water System Had Struggled With The Very Cold Weather To Provide A Hot Bath - It Was Ok In The Basin - And Double-Glazing Might Have Been A Plus!,,,,,,
,265,I Would Have Liked A Shower Cap.  Also  On Of The Blinds Was Broken So It Had To Remain Down All The Time.,,,,,,
,266,We Were In Room 42 And It Was Quite Dark  As There Was Only A Relatively Small Window. Not Much You Can Do With The Room Configuration  But We Prefer Brighter Rooms.,,,,,,
,269,The Ipod Doc On The Bedside Table Did Not Appear To Work. We Did Not Mention It At The Time As It Wasn't Important To Us. The Bottle Collection On The Weds Morning Was Noisy But That Can't Really Be Avoided.,,,,,,
,271,Bed Not As Comfortable As Others In Similar Hotels,,,,,,
,276,Room Was Well Appointed  Comfortable And Clean Although No Coffee / Tea Making Facilities Were Available In The Room.,,,,,,
,277,I Had Read Reports From Customers Who Said They Loved The Jelly Beans In Their Rooms So Dissapointed We Did Not Get Any.,,,,,,
,278,Room Number 32 There Was No Tea Or Coffee Making Facilities However Everything Else Was Excellent,,,,,,
,282,First Room We We're Put In Very Dark And Drab  Up On The Third Floor   Ask To Be Moved   Went To Room 28 Much Better But Bathroom Needed Attention Peeling Paint Work Around Shower   Toilet Seat Stained And Needed Replacing And Two Towel Rails Which Didn't Work  Dressing Table Mirror Needed Repair As It Wouldn't Stay Upright   Do You Not Have A Housekeeper Checking These Things? We Booked On A Sunday Evening Thinking We Would Get A Decent Room   But So Disappointed .,,,,,,
,283,Would Of Liked Hot Drink Making Facilities .,,,,,,
,284,Tea Making Facilities Would Have Been Appreciated,,,,,,
,286,It Was Lovely And The Bottles Of Water And Jelly Beans Were A Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,288,Room Was Very Basic  No Bedside Tables Or Lamps  No Tea/Coffee In Room  Noise From Aircon Units Below  Bed Not Very Comfortable. When I Called For Coffee Sunday Morning It Took 3 Minutes For The Phone To Be Answered,,,,,,
,292,No Coffie Or Tea Im Room,,,,,,
,293,It Was A Sunny Day And The Room Had Become Far Too Hot. Fortunately The Window Opened. However  The Towel Rail In The Bathroom Was Fully On And Seemed Impossible To Turn Down.,,,,,,
,294,Too Amall,,,,,,
,295,Room 24 Stairs Difficult To Negotiate For Elderly,,,,,,
,296,Pre Warn Guests About Location Of Room At App Of House In Case Of Mobility Issues,,,,,,
,297,We Bought Some Friends With Us And Their Room Needed A Chair At The Dressing Table But Otherwise Everything Was O.K.,,,,,,
,302,Oops I Have Already Commented About That!  The Room Was Cleaned But There Were Stains On The Carpet And The Shower Screen In The Bathroom Needed Attention.  The Rubber Seal Needs Replacing.  I Turned The Shower On And Went Back In To Find Water Running Out Onto The Floor.,,,,,,
,303,There Wasn't Any Lotion In Our Room And I Had To Request It.,,,,,,
,305,The Bedside Lamps In Room 25 Are Dangerous. I Toppled One Full Onto My Head  In The Dark  In The Middle Of The Night. My Wife Thought That The Pillows Were Too Soft But Its Personal Opinion.,,,,,,
,310,The Plug In The Bath Didnt Work So We Weren't Able To Use The Bath Which Was A Disappointment.,,,,,,
,312,The Switches For All 3 Table Lamps Were Too Low Down On The Flex.  On The Desk I Had To Crawl Under The Desk To Switch The Light On.  An Electrician Could Move The Switches Nearer To Base Of The Lamp On The Same Flex,,,,,,
,316,Although Clean I Thought That It Was Rather Shabby. One Particularly Small Round Table Needed Attention.  The Bathroom Was Pleasant And I Appreciated The Generous Amount Of Towels Provided.,,,,,,
,317,We Were Given Suite 4 Which Was Fabulous My Partner Likes To Make Her Own Tea. No Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,322,It Would Of Been Nice To Of Had Tea Making Facilities  But Loved The Room,,,,,,
,326,The Armchair Was Wonderfully Comfortable. Two Would Be Better In A Double Room Though.,,,,,,
,328,Lovely - Warm  Stylish  Comfortable. We Had Only 1 Of Everything Of The Products Which Was Less Useful When I Wanted A Bath On The Evening Of Check-In And We Each Had A Shower The Following Morning - We Had Brought Extra Supplies With Us - But Had We Not We Would Have Felt Perfectly Comfortable Asking For More Supplies.,,,,,,
,329,No Tea Making Facility And Could Of Had More Luxurious Bath Room Products Wardrobe Door Difficult To Close. Plus Points Bath Robes Plenty Of Towels And Bed Very Comfortable,,,,,,
,334,Suite 2. My Only Grip Is The Light Intrusion Into The Room  From The Large Gap Under The Door (I Had To Place A Towel On The Floor Against The Door  The Very Bright Standby On The Tv (I Had To Hang A Coat Over The Tv To Cover It And The Glow Coming From The Emergency Escape Sign In The Sitting Room Which I Guess We Have To Live With. It Would Have Been Nice To Have Beverage Facilities In The Room Without Relying On Room Service.,,,,,,
,335,The Room Was Quite Warm. We Opened The Windows But The 'Kitchen Noise 'Woke Us Early Morning.,,,,,,
,338,42 Is A Dark  Gloomy  Poorly-Lit Room. The Bathroom Was Inconvenient  And The Shower Controls Were Confusing.,,,,,,
,340,The Climb Up The Stairs Was A Surprise  We Were More Than Able To Deal With It But If We Had Been Older  Whether Or Not Infirm  It Could Have Been An Issue.  Also Where Ever We Go We Think Could We Have Taken Our Parents And On This Occasion  In This Room The Answer Would Have Been No.  Thats Not A Problem But We Would Have Wanted To Be Aware Of That When Booking.,,,,,,
,341,Suite 5.   The Room Was Not Cleaned Upon Arrival.  We Found A Dirty Towel On The Floor When We Were Shown To The Room.  There Was Evidence Of The Previous Occupant In The Shower  Grit At The Bottom Of The Bathtub  Smears On The Mirror And The Bed Side Cabinets Were Dirty Also.  The Room Was Re-Cleaned   However Even After That We Found Lipstick Marks On The Glasses And Had To Ask For Replacements. Also  When I Moved The Lamp There Was A Black Line Of Dirt Across The Bedside Table  Very Disappointing And Not Acceptable For The Price We Paid.  There Were Lovely Temple Spa Products   But Not Enough Of Them.,,,,,,
,343,I Slept Well,,,,,,
,344,Actually Two Issues. The Amin Issue Was The Location Of The Room Itself (51) On The Ground Floor  At Street Level  Looking Directly Out Onto The Street. I Like To Change My Clothes And Go Out Jogging But Felt Very Inhibited By Having To Strip Off In Full Public View And Net Curtains Are Just Not Opaque Enough.  Second  The Remote Control For The Television Did Not Work.,,,,,,
,347,Room Was Very Cold And No Means Of Controlling The Temperature. Needed An Extra Duvet.,,,,,,
,348,Unfortunately The Bath Plug Was Faulty And The Shower Seemed Blocked At The Tray Filled Up,,,,,,
,350,Suite 4. We Loved The Suite. We Only Wished We Had Book A Longer Stay  To Enjoy The Room More.,,,,,,
,352,Foot Stool Was Filthy!,,,,,,
,353,The Footstool In Bedroom Was Filthy  Not Hoovered At All.,,,,,,
,354,Very Warm Overnight  Even With A Fan (Suite 1).  Would Be A Struggle In The Height Of Summer,,,,,,
,356,No Large Mirror In Bathroom. No Tea And Coffee In Room,,,,,,
,360,Think It Was Room 23.  Disappointingly Small Room And Dark.  Wardrobe Was Abysmal.  Very Cold When We Arrived.,,,,,,
,361,The Lighting Wasnt Great In The Lounge Area Of Suite 2 And We Were Woken At 545Am By Noisy People (Staff?) Who Sounded Like They Were Moving A Beer Barrel,,,,,,
,362,I Have Stayed In The Feathers Many Times Over The Years  But Not Since Your Refurbishment.  These Things Are Very Much A Personal Taste  But I Felt The Facelift Has Lost The Heart Of The Hotel,,,,,,
,365,We Were Located In The Ground Floor Room At The Rear Of The Courtyad And Were A Little Dissapointed There Was No Bath.,,,,,,
,366,Some Cobwebs Visible Above The Bed. Room 25,,,,,,
,369,We Stayed In The Eagle Suite.  We Were Surprised That There Were No Tea/Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.,,,,,,
,370,32 Bedside Lighting Very Difficult To Read By.,,,,,,
,371,Only The Stairs Getting To The Room. The Lady Showing Us To The Room Did Offer A Lower Room But We Declined.,,,,,,
,372,Room 33.  Perhaps A Little Dark  With The Curtains Covering Much Of The Window.  We Also Thought The Bathroom Decor Was Rather Monochrome.,,,,,,
,374,We Really Liked The Separate Sitting Room.,,,,,,
,375,Would Have Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,376,The Blind To The Rear Window Was Left Down As Broken  Therefore Rather Dark. The Room Was Rather Quaint But Acess Was Difficult For 'Mature' People And We Were Not Advised In Advance,,,,,,
,377,Disappointed In Our Room And Found The Bed Small And Not Comfortable Courtyard Room,,,,,,
,380,No Bubble Bath Available.,,,,,,
,382,Room 42 Bad Points: Would Have Liked Some Coffee / Tea Making Facility In Room. The Tap In The Bathroom Was Very Fierce And Sprayed Water All Over You Each Time You Turned It On.,,,,,,
,384,No,,,,,,
,385,Room 33 . Bed Very Comfortable. Would Like To Know The Mattress Type And Brand.,,,,,,
,386,I Wanted Some More Shampoo And Conditioner And I Had To Ask Multiple Times.,,,,,,
,389,As Previously Stated. Soft Furnishings Very Nice And Comfy Bed.,,,,,,
,391,Air Conditioning Needed Desperately In Warm Weather As The Rooms Become Very Stuffy,,,,,,
,392,24. Very Wobbly Headboard - Could Not Move At All Without It Banging On The Wall Behind The Bed.,,,,,,
,395,The Room Was Very Hot And Uncomfortable During This Hot Weather - Perhaps Some Air-Conditioning Should Be Considered?,,,,,,
,396,It Was Too Hot  Unbearable,,,,,,
,401,Cover The Hot Water Pipe In The Floor. Bathroom Excellent When You Figure Out How The Shower Works.,,,,,,
,402,Very Comfortable!,,,,,,
,405,The First Night Was In The Courtyard Room Designed For People With Disabilities And Frankly Disappointing. The Second Night We Were Upgraded To Suite 5 Which Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,409,Room32  Would Have Liked To Have The Facilities Of Tea/Coffee   When Reading The Comments In The Guest Book  Quite A Few Previous Guest Also Made This Comments  Being An Early Riser Would Have Appreciated This  ,,,,,,
,412,The Room Was Extremely Hot. We Had A Fan But This Did Little To Cool The Room. We Stayed During The Recent Really Hot Weather So There Isn't Much Else That Could Have Been Done. Also  Would Be Nice To Have Tea/Coffee Making Facilities.,,,,,,
,413,Room 28  Sash Windows Don't Close Tight  Creating A Draft  Curtains Don't Close Tight Meaning Room Is Very Light.  Extractor Fan In Bathroom Very Loud.,,,,,,
,414,51 I Would Have Expected Bath Robes In A Hotel Such As This,,,,,,
,415,We Loved The Design Of Our Room  However There Were Minor Points That Made It Appear Less Luxurious  In Our Opinion. Those In Questions Are The Pink Alarm Clock With An Ipod Speaker  Gigantic Lamps And Standing Shower That Does Not Drain. In Addition  One Of The Windows Did Not Have A Lock.,,,,,,
,416,Suite 1. Great. Upgraded From A Cotswold Double,,,,,,
,417,Would Have Liked Tea/Coffee Making Facility,,,,,,
,418,A Couple Of Comments About The Room.  We Stayed In The Annex  And Although The Bathroom Was Very Well Decorated It Was  Frankly  Too Small And Cramped And Not What You Would Expect When Paying A Relatively High Price For The Room Secondly  The Absence Of Corporate Feel Was Good  Up To A Point.  However  Not Supplying Tea Making Facilities Was A Mistake. You 'Lost Points' For That.,,,,,,
,421,I Would Have Preferred To Have Had A Room With A Bath.,,,,,,
,422,There Was No Bath.,,,,,,
,428,I Wouldn't Describe It As Luxurious Butit Was Very Nice - Apart From Being Next To A Staircase And Front Door So Had The Upstairs Guests Tramping Upstairs/Downstairs Which Was Very Noisy.,,,,,,
,429,Room In The House Next Door  Just Inside The Front Door  Left.  Sorry Cant Remember The Number.,,,,,,
,434,Room 51 Would Have Prefered A 1St Floor Room. No Tea & Coffee Making Facliaties In The Room,,,,,,
,435,We Stayed With You Before In May 2012 And Had A Fabulous Time  Everything Was Just Perfect And That Is Why We Came Back Again  But This Time We Were Far From Impressed.  We Stayed In Room 14  Where The Bathroom Had Been Shoe-Horned In And The Toilet Seat Was Badly Cracked Which Is Not Only Very Unhygienic But Also Very Uncomfortable As It Pinches Your Flesh When Sitting On It.  There Are No Bedside Tables  To Put Our Water Or Drinks On.  We Ordered Tea To Be Brought To Our Room For 7.00 A.M. And Rang Reception At 7.20 And Nobody Answered The Phone So Had To Ring Again At 7.30 As Still  Nothing Had Been Delivered And Were Told There Was Only 1 Member Of Staff In The Restaurant And They Were Busy.  I Fail To See Why Tee/Coffee Making Facilities Cannot Be Provided In The Rooms.,,,,,,
,436,33 - We Would Like To Have Tea/Coffee Making Facilities In The Room And A Second Chair Would Have Made The Room More Comfortable.,,,,,,
,441,We Stayed In Room 52 And This Was Perfect As We Had Our Labrador With Us....And We Loved The Patio Area!,,,,,,
,442,Room 51  Shame About The Staircase Leading To Upstairs  As All Movement Was Clearly Heard  Although It Is Appreciated That In Older Buildings  This Would Be Difficult To Improve.,,,,,,
,443,It Was Suite 3. It Was Fine - Again We Stay In Amazing Hotels So I Expect A High Standard. Would Have Liked Tea And Coffee In The Room. For A Suite You Might Consider Upgrading To Better Toiletries?,,,,,,
,444,No Bubbles For The Lovely Bath - Just Shower Gel - Not The Same!!,,,,,,
,447,No Bedside Tables To Put A Night Time Water On. Also One Of The Bottles Of Complimentary Water Was Labelled Still Yet Was Carbonated.,,,,,,
,449,Suite 1 1. We Weren't Able To Watch One Of The Dvd's We Borrowed As I Couldn't Change The Channel On The Tv To The Hdmi Av Input - The 'Tv/Av' Button Simply Didn't Work! I Tried All Manor Of Things But Eventually Had To Give Up. I Might Have Been A Numpty And Pressed All The Wrong Buttons But Consider Myself Reasonably Tech Savvy So Sincerely Hope This Wasn't The Case.   2. The Extractor Fan In The Bathroom Was Particularly Noisy  Probably Just Needs A Clean But Either Way It Certainly Didn't Contribute To A Nice Relaxing Soak In The Bath!,,,,,,
,451,Suite 1 - The Shower Was Rather Weak. Would Have Expected A Power Shower At This Standard Of Hotel.,,,,,,
,452,Our Bedroom Was Fine But Our Friends In 24 Had No Cross Ventilation And It Was Very Hot. The Rooms 23 And 24 Were Nice But Very Expensive For Their Size.,,,,,,
,453,A Pile Of Dirty Towels Had Been Left On The Chair When We Came Back To Our Room In The Evening,,,,,,
,455,Heated Towel Rail Not Working No Shower Gel Or Shampoo Just Soap Staff Getting Up At 6.00Am Noisy And Woke Us Up Only One Dressing Gown Which Was Too Small,,,,,,
,458,The Water In Our Room Wasn't Hot When I Complained To Reception They Upgraded Us To A Suite With No Quibble Excellent Service,,,,,,
,467,The Bath Wasnt Perfectly Clean But The Most Disappointing Were The Products For Going Away Means A Relaxing Bath With Nice Products Which I Expect A Hotel Like Yours To Provide. You Have A Good Brand In The Ladies Room In The Restaurant And I Think They Should Be In The Rooms.Secondly We Had A Real Problem With The Bed  Every Time You Moved It Made A Noise We Reported It In The Morning And I Do Hope You Look Into That Because It Would Put Us Off Returning,,,,,,
,474,Partridge  I Think.  It Would Be Nice To Be Able To Blow Dry Hair In Front Of A Well Lit Mirror.,,,,,,
,477,We Stayed In Suite 3 - Unfortunately As A Result Of Your Kitchen Staff Talking Until 11.30Pm And A Piece Of Black Metal Sheet Near The Fire Escape Banged All Night (Because It Was Windy) The Person Sleeping On The Sofa Bed Did Not Sleep At All Well.,,,,,,
,478,No,,,,,,
,481,Generally Very Clean! But On Entering The Room You Foul See That Under The Bed Was A Layer Of Dust.,,,,,,
,482,There Was Some Dust Under The Bed On Entering The Room  However  Very Good Otherwise.,,,,,,
,486,Too Hot - And We Had Difficulty Turning Off The Bathroom Radiator,,,,,,
,489,Tiny Bit Small With Extra Bed In And Because Of Hot Weather We Needed The Windows Open So Collection Of Bottles Early On Wed Morning Was Very Noisy,,,,,,
,493,Suite 1. Sympathetically Decorated - Extremely Nice!,,,,,,
,494,Our Dog Was Chuffed That She Even Had Her Own Bed - We Needn't Have Brought Hers !!,,,,,,
,498,The Room Did Not Have A View - Overlooked Working Areas,,,,,,
,500,Stayed In Room 43  Bathroom V Compact.Room On A Slant And Bed Rather Uncomfortable.,,,,,,
,502,Wi Fi Access In The Rooms Please,,,,,,
,506,We Stayed In Suite 3 And It Was Wonderful. Lovely Soft Bedding And Lots Of Space To Relax.,,,,,,
,511,I Found Someone Else's Hair In Bathroom And I Think The One Bathrobe Had Been Used .,,,,,,
,512,29 Mallard. This Is An Honest Account And I Hope It Helps. I Will Not Put This On Tripadvisor. Dusty Mirror  No Wine Glasses Or Fridge And It Would Have Been Nice To Have Drinks Making Facilities In The Room. Our Room Was In The Roof And Was Very Hot So Air Con Would Have Been A Big Plus. Only One Robe Was Provided And The Roman Blind In The Bathroom Was A Bit Difficult To Close. The Bed Was Massive And Really Comfortable. The Ensuite Was Clean And Modern With A Good Shower. The Toiletries Were A Nice Touch And Smelt Lovely. Most Of All The Interior Was Modern And Luxurious Which Appealed To Us. We Had A Pleasant Stay.,,,,,,
,516,Suit 1 Far Too Hot During This Hot Spell Needed Fan In Room,,,,,,
,519,We Were Not Really Expecting To Be Put In Room 52 Which Is Kitted Out For The Disabled.  It Was A Nice Room But It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Bath And The Toilet Was A Little High.,,,,,,
,520,25 The Room Was On A Slope So Not Pleasant For Sleeping And Generally Felt Disorientating. It Would Have Been Better If Tea And Coffee Facilities Were Available In The Room. The Room Was Also Extremely Hot Even When The Towel Heater Was Turned Off.,,,,,,
,523,Suite 3 - We Were Upgraded And Thought It Was A Beautiful Room,,,,,,
,526,We Would Have Really Valued Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.  As Someone Who Routinely Wakes Up At 5.30Am  I Would Clearly Not Ask A Member Of Staff To Provide Tea Or Coffee.,,,,,,
,529,Bathroom Very Hot,,,,,,
,531,Mallard Room- Lots Of Loud Strange Noises On Arrival Which Sounded As If In Th Hotel (As If Plumbing/Sawing) But It Stopped Before We Got Back From Dinner.,,,,,,
,532,Not Very Clear On How To Work The Dvd Player But Im Sure Someone With Knowledge Would Be Fine,,,,,,
,534,Suite 4   Room Extremely Hot At Night.,,,,,,
,537,The Bathroom Products Were Not Replaced Each Day,,,,,,
,545,Easier To Have Tea And Coffee Making In Room With Biscuits.....Gives More Flexibility.,,,,,,
,548,I Completely Appreciate That I Booked A Mid Week Break At A Very Reasonable Price So Thought The Room Would Be One Of Your Smaller Ones. It Was Very Small... But Very Nice,,,,,,
,549,Suite 2 - The Room Was Lovely And Warm  But The Bathroom Was Chilly All The Time Even Though The Towel Rail Was Hot.,,,,,,
,551,More Than One Bath/Shower Gel Would Be Helpful Although I Am Sure This Would've Been Provided If I Had Asked.,,,,,,
,553,We Were Upgraded To Suite 5 As We Did Not Want To Stay In The Annex. On Seeing Our Dissapointment We  Were Happily Offered  The Alternative Room Which Was Really Super. It Was A Lovely Treat But I Must Stress That All The Rooms Are Very Nice.,,,,,,
,554,Room 51 : The Creaking Staircase On The Bed Head Wall Caused Considerable Disturbance From Other Guests Using The Stairs (I At First Thought A Small Troupe Of Tap Dancing Elephants Were Practicing Next Door) Especially From 6Am On The Day Of Our Departure. If Sound Proofing Cannot Be Arranged Maybe A Note Could Be Left In The Rooms Above Requesting Consideration For Other Guests.,,,,,,
,557,Room 32 The Room Was Very Clean Nice Comfy Bed  We Just Found The Room Very Dark (Quite Depressing) We Do Understand That It's An Old Building Ect But Maybe Brighter Curtains And Decor Would Help ,,,,,,
,558,The Room Was Clean  However The Dressing Table/Mirror Area Was Quite Dusty  But Overall Really Impressed.,,,,,,
,559,The Room Was A Bit Tired  Shower Fittings Lose  Drafty Windows And Little Sound Proofing Between Floors And Rooms.,,,,,,
,561,Can Hear The Other Guests In Their Room Clearly.,,,,,,
,564,Room Was Quite Depressing And In Desperate Need Of Redecoration And Paintwork Really Dirty.  Not Nice Room At All  Looked Like An Old Granny's Guest Room.,,,,,,
,567,The First Room Which We Were Given(Swan) Was Dark And Miserable  Ie  A New Colour Scheme Would Help  Look At The Room From The Bed And Not The Door And You Will See What I Mean. The Second Room We Were Given After Complaining (24) Was Fine Even Though The Wall Paper Was Rather Overpowering! Need A New Designer Perhaps  However The Tiling In Bathrooms Was Second To None.,,,,,,
,571,A Little Dark.,,,,,,
,572,Room Was Extremely Hot  The Fan Provided Helped But There Seemed To Be Little Air Circulating. Top Floor Rooms Need Enhanced Cooling/ Additional Or Stronger Fans In Hot Weather.,,,,,,
,573,Aylesbury We Found The Room Very Hot During The Night But Noisy When We Opened The Window And Had Difficulty With The Blind In The Bathroom So Consequently Didn't Get A Good Night's Sleep.  We Appreciated The Bottles Of Water In The Bedroom But Would Have Liked Facilities To Make A Hot Drink And There Was Only 1 Bath Robe And I Couldn't Work Out At First How To Run A Hot Bath!,,,,,,
,575,Bedside Lamps Did Not Give Enough Light For Reading Purposes.  We Had The Room Outside In The Courtyard/Garden:  No. 52(?),,,,,,
,581,Sorry Cannot Remember But First Floor Turn Right. Very Unpleasant Smell In Hall Way A Sick Smell,,,,,,
,582,I Would Prefer A Kettle In The Room To Having To Order Tea To Be Brought Up.,,,,,,
,583,No Dressing Gown In The Room And Tea And Coffee Would Have Been Nice. No Indication If The Water Was Free Or Charged Same With The Sweets.,,,,,,
,585,Room 29 Mallard. Beautifully Decorated  The Bed Was Huge And Very Comfy  Pillows Were Lovely. Tea Making Facilities Would Have Been Very Welcome  We Felt Guilty That Someone Would Have Had To Struggle Up The Stairs!!,,,,,,
,588,52 - Dog-Friendly  Nicely Done.,,,,,,
,591,Bed And Pillows Were Particularly Hard. Difficult Nights Sleep.,,,,,,
,594,Would Prefer Tea Making Facility,,,,,,
,605,I Think Our Room Was Number 42 But Cannot Be 100% Certain. It Was Distinctly Average Overall  Aside From A Beautiful Chair There Was Nothing Very Nice About It And It Was So Loud All Through The Night And Morning. A Combination Of Street Noise And Neighbours.,,,,,,
,606,Room 51. Would Have Liked A Kettle In The Room.,,,,,,
,607,52 - No Air Conditioning - Very Hot. Disabled Suite Inappropriately Furnished Re Aids In The Bathroom. No Tea Or Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.,,,,,,
,613,Yes  This Is The Only Reason Why We Would Not Return.  The Situation Of The Hotel Is Such That A Great Deal Of On Street Noise Enters The Room  Whether It Be Late Drinkers Leaving The Local Pub  Deliveries Or Rubbish Removal Early In The Morning.  As A Consequence We Had To Sleep With The Windows Shut.  The Room Was Unbearably Hot And Airless And Both My Husband And I  Who Normally Sleep Extremely Well No Matter Where  Had Just About The Worst Nights Sleep In Recent Years.  We Did Mention This In The Morning On Checkout.,,,,,,
,619,I Would Have Preferred Tea/Coffee Making Facilities And An Ironing Board And Iron In The Room,,,,,,
,620,The Room Was Very Warm And Stuffy But Opening All The Windows Helped.,,,,,,
,623,Lack Of Internet In Room,,,,,,
,624,Breakfast Meeting Only So Please Disregard The Answers In Q8,,,,,,
,626,Did Not Get Much Chance To Enjoy The Room And Facilities As We Were Evacuated By The Fire Brigade,,,,,,
,628,Suite 1 - Surprised That There Were No Tea/Coffee Facilities. However  Never A Problem To Get Tea/Coffee From Staff In The Room Or In The Lounge.,,,,,,
,635,The Table Lamp Did Not Work And The Radio/Ipod Player Had A Fault On Its Aux Input But Apart From That Lovely Room.,,,,,,
,636,None,,,,,,
,639,Rather Dark  Needed Morelighting,,,,,,
,645,Our Upgrade Was Not Expected  All Together A Very Plesant Experience.,,,,,,
,648,The Toilet Was In A Very Poor Way And We Informed Reception  It Was Cleaned Straight Away. Room 26.,,,,,,
,651,I Think We Were 28. I Thought The Actual Room A Good Standard But Not Luxurious. The Sleigh Bed Was Great  But Felt The Quality Of Furniture And Tv Etc Let It Down. The Bathroom However Was Excellent With A Great Bath And So Nice (And Less Dangerous) To Have A Separate Shower.,,,,,,
,652,We Were Upgraded To Suite 5 And Was Amazed Loved The Bath!!!,,,,,,
,654,No,,,,,,
,656,33. Bedding Had Stain And Hair In Bed,,,,,,
,658,It Would Have Been More Comfortable If There Had Been More Pillows Available And Perhapd A Choice Of Duvets,,,,,,
,664,We Were Initally Disappointed With Our Allocated Room As I Had Telephoned Prior To Arrival To Ask If We Could Have An Upgraded Room As It Was My Partners Birthday.  When I Pointed This Our We Were Immedialy Allocated Your Best Suite Which Was Absolutely Wonderful,,,,,,
,668,See Above,,,,,,
,669,Toiletries Looked Good A Bit Basic  Delighted We Were Up Graded Thanks,,,,,,
,670,Suite 2   As Previously Stated  Although The Bed And The Room Was Comfortable And The Bathroom Excellent  We Found The Furnishings And Dã©Cor Rather Dark.  Also  Could Hear The Noise Of The Extractor Fan/Aircon Unit Outside The Fire Exit Door All Night (Fortunately I Had Earplugs!)  There Was Also A Very Cold Draught Coming Through The Gap Between The Two Bathroom Window Panes  Though Fortunately The Bathroom Radiator Was Very Hot.,,,,,,
,673,I Stayed In Room 51 (The Room Called Snipe  I Think 51 Was The Number) At First I Was Shocked By How Dark It Was And That It Was Like A Store Front. I Do Not Care For Dark Painted Rooms And Dark Fabrics. The Curtains Were Lovely Though  And The Bed  And In General The Room Was Cozy. The Bathtub Plug Does Not Work. The Windows Do Not Open And That Disappointed Me. However If I Opened My Door And The Door To The Building I Could Get Some Air. It Would Be Good To Let The Window Be Opened To Get A Little Fresh Air! The Street Was So Nice And Quiet And In The End I Really Liked The Location Of My Room And Found It Pretty Cozy. The Bed Was Comfortable And Luxurious. Thank You!,,,,,,
,674,Could Not Unlock Or Use The Safe. Two Lightbulbs Not Working,,,,,,
,679,We Were Given Room 33 Where We Found The Bed To Be So Small We Had 2 Nights With Little Or No Sleep Compounded By The Noise From The Street. The Staff Were Fine And Provided A Fan For The Room As We Had To Close The Window To Minimise The Outside Noise And Thereby Shut Off Any Ventilation. We Didn't Complain As The Booking Was Through Secet Escapes And We Assumed This Was The Standard They Had Arranged For Us. However  For The Third And Final Night Of Our Stay We Checked To See If The Adjacent Room (32) Was Available As We Had Seen Through The Open Door That The Room Appeared Better And Cetainly Had A Decent Sized Bed. The Staff Kindly Arranged For Us To Move To This Room For Our Final Night.,,,,,,
,682,It Was Rather Noisy Outside Our Window Early Seemed To Be Rubbish Collection And Deliveries,,,,,,
,683,The Hotel Is In An Old Building With Sloping Floors. This Cannot Be Changed Of Course. However  In Our One (43)  It Was Almost Impossible To Put Anything On The Two Small Side Tables  Without Fear It Might Fall Off. How About Some Rubber Mats On The Table To Avoid Slipping?,,,,,,
,686,The Bed Was Very Uncomfortable.  We Both Woke With Bad Backs!  The Dog Said Her's Was Very Comfortable.,,,,,,
,698,Lamp Shades Were Wonky No Biggy  But These Details Add To The Whole Look Of The Pkace And We Had To Contact Reception For The Tv Remote As There Wasn't One In The Room.  Also The Radiator In En-Suite Far Too Hot And I Burnt My Backside Twice.  Double Beds Very Disappointing As Majority Of Hotels Now Do Have King Size.  Didnt Sleep Well As Room Very Stuffy Probably Owing To The Hot Radiator Which We Were Unable To Turn Down In En-Suite,,,,,,
,702,Suite 5 - We Were Very Pleased With Our Room And Loved The Design/Decor. The Only Issue Was That The Window In The Bedroom Area Did Not Seem To Close All The Way So We Had A Bit Of A Problem With A Draught Coming In! Other Than That It Was All Excellent.,,,,,,
,703,There Was No Coffee Making Facilities In Our Room And We If We Ordered A Coffee  Â£4 Would Be Charged To Our Account  Which We Felt Was Excessive.  All The Bedding Could Have Been A Lot Better Quality! The Overall Feel Of The Bedroom Was Not Luxurious.,,,,,,
,705,Suite 3..... Delightful  Bathroom Products Could Be More Upmarket... Maybe Miller Harris.... Jo Malone .... Molton Brown Etc Etc,,,,,,
,706,Rooms Differ Greatly. Some Are Bold In Clour Others Rather Gothic/Traditional. I Like The Former But You Could Put Pictures Of All Rooms On The Web So People Can See What Each Has And Ahat To Expect/Select,,,,,,
,708,Room 43 Which Was An Upgrade.I Had Little Sleep Due To A Pump Or Other Device Stop/Starting All Night Long Under The Floor Or In Wall Of The Bedroom. The Bathroom Was Somewhat Oppressive With No Window And With Hindsight I Wish We Has Stayed On The Top Floor Of The Adjoining Building With No Upgrade Where The Room Was Far Nicer  Windows And No Pump Or Device Keeping Me Awake.,,,,,,
,709,Twin Beds Pushed Together For A Suite Is Not Acceptable. Basic And Cheaply Decorated For A Suite.,,,,,,
,710,Room 28. It Was A Nice Room With The Corner Aspect And The Stand Alone Bath Was A Nice Surprise. No Tea/Coffee Making Facilities Was A Disappointment  But We Were Offered Tea/Coffee In The Room.,,,,,,
,711,Suite No1- Disappointed With Lack Of Tea Coffe Making Facilities. I Dont Want To Have To Ring For Room Service In The Morning. A Window Catch/Stay Broken. On Being Shown Room The Uoung Man Flicked A Switch For An Overhead Light In The Sitting Area. No Light Came On Presumably Bulb Gone. Nothing Said - No New Bulb Fitted And I Bet The Light Still Doesnt Work! Sheet Lovely And Good Quality. Good Towels.,,,,,,
,714,Would Have Liked Tea/Coffee Making Facilities,,,,,,
,717,51 Would Have Liked Tea And Coffee Making Facilities.,,,,,,
,720,Please Put Tea Making In Room,,,,,,
,721,No.51 Very Noisy By Other Guests And Staff  Using Stairs. There Should Be A Notice Advising To Use Quietly Not Like A Herd Of Elephants!!,,,,,,
,723,The Bed Was Too Small - It Was Only A Double - As I Am Pregnant I Would Have Wanted A Queen As A Minimum. There Was No Clear Indication From The Website To What A 'Coltsworth' Room Had. I Would Have Paid More To Get A Bigger Bed. There Was Also No Shower Cap In The Bathroom - That Is Probably A Basic Amenity One Can Expect From A Hotel With Quality Like Feathers.,,,,,,
,724,Really Pleased Again With Our Room,,,,,,
,726,Noise Levels From People Walking Around In Room Above Were Quite High,,,,,,
,727,The Water Pump Was Very Loud When Using The Tap To Wash Hands And The Water Would Stop And Start  Not Sure If This Was A Water Saving Device Or Flaw.,,,,,,
,728,Bathrobes Would Have Been Good  Our Room Was Lovely But A Bit Drafty At Night  So If If In Need Of The Bathroom A Robe Would Have Been Ideal.,,,,,,
,729,Suite 1. Shower Cap Would Be Nice,,,,,,
,730,Tea And Coffee Making Facilities Would Have Been Appreciated,,,,,,
,731,Problem With Hot Water But Management Were Proactive In Assisting Us.,,,,,,
,732,Suite 1.  Room Was Very Hot And We Did Ask For A Fan Which Did Take Quite Some Time To Be Delivered. We Do Understand That Hot Weather Is Rather Unusual!!,,,,,,
,742,Room 32. Everything Was Fine.,,,,,,
,743,No Tea-Making Facilities Which I Can Assure You Even In A Boutique Hotel  Should Be Standard. The Staff  However Brought Me A Kettle And Milk Immediately Although My Daghter Had To Go To The Shop And Buy Tea! Suite 1 Was Very Hot-A Fan Would Have Been A Lovely Addition But Ther Wasn't One To Be Found. We Couldn't Find A Hairdrier.,,,,,,
,746,The Room (23) Was Quite Small But Otherwise Everything Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,752,Binmens Lorry Woke Us Vv Early  So Maybe Double Glazing Needed In Room 42?,,,,,,
,753,I Cannot Remember My Room Number  But I Having Seen The Pictures On The Website  And Having Friends Who've Stayed Before  I Was Disappointed With The Room Decor  Although The Bathroom Wasn't Too Bad.,,,,,,
,755,We Stayed In Room 26 On The Night Of 9 March. I Was Not Made Aware At The Time Of Booking That The Room Had Significant Problems. When We Arrived I Couldn't Really Understand Why There Was Such A Large Aircon Unit In The Room. However  After Dinner When Going To Bed I Realised. The Room Is Terrifically Hot And Gets Even Hotter And During The Night The Aircon Is Required To Bring It Down To A Bearable Temperature. However  The Unit Is Very Noisy And Disturbed Our Sleep. When Asked The Following Morning How Our Stay Had Been  We Mentioned That It Had Been A Problem Trying To Sleep With The Aircon On  But Other Than 'Sorry About That' There Was Very Little Sympathy Demonstrated And No Offer Of A Discount Which Was The Least We Expected. Had I Known In Advance I Would Most Definitely Requested To Be Moved To Another Room. You Must Be Aware Of The Problem And To Charge That Room Out At You Standard Rate For Db&B Is Not Good Practice. Trying To Sleep Either In That Heat Or In That Noise Spoilt What Was Otherwise An Enjoyable Stay.  ,,,,,,
,758,Suite 2 -- A More Effective Fan For The Hot Weather!!  But I Am Sure That You Had Difficulty Obtaining Such Items - There Don't Seem To Be Any In The Country!!,,,,,,
,759,The Bedroom Window  A Sash Window   Was Difficult To Open/Close.The Chair Had A Burn Mark  Showing The Padding Underneath. We Pointed It Out To The Staff Member On Arrival. The Mohair Throw Was Beginnig To Look 'Matted'.,,,,,,
,762,Weird One. Your Towels Were Holed A Bit Surprised By That,,,,,,
,763,54. Mirror In Wardrobe Appeared To Be Coming Loose And Access To Room Slightly Hard With How The Room Was Laid Out. Apart From These Minor Factors The Room Was Gorgeous And Every Thing Else Of Fantastic Standard. Loved The Cosy Feel To The Room.,,,,,,
,766,Not Sure Of Room No. The Room Was A Lovely Big Size But Did Lack A Bath Which On A Leisure Visit I Really Enjoy. I Did Call To Check If We Could Change Room But I Understood They Were Fully Booked. There Was Blood Stains On The Wall Handle For The Toilet. We Found Our Sleep To Be Disturbed From Noise On The Floor Above Us  The Bed Also Made Alot Of Noise Whenever Either Of Us Moved Whilst Asleep.,,,,,,
,767,Snipe Room 51: There Were A Few Cobwebs Around The Room,,,,,,
,771,Good Decor Let Down By Rather Cheap Bin And Loo Brush - Suggested Lack Of Attention To Detail.,,,,,,
,777,No Tea Making In The Room,,,,,,
,782,51 I Think  Ground Floor On Street. Quiet Comfortable But Did Not Like Window So Close To Pavement Where People Walked By,,,,,,
,786,Thank You For The Upgrade To A Suite  Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,,
,788,We Were In Suite 5  Which Was Lovely.  The Only Downside Was The Fact That The Walls In The Toilets Has Splash Marks And The Walls Could Have Done With A Wipe; The Lighting Unfortunately Showed The Splash Marks Up A Treat!  The Light Above The Bath Didn't Work But We Didn't Suffer And Reported It The Next Morning.    It Was Otherwise Really Good.,,,,,,
,790,Just As Previously Mentioned- Low Water Pressure Of The Shower And The Creaky Staircase On Other Side Of The Wall To Bedhead ,,,,,,
,791,It Was Very Plush And Comfortable. Huge Bed!,,,,,,
,795,Rm 29. Bed Was Very Lovely And Massive!!,,,,,,
,796,Can't Remember Number But It Was Small,,,,,,
,797,We Both Felt It Was A Small & With Tired Decor.,,,,,,
,798,Top Of Stairs To The Right. Oh Yes The Bloody Towel Warmer Burnt My Arm.,,,,,,
,799,Can't Remember Room - Up The Narrow Staircase Opposite A Suite.  The Iron Bed Looks Nice But Not The Most Comfortable I Have Slept In!,,,,,,
,800,Room Was A Little Small But As We Got A Special Rate That Was Fine And It Was Only For One Night,,,,,,
,801,Suite 1 - Only One Each Of The Toiletries  One Bath And The Shower Gel Was Gone!,,,,,,
,806,We Appreciate That Coffee And Tea Could Be Ordered By Room Service  But We Would Really Have Appreciated Tea And Coffee In Our Room So We Could Make It As And When We Felt Like Doing It  Especially First Thing In The Morning.,,,,,,
,810,Slightly On The Small Side,,,,,,
,814,Please See My Other Comments.,,,,,,
,815,I Have Already Mentioned  I Think Room 54 In The Town House,,,,,,
,817,Few Towels. No Dressing Gown. Hardly Any Wash Products. No Shower Hat. Generally Ver Yvery Poor,,,,,,
,826,Larger Beds Where There Is Enough Room,,,,,,
,829,More Product Needed.,,,,,,
,830,Room 51 - Please See My Earlier Notes On The Issues,,,,,,
,831,A Little Small But Very Comfortable ,,,,,,
,832,Room 54  The Fabric Of The Armchair Has A Very Obvious Rip On The Front.  ,,,,,,
,835,Comments As Before With Regards To Our Room,,,,,,
,836,The Room Was Lovely Although I Think There Could Have Been Some Tea And Coffee Provided And The Tv On The Wall Was Small (Owl) Compared To The Size Of The Room,,,,,,
,838,Happy,,,,,,
,840,No Mirror In Bathroom. ,,,,,,
,841,Suite 5 Just Needs A Bit More Lighting In The Desk Vanity Area As I Was Using It As My Bridal Suite And Struggled To See My Hair Being Done And Lastinute Sewing Etc. ,,,,,,
,842,First Impression Was Ok But Overall  It Was Skimped On Real Quality  I'm Afraid. !,,,,,,
,843,Suite 3 - Perfect!,,,,,,
,844,Room 24 - The Only Negative Was That The Bathroom Radiator Was Very Hot And As It Is A Small Bathroom I Was Worried That I Would Burn Myself When Getting Dressed.,,,,,,
,845,On Our Next Stay We Would Prefer Not To Be In Room 29 As The Climb To The Top Should Be For Younger Clientel.,,,,,,
,846,Would Prefer Tea/Coffee Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,847,Suite 1. Controls On Towel Rail Not Working  Therefore  Towel Rail Was On  Full  Throughout Our Stay.,,,,,,
,848,Suit 4. Pleasantly Decorated  And An Extremely Comfortable Bed.  ,,,,,,
,849,42,,,,,,
,850,No Tea/Coffee  No Hotel Information,,,,,,
,852,Number 54- On The Small Side But Cosy And Comfortable. Pillows Were My Only Issue A Bit Flat.,,,,,,
,854,Suite 2  We Were Grateful For The Upgrade  Though Only Used The Bedroom And Bathroom. The Night Table Lamps Were Faulty  The Knobs On The Antique Cupboard Did Not Match  And Were Not The Originals  So Could Have Matched. Otherwise A Very Pleasant Room,,,,,,
,858,Suite 4 - A Lovely Room. A Little More Art. A Few More Products In The Bathroom And A Better Tv/ Dvd Combo Would Make It Sublime ,,,,,,
,860,Would Of Been Nice To Have Tea And Coffee Making Facilities But Wasn't A Big Thing. Also Some Bubble Bath For Our Big Bath Would Have Just Set It Off  But That's Just Being Fussy. ,,,,,,
,861,Room 43 Woodcock.    The Sloping Floor Although Querky Was A Bit Strange.,,,,,,
,862,28 Goldcrest . The Chairs Were Basic And Out Of Alignment With T V. No Tea Making Facilities Or Frig. The Table Was Unstable ~ A Glass Slipped Off,,,,,,
,863,Our Room Was Tired,,,,,,
,869,We Were In Room 53.  The Bathroom Sink Did Not Drain Properly And Got Backed Up.  I Would Have Preferred An Upper Sheet On The Bed Simply Because Sometimes It Gets Warm And We Would Have Liked A Sheet As Well As The Duvet   ,,,,,,
,871,Plenty Of Space And The Separate Lounge Within The Suite Was Extremely Useful Over The Christmas Break.,,,,,,
,876,The Room (Room 14 I Seem To Remember) Was Great - Comfy Bed  Great Decor  Good Bathroom And Nice Shower (Although That Shower Pump Is Very Noisy!). The Room Was Fairly Clean And Tidy  But There Was Mould In The Window Frames Which Was A Little Off Putting - Obviously Overlooked For A Number Of Weeks!,,,,,,
,881,Fan Was An Issue  Stopped Me Fully Sleeping,,,,,,
,882,We Had To Ask For Toothpaste But This Was Quickly And Efficiently Dealt With For Us So Not A Problem.,,,,,,
,884,Unfortunately There Were No Bathrobes Which I Am Sure You Had Before? And It Took 2 Or 3 Calls To Reception To Answer My Query As To Whether They Were Supplied Or Not! Nobody Seemed To Know Until Housekeeping Arrived At 7.30Pm.,,,,,,
,885,Suite 4 - Could Have Done With Shower And Bath Products In Both The Shower And Bath As We Used Both. Apart From That It Was Lovely!! ,,,,,,
,889, 29. Would Have Liked Shower Gel And Shower Cap. Needed To Be Demonstrated How To Work Hot Water. ,,,,,,
,890,No,,,,,,
,891,Room Number 34 (I Think).  As Mentioned Previously The Wardrobe Would Have Been Fine For Some One Of At Least 6' - 6" But We Found It A Struggle To Hang Things.,,,,,,
,892,Room 53  Our Room Was Very Tastefully Decorated And Comfortable With All The Facilities We Required  We Found It Both Functional And Elegant.,,,,,,
,893,We Loved The Room And The Service Was Excellent  The Fresh Pots Of Tea Were Very Welcome. ,,,,,,
,894,Suite Number 3 We Were Over The Moon To Be Given A Suite. Again Please See Comments. Thank You Again Very Much For The Super Upgrade.,,,,,,
,895,Room 25 - The Room Was Lovely But Due To The Nature Of Old Buildings There Was Quite A Tilt In One Corner Of The Room Which Made Rolling Over In Bed Feel Like You Were Rolling Up Hill.  And You Had To Be Careful How You Placed A Glass For Example On The Bedside Table  As It Could Slide.  It Would Have Been Nice If There Had Been Two Comfortable Chairs In The Room  As Only Having One Meant That One Of Us Had To Lounge On The Bed Instead....... Not So Easy When Trying To Enjoy One Of Your Delicious Teas Or Coffees. But Overall We Enjoyed The Room And These Are Small Points Which If Put Right Would Have Resulted In A Strongly Agreed.  The Bathroom Was Lovely Too.,,,,,,
,896,32 We Noticed A Small Leak In The Bathroom Ceiling,,,,,,
,898,Suite 1. A Minor Issue Was That The Bed Sheet Had Some Dark Marks On It; Unsightly But Not Worth Worrying Anyone About At The Time.,,,,,,
,900,Nice Decor; Tea Delivered Promptly When Ordered. Comfortable Room And Bed. Bathroom Was A Little Odd  And A Few Strange Plumbing Noises.,,,,,,
,901,The Bed Wasn't Very Comfortable - A Bit Lumpy!,,,,,,
,902,Too Hot On Arrival.,,,,,,
,903,Would Like Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,905,Lovely Room (Suite 5) But Lacking In Info About Hotel And Area. Was Expecting Hotel Pack With Info On Telephone/Breakfast/General Woodstock Info/Tv Instructions Etc. Also Perhaps Nice To Put Gin Menu In Rooms Seeing As This Is Your Main Selling Point. There Is So Much To Read It Would The Perfect Thing To Leave In Room For Guests To Peruse.,,,,,,
,906,Mentioned Earlier Re Shower.,,,,,,
,908,Please See Earlier Comments,,,,,,
,912,43: Thought We Would Miss Not Having Hot Drink Making In Our Room But The Service Provided Was More Than Adequate,,,,,,
,915,No.,,,,,,
,925,See Item 8. Re Item 11 Below Only A Bar Snack After Sunday Lunch.,,,,,,
,926,As Previously Mentioned - Just Far Too Warm,,,,,,
,927,Suite 4: Some Noise From Staircase Next To Bed (Beyond Fire Exit Door).  Not Deliberate But Because Stairs Not Carpeted. ,,,,,,
,928,Quail ? 32 I Think.
Would Really Like A Separate Shower,,,,,,
,929,For The Price We Paid - No Issues,,,,,,
,930,Room 52  Nothing To Add As Expected... Prepared To A High Standard.,,,,,,
,932,Room 25.  The Curtain Had Obviously Been Pulled Too Strenuously And Had Come Off Its Rail A Little Which Made It A Little Difficult To Pull Accross.  However The Curtain Rails Simply Met And Didn't Cross-Over Which Let A Little Light To Come In. This Would Explain Why The Curtain Had Been Pulled Too Much.,,,,,,
,933,Suite 3
The Decor Of The Room Was Good And It Was Still Nice And Warm Despite Terrible Weather Outside. The Bathroom Was Great (Good Shower And Big Bath) But Limited Toiletries So I Was Glad I Had Brought My Own.,,,,,,
,935,It Was Chilly  The Towel Rail Didn't Work & The Hot Water Supply Wasn't Great,,,,,,
,936,The Sink Leaked. ,,,,,,
,937,Room 28. Total Luxury. Only Slight Niggle Perhaps Some Bubble Bath Or The Like Would Have Been Welcome,,,,,,
,938,Suite 1  We Were Upgraded And It Was Lovely.,,,,,,
,941,Plenty Of Storage Space But Room Very Small,,,,,,
,943,Room 25.  The Lovely Curtains Diin't Meet In The Middle Well As The Curtain Rail Didin't Overlap But Just Butted Together.  Consequently A Previous Person Who Had Stayed In The Room Had Pulled The Curtain So Strongly That It Had Come Off At The End.,,,,,,
,944,Room 55 - A Very Comfortable  Clean Room. The Last Flight Of Stairs Are Just A Bit Scary But We Did Expect That In An Old Building  So Not A Real Problem.,,,,,,
,945,Suite 3 - A Really Lovely Room  Extremely Spacious  With Comfy Bed And Enormous Bath Tub. We Loved It!,,,,,,
,947,Would Have Preferred A Room With 2 Armchairs Or A Sofa,,,,,,
,949,Room 32 - Can I Have It For All  My Stays Please,,,,,,
,951,Lack Of Wifi Access In The Townhouse Was Frustrating ,,,,,,
,952,The Sink In Our Room (No.42) Took Over 30 Minutes To Empty; The Bulb Had Gone On One Of The Bedside Lights.  We Mentioned These Points To Reception When We Checked Out.,,,,,,
,962,25 The Provision Of A Second Comfortable Chair Would Have Made A Lot Of Difference.,,,,,,
,963,Th Provision Of A Second Comfortable Chair Would Have Made A Lot Of Difference.No.25,,,,,,
,964,The Provision Of A Second Comfortable Chair Would Have Made All The Difference.No25,,,,,,
,965,29  Very Comfortable Bed With Loads Of Pillows  Really Liked The Room.,,,,,,
,966,Not A Major Issue  But The Desk Was Not Level On The Floor And Everything I Put On The Desk Slid Onto The Floor  Also The Cupboard Was Difficult To Open Due To The Nob On The Cupboard Was Broken. 
Both Issues Are Not A Major Problem .,,,,,,
,967,Please See My Summary At The Start Of The Questionnaire.,,,,,,
,968,Room 28. Only Comment Some Bubble Bath Would Have Been Welcome,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
