,----------------------,,,,,,,
,1,Service Seemed Rather Slow At Times.,,,,,,
,2,Had The 5 Course Tasting Menu - The Beef Course Was One Of The Nicest Courses Of Food We Have Eaten.,,,,,,
,5,We Had The 5 Course Gouret Tasting Menu As Part Of The Travelzoo Package Which Was Disapointing Due To The Size Of The Portions And The Order In Which The Corses Were Delivered  We Did Bring This To The Attention Of The Restaurant Manager And Two Complimenary Cheese Boards And A Glass Of Port Each Were Provided For The Four Of Us.,,,,,,
,6,We Had A Strange Dining Experience. We Ordered The Gin Fusion Menu And The Starter Arrived And Was Fantastic. We Then Waited More Than An Hour For Our Main  With Waiting Staff Giving Mixed Impressions Of Why That Was. One Staff Member Admitted The Main Chef Had Just Walked Out And That Waiting Staff Were Filling In  Which Was Rather Alarming. It Did Explain Our Mains  Which Were Mediocre At Best And Not As Listed On The Menu. When We Asked About This We Got Blank Expressions And No Real Apology. We Were Given An Extra Gin  Without Comment Or Explanation. We Did Ask For The Scallops Which Were Supposed To Accompany The Monkfish And We Did Then Receive These As A Side Between The Main And Dessert. The Desserts Were Fine But Not As Exciting As The Starter.  The Bill Was Not Included Within Our Final Checkout Bill But Wasn't Explained As We Did Query. We Assume It Was Because Of Our Disappointing Experience But It Would Have Been Appreciated If This Was Explained To Us  Rather Than Making Us Ask About Why It Wasn't There Which Wasn't The Most Comfortable Experience.   ,,,,,,
,7,We Felt Aspects Were Overpriced Eg Â£12 For 2 Scallops For A Starter,,,,,,
,10,Tasting Menu Was Okay But Portions Extremely Small.,,,,,,
,14,I Strongly Recommen To Have Music Playin In The Backgrond As The Silent In The Lobby And Restaurant Was Very Awkard: Silent = No Atmospehre - All Tables Dinners Could Hear All Tables Conversation Which End Up As Lack Of Intimassy In Each Table.,,,,,,
,18,The Value For Money Aspect Of The Dinner Was Debatable,,,,,,
,20,Dining Room Was Too Hot Although I Accept The Weather Has Been Unusually Hot.  The Breakfast Was Disappointing As Two Of My Choices Were Not Available.,,,,,,
,21,Really Superb!   I Have Dined In Several Michelin Starred Restaurants And This Was Equally As Good. I Am Surprised You Are Not Two Stars.,,,,,,
,22,Excellent Food  And Should Have A Michelin Star.,,,,,,
,25,We Had A Very Weird Choice Of Music Played To Us On The Night Of Our Dinner.  Unfortunately  Our Table Was Right Next To The Ipod Which Was Playing.  It Would Have Been Nicer And In My Opinion  More In Keeping With The High Standard Of Cuisine To Perhaps Have Chosen Classical.  It Was Strange At First  But We Got Used To It As The Evening Wore On.,,,,,,
,31,We Had Read Adverse Comments About The Tasting Menu And Size Of Portions But Need Not Have Worried As We Were Left Comfortably Full With Taste Buds Suitably Tickled. Breakfast Next Morning Was A Completely Different Matter. We Ordered Juices And Tea/Coffee Expecting It To Arrive Before The Food. It Only Came After 3 Requests And 15 Minutes After Ordering-And Then The Wrong Juice Was Brought. The Porridge Was Seriously Undrcooked Whereas The Full English Was Overcooked And Had Clearly Been Cooked Some Time Before It Was Seved. This Was Such A Pity As We Left On A Low Note Rather Than A High. The Choice Of Cereal And Foods Was Also Disappointing For A Hotel Of Such Class-There Was Little In The Way Of Fresh Fruit  No Croissants Or Bread (Other Than Toast)  No Cheeses Or Cold Cuts  And A Poor Selection Of Cereals Were On Offer.,,,,,,
,34,Small Portions In Tasting Menu. One More Bread Roll And An Extra Course Would Probably Do It!,,,,,,
,36,Our Waitress Was Rude And Impatient And Not Very Friendky,,,,,,
,41,Tasting Menu Was Extremely Sparse.,,,,,,
,42,I Do Think That The Mark-Up On Wine -- And Especially On A Small Glass Of Sherry -- Is Enormous.  For Breakfast I Only Have Tea And Toast  So Can't Really Comment. The Very Cute Little Jam-Pots  However  Were Sticky On The Outside. I Mentioned This To Reception  Who Said They Would Get Something Done.,,,,,,
,45,Really Lovely Food. Only One Veggie Option For Mrs Beaumont.,,,,,,
,50,Dinner Was Fine  Not Excellent.  Portions Very Small For Yorkshire Farmers.  Breakfast Was Not Good.  The Food Was Ok  But The Service Was Dreadful.  Table Too Small For 4 People  Know Where To Put Teapot  Side Plates Etc.  We Put The Teapot On Another Table To Give Us More Room And Then The Waiter Took It Away  Asked For It To Come Back.  The Tea Was Extremely Week In Both Pots.  We Had To Ask For Toast Twice. There Was No Jam Or Marmalade Left On The Buffet Table  I Asked If There Was Any More And The Waiter Just Pointed To The Buffet Table.  They Were Not Busy  But Seemed Very Unorganised And Stressed.,,,,,,
,51,We Were A Party Of Four And None Of Us Liked The Menu  We Swapped To The Al A Carte And Found This No Better  Had We Seen A Menu Before Booking A Table We Would Have Gone Elsewhere To Eat. Portion Sizes Extremely Small.   The Service At Breakfast Was Abysmal. After Being Seated We Were Not Offered Menus  The Table Was Far Too Small For 4 People  No Room For Tea Pot Etc. We Had To Ask Twice For Toast And When It Did Arrive Is Was Like Shrapnel. We Asked Where We Could Find Jam Etc Having Already Looked On The Breakfast Buffet Table (Where There Was None As The Recepticle For It Was Empty) To Be Told On The Buffet And The Waiter Just Kept Walking Before We Even Had Chance To Say That There Was None There. The Choice On The Buffet Breakfast Was Very Poor. The Cooked Breakfast Was Very Nice. It Was The Service That Was The Problem.,,,,,,
,53,No,,,,,,
,54,Had Breakfast At Bang On 7.30 Staff A Little Upset At Our Early Arrival But Warmed Up,,,,,,
,56,Breakfast Organisation Was A Little Hit And Miss. On Both Mornings A Table Had Not Been Set For Us. On The First Occasion When The Table Had Been Set  I Still Had To Ask For Certain Items That Had Been Forgotten. On The Second Morning We Had A Ten Minute Wait In Reception Whilst The Table Was Prepared But There Were No Fruit Yogurts Or Prunes Available. My First Choice Of Salmon And Eggs Was Not Available Due To Having 'Run Out' Of Salmon.,,,,,,
,63,The Food Was Truly Awful  The Main Course Just Assorted Scaps Of Lamb On A Plate With No Vetetables  The Lemon Meringue Square Was Very Synthetic To The Taste.,,,,,,
,64,Very Very Poor Service In Restaurant For Both Dinner And Breakfast Dinner - Cold Food  Only 3 Pieces Of Bread Offered To Us ('Sorry  We've Ran Out') Breakfast - 45Min Wait. Pancakes With Banana And Maple Syrup Turned Up With No Syrup - When Queries  Received Blank Look Then Told 'Sorry  We've Ran Out' I Brought My Girlfriend Here For A Special Anniversary - It Was Truly Embarrassing,,,,,,
,68,The Food Was Superb And The Service Was Excellent We Were Overwealmed By The Whole Experience. Thank You For Helping To Make My Partners Birthday A Very Special Occasion.,,,,,,
,69,The Main Course (Turbot) Came With Scallops Rather Than Langoustine As Per The Menu. When We Mentioned This To The Waiter He Had No Idea That It Was Different And Had To Ask The Kitchen Why This Was (Apparently They Had Run Out Of Langoustine - But Why Hadn't They Told Us That When We Ordered As One Of Us Had Ordered Scallops As A Starter So Might Have Made A Different Choice!).,,,,,,
,72,Ate The Gourmet Menu Was Going Well With A Few Service Mishaps That Were Dealt With Promptly Towards The End Service Tailed Off Dessert Was A Disappointment & No Chocolates Offered With Coffee No Further Drinks Offered,,,,,,
,73,Service In The Gin Bar And Restaurant Was Excellent - All Staff Very Knowledgeable. The Food Really Did Impress - Delicious And Cleverly Thought Of Ingredients. An Overall Lovely Experience.,,,,,,
,76,Breakfast Has Never Been Good.  The 'Buffet' Table Is Very Poorly Stocked And Looks Unappealing.  There Are Things List On The Buffet Table Menu That Aren't There Like Juices. It Takes Ages To Be Served And Even Then You Are Sometimes Given The Wrong Thing  Toast Comes (Cold) Way Before Your Food.  Service Is Nothing Short Of Erratic  Unmanaged And Staff Don't Always Seem To Speak English. Quality Of Food At Dinner Was Very Good  Service Good And Swift.,,,,,,
,79,Rabbits Leg Was Not Available,,,,,,
,80,And The Bar Staff Were Very Knowledgeable About Gin And Wine,,,,,,
,81,Very Poor. Sancerre Served Warm Tasting Menu Very Poor Fried Eggs At Breakfast Burnt.Service Slow Stilted And Distant. You Need A Good Maitre D.,,,,,,
,82,Food - Taster Menu Was Excellent  However Felt The Main Meat And Fish Course Should Have Been Bigger As It Did Not Add Up To A Full Meal. Service - Table Booked For 7.30 And Arrived At Gin Bar For Pre-Dinner Drink At 7Pm And Felt Rushed To Be Taken Through To Restaurant When Had Barely Started Our Drinks. Wine Taster Menu - Glasses Were Not Appropriate To The Different Wines And Were All Left On The Table Even Though Empty  Along With The Glass Already There That Was Unused. The Courses Were Not Substantial Enough To Warrant A Different Wine Per Course. Dining Experience Was Good But Not Exceptional Breakfast - Service Was Good But Food Was Average (Full English And Eggs Benedict),,,,,,
,83,Food - Taster Menu  Excellent Although Main Meat/Fish Course Should Have Bigger And Didn't Add Up To A Full Meal. Service - Table Booked For 7.30  Went To Gin Bar At 7Pm And Felt Rushed To Go To Dinner By 7.20 When Only Just Started Our Drinks. Also  Wine Glasses Served With Taster Wine Menu Weren't Appropriate To The Wine And Were All Left On The Table Along With The Unused Wine Glass Already There. Experience - Was Good Not Exceptional Breakfast - Good Service Althrough The Food Was Average (Full English & Eggs Benedict),,,,,,
,86,Service Was The Weak Point  As There Were Clearly Not Enough Waiters (As We Discussed With Danny) The Food Was Fabulous  But The Overall Experience Was Marred By The Lack Of Attention And The Long Waits.  We Had A Table Booked For 8Pm And Went To The Bar At 7:30 For Drinks.  By 8:20 We Had Still Not Been Called To Our Table And It Had Not Been Made Clear Whether We Had To Go In Ourselves Or Wait  With No Staff In Sight To Ask.  Breakfast Was Average - Obviously Not Cooked By The Chefs Who Had Prepared A Stupendous Dinner The Night Before!  Fruit Salad Ran Out Both Mornings And Was Not Replaced - And In Any Case Consisted Largely Of Apple.  Again  Lack Of Staff Was The Main Problem.,,,,,,
,88,The Meals We Had With You Were Excellent  Though We Found Some Of The Portions A Little On The Small Side But The Menu Itself Was Very Limited Resulting In Us Eating Out On The Third Night.,,,,,,
,89,We Had A Lovely Meal  The Presentation And Quality Was Excellent Although We Felt That Some Of The Portions Were A Little On The Small Side.  My Husband Ate Dinner Twice In The Restaurant And I Accompanied Him On The Second Evening  We Ate Out Elsewhere On The Third Evening As We Felt That The Menu Was A Little Limited And Perhaps Needed To Offer A Few More Options Or Perhaps Specials On Different Evenings?,,,,,,
,96,We Were Put In An Area That Was Like A Cafe Rather Than The Restaurant ( No Tablecloths Etc). The Gin O'clock Experience Was Disappointing,,,,,,
,104,We Enjoyed The Food  But It Was A Shame That The A La Carte Menu Didn't Change At All. Maybe A 2 Or 3 Night Rota?,,,,,,
,106,The Food & Service Was Excellent.  However  Once Again The Funfair Spoiled The Experience Somewhat.  Listening To Restaurant Music Being Drowned Out By The Noise & Screams Coming From The Ghost Train & Looking Out Of The Window Onto A Large Van Containing A Generator Spoiled The Overall Experience,,,,,,
,111,Quality Food. Lovely Breakfast,,,,,,
,112,I Had Cereal For Breakfast So Didn't Manage To Try Any Of The Items On The Menu (Which Did Sound Delicious),,,,,,
,117,Round Table Was A Little Too Big For 2.  Had To Speak Loudly To Be Heard!,,,,,,
,120,We Enjoyed The Experience Of The Taster Menu But Did Go To Bed Feeling Hungry,,,,,,
,122,At Breakfast On The First Day (Good Friday) We Were There About 30 Mins Before The End Of Breakfast And There Were No Staff Around And Most Of The Buffet Had Been Eaten And Not Replenished.   At Dinner On The Second Night We Arrived On Time At 8Pm To A Nearly Empty Restaurant And Were Sat At The Table Between The Only Other Two Tables Occupied At That Time - One Of Which Had A Small Baby And A Small Toddler  So Not Quiet The Romantic Dinner For 2 We Had In Mind.  We Asked To Move To Another Table But Was Told That That Was Not Possible As They Were Very Busy.  However As We Finished Our Meal There Were At Least 4 Or 5 Tables That Were Not Used At All Through Out Dinner Which We Could Have Been Moved To.  It Appears That The Staff While Competent Weren't Able To Think About About What They Were Doing To Respond To Customer Needs. Breakfast On The Second Day Was Slightly Better In Terms Of Staff  But They Had Run Out Of Yoghurt Pots (An Hour Before The End Of Breakfast) And Cleared All The Buffet Before People Had Finished Their Breakfasts.  We Had To Ask If There Were Any Pastries. Having Said All This The Standard Of The Food Was Very Good But For The Prices You Charge Your Service Needs To Be Much More Attentive And Reactive To Achieve The High Standard That Your Prices Indicate.  ,,,,,,
,124,Waiting Staff Pleasant But Service Too Slow And Not Asking If Could Help Further  Tasting Menu Too Pretentious In Portion Size And Too Fussy,,,,,,
,125,We Had The Taster Menu And It Would Really Have Helped If The Menu Could Remain On The Table So We Could Identify The Components Of Each Course. The Food Was Lovely But The Portions Were Tiny So Only Just About Full And My Husband Was Very Pleased To See A Full Breakfast The Next Morning.,,,,,,
,126,Slow Service&Gt;,,,,,,
,127,We Ate In The Restaurant On A Sunday Evening And It Was Relatively Quiet.  It Was A Little Formal Which Is Probably To Be Expected. We Felt That We Were Pushed Together At One End And Everyone There I Think Felt That It Would Have Been Nicer To Have More Privacy And Be Seated Further Apart.,,,,,,
,139,We Were On The Five Course Gourmet Dinner. Whilst My Wife's Lamb Hogget Course Was Fine  Mine Was Completely Inedible. But It Was Replaced Immediately And Without Fuss  However It Should Not Have Left The Kitchen In The First Place!,,,,,,
,143,The 6 Of Us Chose A Variety Of Dishes And All Were Very Good. We Had To Ask For The 2 Portions Of Chips Which Had Been Ordered But Had Been Forgotten. A Second Bottle Of The White Wine That Was Ordered Was Not Available  So Another Kind Had To Be Chosen.,,,,,,
,149,We Felt The Dining Room Lacked Atmosphere And At Times Was So Quiet You Could Hear People Ordering From The Other End Of The Room. The Food Was Excellent Though But Longer Intervals Between The Taster Menu Would Have Allowed Us To Appreciate The Wine More  The Next Course Was Out When We Still Had Half A Glass Left!,,,,,,
,150,The Waiting Staff Came Across Like They Were Trying Too Hard. There Was Absolutely No Atmosphere So We Asked If Some Music Could Be Put On But It Was So Low It Made No Difference At All. Everyone Was Whispering At Their Tables!,,,,,,
,152,I Would Say The Best Food We Have Tasted For A Long Time. Please Please Would You Aka The Chef To Email Me The Recipe For His Cauliflower Soup!!!! I Am Very Ill And Can Only Eat Liquids And The Cauliflower Soup He Made For Me To Have As A Stater Was Out Of This World! I Would Truly Appreciate It Plse. Julieconnoll@Btinternet.Com,,,,,,
,155,Evening Dining - Great Food  Great Wine  Great Service! Breakfast - Great Food  Slightly Let Down By Service. A Bit Clunky And Apologetic Compared To The Slick Evening Operation. Kind And Helpful Staff None The Less.,,,,,,
,161,Dinner: Whilst I Enjoyed My Dinner In The Gin Bar - Which Was Wonderful And Chef Very Kindly Made Me A Dish From The Lunch Menu - It Was Very Apparent That A New Member Of Staff Was Possibly On Her First Night At The Feathers  And Was Very Nervous. This Is Fine  However She May Have Needed A Little More Training And Knowledge On The Menu Before Serving Customers. My Overall Experience Was Good And I Am Sure She Is Now Fully Trained And Aware Of How To Handle All Situations. Breakfast: The Concierge Very Kindly Arranged For Me To Have A Very Early Breakfast For My Early Departure. I Had Ordered Fresh Fruit And Muesli  However I Was Presented With Rice Crispies. This Was A Minor Mistake  And Was Rectified However The Gentleman Who Brought It Up Wasn't Sure What Muesli Was When I Asked For It To Be Swapped. Again  I Was Very Greatful That This Was Arranged For Me  And I Am Sure That If I Had Have Had Breakfast In The Restaurant At The 'Normal' Time Then It Would Have Been Fab!,,,,,,
,162,Unfortunately This Was The Disappointment In Our Stay   This Was A Repeat Visit As The First Stay Was Exceptional .We Only Received 4 Courses Out Of 5 And Also Received The Wrong Main So After Missing Out The Assparagus Course We Carried On Otherwise It Would Of Been A Long Wait   Was Very Disappointing After Last Visit Also We Had Finished Our Wine We Wasn't Offered Any More .,,,,,,
,163,The Quality Of The Food Was Excellent But Whilst I Know It Is Called A Taster Menu I Did Imaging It Would Overall Add Up To The Size Of A Normal 3 Course Meal. This Sadly Was Not The Case And We Were Left Feeling Very Hungry Afterwards.  We Ordered Cheese And Biscuits To Try And Bulk Out The Meal But This Was Also A Small Portion And Did Not Help The Situation.  Overall I Would Like To Score The Food Higher As My Only Concern Was The Size  But It Would Be Hard To Recommend This Experience And I Would Be Concerned About The Size Of The A La Carte Courses Given The Size Of The Cheese Board.,,,,,,
,164,It Was Very Poor!!!,,,,,,
,166,Delicious Food And Excellent Service - A Real Treat,,,,,,
,168,Very Busy Evening And We Had A Table Booking For 8.30.  When We Arrived The Staff Were Very Busy And There Was A Lack Of Acknowledgement Of The Booking.  We Had To Wait For A Table And Due To The Business Of The Area We Were Left For 10 Minutes Before Finding If There Was A Table.  The Usual Overview Of Asking About What We Might Want To Drink Was Overlooked Until After We Ordered.  Not The Best But Partially Understandable Given The Nature Of The Evening.,,,,,,
,170,Too Long To Get A Latte Coffee At Breakfast  Partner And Others At The Table Had Received There Beverages Plus Cereals Before Latte Arrived.  Not Enough Butter For Four People At Breakfast.  Evening Meal: Had To Ask For Sugar  Long Wait Between Coursed On Taster Menu. (Although Waiter Did Appologise For One Course And Deducted Drinks From Our Bill  However After The Wait The Salmon Taster Came Out Cold.  Annoyingly This Should Have Been Hot.,,,,,,
,171,The Service Was Brilliant Both For The Main Dinner And The Breakfast,,,,,,
,174,Breakfast Service Was Very Slow Due To Low Staff / Guest Ratio,,,,,,
,177,You Are Giving Yourselves A Lot To Live Up To With Words Like 'Exceptional'. Dinner Was Good  But Not At An Exceptional Stndard.  Breakfast Was Average.  On Both Mornings The Smoked Salmon Was Not Available.  How Difficult Is It To Go To The Supermarket And Get A Pack Or 2 When You Know You Have Run Out?  Toast Was Hard......Almost Like It Had Been Cooked Twice.,,,,,,
,178,We Were Able To Substitute A Main Course From The Bar Menu,,,,,,
,179,We Were Very Well Looked After And Nothing Was To Much Trouble,,,,,,
,181,Hotel Tap Water Was Great!,,,,,,
,186,We Particularly Enjoyed The Breakfast Which Was Relaxing And We Felt Welcome To Take Our Time.,,,,,,
,187,The Picpoule D'pinet Wine I Felt Was Over-Priced And Not Of The Quality We Are Used To,,,,,,
,190,We Were There On The First Night Of The New Menu So The Staff Were Still Getting Used To The Menu Yet They Handled Any Mistakes Made Very Professionally.,,,,,,
,191,I Thought Dinner To Be Very Good  I Found The Dining Room Menu To Be A Bit Overly Fussy And Would Try The Courtyard The Next Time.,,,,,,
,192,Service At Dinner Was Very Quick  Not The Long And Leisurely Experience We Had Hoped For  The Portion Size Of The Tasting Menu Was Minisule  We Had To Ask For Extra Bread To Fill Us Up. Breakfast Service Was Very Slow  We Needed To Remind The Waiter Several Times For Toast  Coffee Etc. Only One Waiter At Breakfast When The Dining Room Was Full  The Poor Chap Was Delightful And Working Very Hard But There Is Only So Much He Was Able To Do!,,,,,,
,193,Breakfast Was A Bit Disappointing - The Buffet Selection Was Not Very Good And By The Time We Arrived At 9Am All Juice Bottles Were Empty (Although They Were Refilled On Request).  I Ordered Eggs Benedict And Was Told This Was Not Available - I Wished This Had Been Made Clear Upfront.  Dinner On The Other Hand Was Very Nice And The Service Was Excellent.  I Thought We Would Get Coffee And Petit Fours As Part Of The Set Menu But These Never Materialised - Which May Well Have Been My Misunderstanding.,,,,,,
,198,The Menu Wasn't Really To My Taste As I Don't Eat Fish And Some Of The Other Meals Didn't Appeal. For This Reason Our Meal The First Night Wasn't Great. However  Your Chefs Cooked Us A Chicken On The Second Night Which Was Beautifully Cooked And Presented And We Both Really Enjoyed It.,,,,,,
,199,The Vegetarian Selection Was Minimal And Overpriced. Service At Breakfast Was Appalling. The Yoghurts And Pastries Were Not Refilled And There Were None When We Arrived With Half An Hour To Go. There Were No Teacups On Our Table And It Took Ten Minutes To Get The Attention Of A Waiter To Ask For Them And Place Our Food Order. The Tables Around Us Were Not Cleared For Quarter Of An Hour. The Poached Eggs Had Runny Whites One Day And Hard Yolks The Next.,,,,,,
,200,Excellant Breakfast,,,,,,
,202,The Dinner Was Good  But A Little Mannered. Deconstructed Snickers Bar Was Inspired  But Deconstructing An Eton Mess - No  It's Intended To Be Messy: A Wild And Wonderful Mixing Of Textures And Flavours  Surely? You Can Acknowledge A Trend In A Menu Without Throwing Everything At It.,,,,,,
,207,The Tasting Menu Was Expensive And Extremely Small Portions,,,,,,
,208,The Service Did Not Seem As Crisp As Usual,,,,,,
,209,We Had The Tasting Menu.  It Was A Shame That The Waiter Did Not Explain What The Dishes Were When They Arrived. We Also Requested A Cheese Course Which Seemed To Cause Some Confusion,,,,,,
,212,We Felt That The Restaurant Was Perhaps Slightly Understaffed As Had To Wait Quite A While For Service When First Sitting At Our Tables And Often Had To Beckon A Waiter Over.,,,,,,
,213,Disappointing As I Had To Call A Waiter Over To Order Drinks And At The End Of The Meal Had To Request Coffee! Service Definitely Declined Towards End Of Our Meal.,,,,,,
,214,This Made The Stay At The Feathers,,,,,,
,215,Amazing Food And Wine,,,,,,
,216,Staff Were Very Accommodating In Finding Alternative Veggie Options In The Tasting Menu.,,,,,,
,233,Superb! Want To Come Again..,,,,,,
,234,Please See Previous Comments.,,,,,,
,235,Service During Our Evening In The Restaurant Was Slow And We Left Feeling That We Should Have Had Better Attention.  Our Breakfast On Our First Morning Was Slow But Very Good And As We Had Decided To Stay An Extra Night Our Breakfast The Following Morning Was Excellent.  Some Of The Staff Could Have Been A Bit Friendlier.,,,,,,
,236,Evening Meal - Dessert Was Tasteless.  Breakfast - Bacon And Sausage Were Over Cooked.  There Was No Marmalade Made Available Only Jams And Honey.,,,,,,
,237,The Feathers Would Benefit From A Toaster That Works On Both Sides Of The Bread.Staffing On Monday Had Difficulty Serving The Number Of Guests And Meeting Requests.,,,,,,
,239,We Had The Tasting Menu As Part Of A Travelzoo Deal And Whilst The Quality Of Food Was Very Good The Portion Size Was Far Too Small  Especially Given The Price Of Â£55Pp; We Went Out After Diinner To The Chip Shop Down The Road To Share A Large Portion Of Chips!!  The Eggs Benedict Was Extremely Good But The Full English Was Disappointing. The Poached Egg Was Cooked Very Well But The Sausage And Bacon Looked Like They Had Been Hanging Around For A While  Being Very Dry.,,,,,,
,241,Amazing Food!!!!!,,,,,,
,246,At Breakfast I Ordered Just Tomatoes And Mushrooms And Got One Of Each - It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had Slightly More (I Did Ask If I Could Have 2 Mushrooms)! There Were Also No Bowls Left When We Arrived For Breakfast But That's Not The End Of The World! Dinner Was Lovely!,,,,,,
,247,The Staff Were All Absolutely Lovely ... Only The Maã®Tre D' Was 'Efficient' To The Point Of Rushing Our Menu Choices As He Was So Busy!  The Food Was Delicious And All Beautifully Presented With The Exception Of The Bowl Of Ice Cream (As It Was A Busy Evening And Some Dessert Choices Had Run Out) The Ice Cream Flavours Were Not Advised And The Presentation Poor In Comparison To The Other Desserts.,,,,,,
,248,Unfortunately There Was A Delay With Our Breakfast Due To The Eggs Being Mis-Ordered. That Meant That The Rest Of The Dish Had Been Kept Warm And The Bacon Was Very Tough. I Am Sure However That This Would Not Normally Be The Case.,,,,,,
,253,Our First Evening Was Rather Unfortunate In The Time It Took To Be Given A Menu  Take The Food And Wine Order And Start To Eat. We Also Had To Ask For The Wine Having Already Been Given Our Starters. This Was After We Had The Tasters And The 'Soup'.  The Sunday Breakfast Left A Lot To Be Desired. I Was Unable To Cut Into The Bacon [ Was Given New] The Scrabbled Egg Was Left Uneaten.  The Second Evening We Asked To Eat Earlier [By Half An Hour] To Be Told On Arrival That We Were Early But They Could Accommodate Us. We Ordered The Beef That My Daughter Had The Evening Before But It Was No Way Cooked As It Had Been Previously. I Gave Mine To My Husband.  The Monday Breakfast For My Daughter Was A Joke. She Ordered The Pancakes Only To Be Told They Were Unavailable. She Ordered The French Toast With Maple Syrup And Told Again There Was No Syrup. We Thought That It Was Unusual To Have These On The Menu Yet The Kitchen Could Not Supply Either Of Them.,,,,,,
,257,Service Was Very Slow And Generally The Establishment Seemed Understaffed.,,,,,,
,259,Our Waiter Was Lovely (I Didnt Get His Name But He Was Very Charming With A Slight Speech Impediment) And Very Friendly,,,,,,
,260,There Seemed To Be A Problem On The 2Nd Morning.  Breakfast Was Not Of The Same Quality  Service Was Slow And Some Staff Appeared To Be Trainees Who Were Unsure Where Food Should Be Going.,,,,,,
,263,Excellent Wine List.,,,,,,
,265,We Had The Gourmet Menu Which Was Fantastic.  Also The Barman In The Courtyard For Pre Dinner Drinks Was Extremely Helpful And Knowledgable.,,,,,,
,266,While The Older Gentleman Who Served Us Was Very Good  The Younger Servers Were A Bit Unattentive And Also Managed To Mix Up At Least One Of Our Orders On Every Meal (Breakfast And Lunch),,,,,,
,267,The Food At Lunch Was Disappointing As The Tuna Lacked Flavour And Was A Very Small Portion For The Price. Also While The Older Server We Had Was Very Good  The Younger Staff Did Not Know The Food On The Menu And Often Got Our Order Wrong (Lunch And Breakfast).,,,,,,
,268,We Had A Lovely Lunch In The Bar. Beautifully Cooked And Presented. Our Evening Meal In The Dining Room Was Good Too But We Found The Free Chocolate Taster A Little Rich Just Before Our Orders Dessert. A Lovely Thought Though.,,,,,,
,270,We Dined In The Bar  Which Was Ok.  One Evening Our Experience Was Spoiled By A Group Of Five Very Noisy Rugby Player Types  Who Seemed To Have The Priority Attention To The Detriment Of Our Service - We Waited A Long Time To Be Served After The Starter.  Worse Was That The Group Obviously Thought They Were In A Public Bar And Their Loud Conversation Included Swearing (F-Word).  This Was Appalling And My Wife Went Over And Asked Them To Refrain As They Were Spoiling Our Evening To Which They Responded 'God Bless You'.  We Do Not Understand Why Such Types Should Be Allowed To Eat In (Presumably They Were Non Resident),,,,,,
,271,Service A Little Slow Sometimes  Our Starters Were Missed So Late To Arrive But Apology Made. We Ordered A Second Bottle Of Wine Which Was Late To Arrive - Apologies Were Made And No Charge For 2Nd Bottle Which Was Appreciated. Food Was Quite Good But Again Disappointing Compared To Similar Hotels,,,,,,
,276,We Dined In The Restaurant For Dinner And Breakfast. Breakfast Selection Was Excellent And Service Attentive And Friendly. However We Were Quite Disappointed With Dinner. Service Was Extremely Slow  Almost An Hour To Wait Before Starters Were Served. Another Long Wait Before Main Course Arrived And Then The Dessert Chosen Was Not Available. Not Previously Advised Of This. Portions Were Not Generous Considering The Prices Charged. The Lamb Main Course Was Very Well Cooked And Exceptionally Tasty. We Had Ordered Side Dishes With Our Main Courses Which Didn't Arrive Until A Good 5-10 Minutes After The Main Course Was Served And There Was No Mention Of The Delay Until We Queried This With The Waiting Staff. Overall Rather Disappointed Considering The Amount Paid For The Meal. Not A Great Dining Experience Unfortunately.,,,,,,
,278,Having Dined At Gordon Ramsey In London And Marco Pierre White Again In London We Both Said That Was The Nicest Meal We Have Ever Had. The Beef Was Exceptional. Thank You,,,,,,
,281,Breakfast  A Lot Of The Food Layed Out Had Gone By 9Am And Empty Plates Left  Ie No Fruit And No Water,,,,,,
,286,Please See Previous Comments Re Staff/Ambience And Re The Food - It Was Good But Not Exceptional Hence My Husband And I Didn't Have A Dessert. The Breakfast Was On The Small Side - One Small Mushroom?,,,,,,
,288,Dinner Menu Was Not Very Inspiring. Burger Was Good. Breakfast Was Ok.,,,,,,
,289,Service At Breakfast Was Very Slow And We Had To Wait To Place Our Orders And There Was A Long Wait Before The Toast Was Served.  No Top-Ups Of Tea/Coffee Were Offered And The Croissants Were Finished Before We Got To The Self-Service Table.  However The Staff Were Friendly And Obliging - Possibly You Were Short Staffed?,,,,,,
,290,The Quality Of The Restaurant Menu Was Extraordinary,,,,,,
,291,Breakfast Service A Little Slow; Inattentive.,,,,,,
,302,Really Lovely Food - Enjoyed It All,,,,,,
,304,We Booked Your Sleep And Dine Offer Which Included A 5 Course Gourmet Tasting Menu  We Were Very Disappointed With The Portion Size  We Have Been To A Few Tasting Nights Before And The Portions Where Very Small By Comparison...Very Disappointed After A Long Journey Down From Manchester.,,,,,,
,305,These Are Comments Not Meant As Criticism. We Had The Taster Menu. My Cod And Scallop Were Over Cooked. My Wife's Was Not. Our Lemon Meringues Could Have Been Put Together By Two Different People In Two Different Rooms. They Looked Substantially Different. I Was Always Taught That With This Standard Of Food  Each Plate Should Look The Same.,,,,,,
,310,Dinner Was Excellent. No Complaints About The Food At Breakfast But The Service Was Terrible. Several Tables Who Arrived After Us Were Served First And Wasn't Easy To Find Help!,,,,,,
,311,Waiters Were Very Attentative.,,,,,,
,314,The Food Was Sublime  Utterly Magnificent  And Probably The Best I've Ever Eaten. The Experience Was Slightly Let Down By A Couple Of Minor Issues With The Service  But Overall  It Was Very Enjoyable.,,,,,,
,316,Tremendous Attention To Detail And The Staff Were Charming And Skilled In Their Service.,,,,,,
,317,The Gin Experience Was Fun. Some Dishes We Wouldnt Normally Choose And The Gins Which Made It Even More Interesting.  Friendly And Informative Waiter. Unfortunately One Of The Other Diners Had Two Too Many Gins And Was Very Loud!,,,,,,
,318,Scrambled Egg Was The Best I Have Ever Had And I Told The Waiter So  -- Recipe Please  !!!!,,,,,,
,319,Many Recommendations To The Chef And Waiter Whom Were Able To Serve Us Lunch Instead Of Dinner On Friday The 14Th Of June 2013. It Was One Of The Highlights Of Our Wedding Day And A Wonderful Experience To Be Able To Spend Some Private Time For The Degustation Of Five Truly Beautiful Courses And An Exceptional Service By The Waiters.  Thank You So Much To All For Accommodating Our Requests.   On That Note  We Would Also Like To Say A Big Thank You To All Whom Prepared Our Desert Course For Our Arrival Late On Friday Night. Delightful!   The Breakfast Was Also Very Good. We Had Our Pancake Starters In The Bedroom Followed By The Second Course At The Restaurant Which Were Both Really Tasty. There Is Just One Minor Comment About The Room Service As Our Coffee And Tea Were Served With No Sugar Bowl Nor Milk Something Which Surprised Us For An Overall Exceptional Service.    Many Thanks Again. Mrs Harvey,,,,,,
,320,The Food Was Fine But In No Way Exceptional.  Was Pleased That The Dish Which Was Definitely Not Fine Was Credited To Our Account Without Any Need For Us To Ask.  Might Have Been Nice To Have Been Offered An Alternative Instead Of Having To Fill Up On Cheese.,,,,,,
,322,Dinner Was Exceptional.  Breakfast Was Good But There Was No Haddock And The Fresh Lemon Did Not Seem To Go With The Kippers.  Just A Small Thing As Would Definatley Recommend Your Lovely Hotel.,,,,,,
,326,Ordered Pre Dinner Drinks Half Hour Before Our Dinner Reservation. But These Did Not Arrive Until After We Were Seated For Dinner. When We Reminded Staff We Were Still Waiting We Were Only Told They Were On Their Way.,,,,,,
,328,We Were Delighted When We Asked If We Could Change Our Restaurant Reservation To Enable Us To Eat In Our Room (Suite 4) - After A Long And Tiring Day This Was Perfect For Us.,,,,,,
,329,Service Very Good And Friendly But Two Course Beetroot Salad And Beef Were Disappointing And Very Small. Have Eaten At Fine Dining Restaurants Before But Thought It Was Too Small Portions And Lacked Taste. Also Disappointed Booked This On Pretext Of Â£55 Five Course Meal On Arrival This Was Advertised As Â£45 But Because I Had Booked Through Tripadvisor This Was Not Refunded.,,,,,,
,331,Our Experience On The Second Morning Was Poor As We Waited For 25 Mins For Someone To Take Our Order For A Cooked Breakfast  Having Already Received Our Hot Drinks But Not Toast  But We Seemed To Be Ignored Although The Half A Dozen Other Tables That Arrived Downstairs After Us Were Served. As A Result We Walked Out Of The Restaurant And Told Reception Who Did Then Deduct Money From Our Bill.,,,,,,
,333,The Level Of Attentiveness Of The Staff And Their Attention To Detail Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,334,Dinner Was Good ( Exceptional Is A Very High Standard) But Not A Michellin Star Standard Which In My Experience One Can Usually Rate As Exceptional. Likewise Breakfast Was Very Good With A Good Selection But It Lacked Something Which I Am Afraid I Can't Put My Finger On To Make It Memorable.,,,,,,
,335,Evening Waiter Needed More Authority To 'Adapt' The Menu Options For Us As We Had A Guest With A Food Allergy.,,,,,,
,340,The Dining Room Could Do With A Slight Life As The Ambiance Needed Some Work.  The Food Itself Was Exceptional And The Attention To Detail Was Superb.  The Chef Took The Challenge Of Lactose Intolerance Seriously,,,,,,
,341,Dinner Was Very Good   Really Delicious.  The Restaurant Manager Was Polite But The Other Staff Were A Little Lack Lustre.  Breakfast I Think Was Good  But There Were No Baked Goods On The Buffet And The Wait Was Long.  Service Seemed A Little Disjointed.,,,,,,
,347,The Staff Were Superb: Very Attentive And Polite.,,,,,,
,348,The Rib Eye Was Tough And The Polenta Over Cooked Which Let Down An Otherwise Good Experience,,,,,,
,349,Sausages Were Burnt  Toast Under Done  Orange Juice Served After Main Breakfast.,,,,,,
,352,Disappointed That Only The Restaurant Was Open On A Saturday Night.  We Booked For 8.30  I Understand This Is The Latest Sitting As We Were Pushed For Time And Not Able To Put It Back To 8.45.  Did Thane Time To Finish Our Gins Before We Were Moved To Restaurant.  We Both Had Scallops To Start. We Each Received One And A Half Queen Scallops Each  Obviously Running Low  But That Was An Absolute Insult For The Price And To Cut One In Half For Us To Share  Appalling.  The Main Course Was Similar.  I Ordered The Lemon Sole.  I Am Sure On The Menu It Said Potato  Maybe Fondant Potato  Anyway  No Sign Of Potato  Infact Two Mouthfuls And That Was The Meal Eaten!  The Chees Though Was Very Nice And A Good Selection.,,,,,,
,353,Sadly The Courtyard Was Not Open On Saturday Nights We Had To Use The Restaurant.  We Were Hurried Through To Our Tble Booked At 8.30.  We Ordered Scallops To Start.  I Guess It Was A Popular Choice That Evening As One And A Half Scallops Was All We Got  Queen Scallops At That.  Totally Overpriced And Ridiculously Small Portion.  I Had Lemon Sole For Main.  Nothing To It.  It Was Supposed To Come With Potato According To The Menu But There Was No Potato On The Plate  In Fact There Was Very Little On The Plate.  When I Asked About The Potato  I Was Told That It Didn't Come With Potato.  We Left It At That And Decided We Would Stay With You Again But Will Never Eat In The Restaurant Again.,,,,,,
,357,We Booked A Table For The Thursday Evening (7.30Pm) But Unfortunately When We Went To Take Our Booking  There Was No Record Of It.  Fortunately You Accommodated Us With A Table At The Above Time  But It Made Us Feel Quite Embarrassed  And Unfortunately We Did Not Get Our Main Meal Until 9.00Pm.,,,,,,
,361,Portions Of Tasting Menu Very Small,,,,,,
,364,The Service Was Very Good In The Dinning Room But Rather Spotty I The Bar The Next Day At Lunch. Your Maitre Is Superb As Was The Receptionist. They Both Bent Over Backwards To Accommodate Our Every Wish,,,,,,
,366,The Meal Was Very Nice. The Cooked Breakfast Did Not Seem To Come With Toast  Which Seemed Strange? No Blood Sausage Included  But Mentioned On The Menu. The Coffee Was Too Weak.,,,,,,
,369,We Had The Five Course Tasting Menu.  Some Of The Courses Were Rather Small.  Also  Breakfast Service Was Slow Considering The Number Of Guests Being Served.,,,,,,
,372,The Gourmet Tasting Dinner Was Let Down By Wines Which Were  To Be Honest  Rather Indifferent - Particularly The Nz Sauvignon  Which Was Really Disappointing.  The Staff Appeared Unsure How To React When We Made Them Aware Of This.  A Shame  Because The Meal (Ie The Standard Of Cooking) Was Excellent.  So Far As Breakfast Was Concerned  We Were Very Well Looked After  But Did Have To Wait Quite A Long Time For Our Food To Arrive On The Sunday (One Couple Arrived After Us But Left Before Us  Having Had Their Two Courses Before Our Meal Arrived).,,,,,,
,376,Rather Noisy 'Corporate' Table Nearby At Dinner. At Breakfast Toast Arrival Was Very Late. Otherwise All Very Memeorable.,,,,,,
,377,Would Have Preferred Not To Have The Tasting Menu As Individual Courses Were Delicious And Not Enough On The Plate.,,,,,,
,380,The Food Was Ok  Not Excellent. We Had Tasting Menu And There Was Repeated Flavours. The Soup Had A Skin On It And Was Like Warm. Service Was Not Slick And Professional Nor Was Or Relaxed And Friendly. We Were Kept Waiting For A Long Time To Order Hot Breakfast After Being Told Ill Be With You In A Minute.,,,,,,
,382,Tasting Menu We Thought Was Slightly Disappointing   The Flavour A Were Not As Good As We Had Hoped But Still Enjoyed It.,,,,,,
,386,We Were Going To Have Dinner Bt Opted Instead To Just Have Appetizers. The Quality Of The Two Appetizers Was Very Good  But The Prices Were Too High And The Selection Too Limited For Us To Stay For An Entire Dinner. We Have Our 17 And 14 Year Old Teenagers With Us And It Was Way Too Fancy And Expensive. Breakfast Was Great However.,,,,,,
,388,My Chair  At The Far End Of The Dining Room Facing The Street  Put My Head In Direct Line With The Security Light On The Building Opposite Which Was A Little Blinding And Off-Putting. Perhas Some Blinds On The Top Of The Window Would Prevent This. Also  Some Quiet Background Music Wouldn't Be A Bad Thing - We Thought There Was A Lack Of Atmosphere When We First Arrived (Until Everyone Had Had A Few Glass Of The Exceptional Wine!),,,,,,
,389,As Previously Stated,,,,,,
,391,Stunning And The Food Was Fantastic!!,,,,,,
,392,My Partner Felt The Water And Wine Should Have Been Poured For Us At The Table.,,,,,,
,394,All Staff Very Good Daniel And Corina Delightful ( See Trip Advisor Comments),,,,,,
,396,The Service Was Poor  The Staff Did Not Listen Properly And Were Rushing Rather Than Being Attentive,,,,,,
,403,We Were Staying On A Dinner  Bed And Breakfast Rate. We Weren't Told On Booking That The Dinner Was The Tasting Menu. When I Questioned This On The Evening I Had A Very Poor Response. We Were Eventually Allowed To Have The A La Carte Menu. The Food Was Very Good In The End  Service Was Average. Breakfast Was Good But Service Was Very Poor. Unprofessional And Loud Waiter And Another Young Waiter Who Got My Husbands Order Wrong Twice. We Gave Up Correcting Him In The End.,,,,,,
,405,No,,,,,,
,406,The Portion Of The Beef Course Was Very Small For Â£50.  However  When We Pointed This Out We Were Given An Extra Steak And Not Made To Feel Bad About It  This Was Excellent Service. The Food Was Very Good As Well.,,,,,,
,414,Staff Were Not Very Attentive  All Seemed A Bit Bored. The Barman Was Excellent  And Was Much More The Quality We Expected Of The Staff. No One Was Rude  But Just Lacked Any Hint Of Enthusiasm. The Courses Were All Very Pleasant  But By No Means 'Excellent'. The Sweetbreads With The Pork Were Genuinely Revolving  Squidgy In The Middle  And I Feel  Ruined The Rest Of The Meal For Us.  The Restaurant Itself Is Very Pleasant,,,,,,
,415,The Star Of The Dinner Was The Gentleman Who Enthusiastically Explained Each Dish And Matching Wine. We Were Hugely Entertained By His Passion And Knowledge. Other Staff Appeared To Be Inexperienced Although They Were All Friendly. Breakfast Was Less Than Mediocre And Should Be Improved.,,,,,,
,417,The Restaurant Was Under Staff Both At Dinner And Breakfast But As We Weren't In A Rush It Was Not Particularly A Problem.     More So For The Staff Than Us I Think.    They Were Very Stretched Particularly At Breakfast.,,,,,,
,418,Breakfast Was Very Good Although I Was Surprised To Find  For An Establishment That Prides Itself On Its Food  That Hash Browns Were A Rather Basic 'Pre-Packaged Triangular' Offering.  That's What I'd Expect In A Premier Inn.  You Need To Cook Them From Scratch..,,,,,,
,420,The Food & Waiting Staff Were Both Excellent. Our Entire Party All Commented On How Good The Food Was. Both In The Evening And At Breakfast.,,,,,,
,424,The Taster Menu Was A Big Let Down. We Had To Go Out And Eat At Another Restaurant Straight After. In Hinsight The Meal Was A Waste Of Time. I Do Not Eat Much Genrally And Even For Me It Was Not Enough Food :(,,,,,,
,428,Service At Breakfast Was Dreadful.  Supper Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,429,Ive Mentioned This Before.  Food Was Very Good  Service Appalling Really.,,,,,,
,430,Dining Was Excellent  - Wide Range Of Options With Tasting Menu,,,,,,
,434,Some Of The Courses On The Gourmet Menu Were Minute And Not All That Tasty. The Lamb Was Cold & Fatty With Warm Gravy. Not What We Would Call Gourmet. We Have Eaten Much Better Food.,,,,,,
,435,I Realise There Was A Large Party Staying Overnight Who Completely Took Over The Bar Area Before Dinner  But In This Situation  It Should Have Been Suggested To Us That We Sit In Another Part Of The Hotel For Our Pre-Dinner Drinks.  We Would Have Liked To Partake Of The Gin Experience But Were Told This Had To Booked In Advance - This Was Not Stated In 'The Feathers' Newspaper And We Could Have Come Down To The Bar Earlier In The Evening If Known.  The Set Dinner Was Acceptable But We Felt Rather Rushed Between Courses Because It Appeared The Staff Wanted All The Diners (Apart From The Large Party) Eating Each Course At The Same Time.  Breakfast Was Acceptable But We Had To Request Toast - Shouldn't This Be A Standard Item?  Although We Were Served Reasonably Quickly  Others Around Us Had To Wait To Be Given Menu's  There Weren't Enough Tables Layed Up And It Seemed Quite Chaotic.  Although All The Staff Were Friendly  They Were Not All Professional And It Would Appear That More Staff Training Is Needed And Hence  We Did Not Pay A Service Charge And Will Not Be Coming Back To Visit You.  ,,,,,,
,438,We Had Room Service Twice And Each Time Something Was Forgotten Ie Cutlery  Butter   Kettchup,,,,,,
,441,The Staff Coped Very Well On Two Very Busy Evenings....,,,,,,
,442,None At All  Excellent!,,,,,,
,443,Mentioned Them Previously. If You Are Going To Sell The Hotel On The Gin Bar Experience  Please Have It Manned More Often And By Someone Who Knows The Products. Customers Were Left Waiting To Be Served. Just Seemed To Be A General Air Of 'I Dont Care' About The Staff Which You Cant Teach Unfortunately.,,,,,,
,444,The Dining Experience Was Good But Not Exceptional,,,,,,
,447,We Had A Lovely Stay. Our Waiter  A Young French Lad Was Very Good And Attentive. The Only Thing Lacking Was People And Atmosphere Really- The Restaurant Was Extremely Quiet. I'm Sure This Will Change With Continued Offers And Spreading Of Word Of Mouth.  The Bar Man Was Also Extremely Helpful With His Knowledge Of Drinks Menu.,,,,,,
,450,Over Eleven Pounds For A Gin And Tonic Was Really  Really Pushing It.,,,,,,
,451,Expected Coffee To Be Included In The Price Of Our Meal.,,,,,,
,452,It Was Very Hard To Get The Waiters Attention And It Was Funny To Begin With But Irritating By Our Second Meal. Service Was Fine At Breakfast.,,,,,,
,455,A Full English Breakfast Consited Of One Sauasage One Egg One Piece Of Bacon One Mushroom And Half A Tomato Not A Full English Breakfast,,,,,,
,457,Felt Dining Room Rather Old Fashioned,,,,,,
,458,Excellent Service However Some More Explantion Of The Dish Put In Front Of Us Would Be Better,,,,,,
,459,We Actually Found The Atmosphere Between The Staff At Dinner Very Strained And Heard The Head Waiter Telling Off One Of The Other Staff. There Was A Long Wait Before Our Wine And Food Order Was Taken. The Head Waiter Saw My Husband Go To Fill My Wine Glass After It Had Been Sat Empty For A While And He Actually Snatched The Bottle Off My Husband To Pour It For Me  We Weren't Very Impressed. It Wasn't Very Friendly At All In The Restaurant And It Wasn't A Very Enjoyable Experience. The Staff Should Smile More And At Least Try And Make People Feel Welcome. Breakfast Was Totally Different And The Girls In There Were Really Smiley And Efficient,,,,,,
,460,The Tasting Menu Was Too Flimsy - I Would Not Have It Again.,,,,,,
,461,We Actually Found The Atmosphere Between The Staff At Dinner Very Strained And Heard The Head Waiter Telling Off One Og=F The Other Staff. There Was A Long Wait Before Our Wine And Food Order Was Taken. The Head Waiter Saw My Husband Go To Fill My Wine Glass After It Had Been Sat Empty For A While And He Actually Snatched The Bottle Off My Husband To Pour It For Me  We Weren't Very Impressed. It Wasn't Very Friendly At All In The Restaurant And It Wasn't A Very Enjoyable Experience. Breakfast Was Totally Different And The Girls In There Were Really Smiley And Efficient.,,,,,,
,464,As My Previous Comment Plus: I Was Sent The Wrong Menu And Asked To Pre-Order. The Food Was Excellent Unfortunately The Service Was Too Slow. Many Of My Group Had Travelled Some Distance And This Was A Problem.,,,,,,
,465,On The Night We Stayed There Was A Large Party Booked From 8Pm.  This Had A Major Impact On The Level Of Service Regarding Our Meal  As Well As Others Who Were Dining At The Same Time As Ourselves.  One Of Our Main Courses Was Cold And Served Without The Side Dish.  The Side Dish Then Arrived.  The Dish Was Replaced After Some Time Without A Fresh Side Dish.  It Was Noted That Other People Dining At The Same Time Had Similar Problems  Even The Party Of 16!!!.  On Our Previous Stay The Dining Experience Had Been Very Good However.,,,,,,
,466,A Change Of Menu On The Second Night Would Have Been Welcome.,,,,,,
,467,Everything Was Great In The Restaurant However I Do Think Dead Daffs In The Bar Gives The Wrong Message  It Is Best To Have No Flowers And Just Candles Than Dead Ones.,,,,,,
,473,Service For Dinner Was Disgraceful. $ Americans Were At Next Table And I Was Uncomfortable With The Immage They Will Take Hoe Regarding Brittish Service.,,,,,,
,475,The Bar Was Slow With Pre-Dimmer Drinks  We Were In A Party Of 4 And Were Sat At A Large Circular Table Which Two Of Us Couldn't Seat Properly  We Requested To Be Moved  The Waiting Service Was Poor And Seemed Inept  One Of The Couses Was Forgotten And There Was A Seat Placed In Front Of A Fire Door Opening Into The Dining Room. Overall The Experience Was Not Of The Standard We Have Received Previously.,,,,,,
,477,Very Mixed Reaction To Food.  Lamb Asseite Was Full Of Fat And Largely Inedible.  Service Was Poor - Apart From Sven Who Really Was Very Welcoming - Nothing Was Too Much Trouble Unlike The Other Serving Staff.  Wrong Champagne Opened At Table - Finally Got A Replacement But By That Time We Were Half Way Through Our Starters.,,,,,,
,478,No,,,,,,
,481,Full English Breakfast Was Defiantly The Low Point  Overcooked And Dry  With Slow Service.,,,,,,
,485,A Lot Of Waiters Hanging Around Not Doing Much - Ie Not Re-Filling Wine Glasses And Had To Be Reminded Of That And Other Things.. This Was In The Evening. The Breakfast Staff Were Excellent,,,,,,
,486,Breakfast Very Disappointing. All The Guests Had Arrived At The Same Time And The Number Of Staff On Duty Were Struggling To Cope. It Took 25 Minutes For Us To Get Served With Tea And The Buffet Table Was Very Understocked So We Couldn't Serve Ourselves With Anything. Priorities On A Sunday Must Be To Get Tea/Coffee Served And Keep The Buffet Stocked Up. After That  We Wouldn't Have Minded Waiting For The Cooked Breakfast.,,,,,,
,488,The Food Was Good. The Waiter Was Pleasant -- But Service Really Was Very Slow And There Was A Mistake In Our Main Course Order Which Had To Be Rectified. This Caused Further Delays And Rather Spoiled The Overall Dinner  Though The Head Waiter Did His Best To Make Up For The Waiter's Error.,,,,,,
,489,Some Small Problem Locating Wine  And Chosen Wine Being Out Of Stock But Still On List  Service A Little Erratic At Dinner!,,,,,,
,493,Quantities Reflect Current Trend  Which Is Towards An Art Form Rather Than Quantity. The Meals Scored Extremely Highly On Presentation  But Beware Reducing Quantity Any Further,,,,,,
,496,Our Dining Experience Was A Disappointment So Say The Least.  First Course 'Ham Hock Terrine' Was Exactly As It Said On The Tin I.E. Over Salty Ham Hock That Had Been Placed In A Terrine Dish.  No Bread Had Been Offered To Us - Had To Ask. After A Very Long Wait Our Second Course Arrived.  My Husband Enjoy His Chicken Infuse With Gin.  Memories Of My Assiette Of Pork Make Me Feel Queasy Even Now.  Some Pieces Were Undercooked And Cold And Other Just Very Unpleasant.  We Spoke With Our Server Who Tried His Best In The Situation And Offered Another Dish  Which I Refused.  Had No Desserts.  The Offending 'Pork' Was Deducted From The Bill.  Cancelled Our Table For Sunday Lunch. ,,,,,,
,498,The Dining Room Was A Little Chilly,,,,,,
,501,We Were Disappointed With The 5-Course Dining Experience As We Felt The Portions Were Extremely Small And The Gentlemen In Our Party Wanted To Go To The Pub Afterwards For Something Substanital To Eat! The Breakfast Was Also A Little Disappointing In That The Poaches Eggs On The Eggs Benedict Were Hardboiled Which Spoilt It A Little.,,,,,,
,505,I Felt That The Food Was Very Expensive And Very Small  And We ( My Sister And I) Are Not Big Eaters. The Food We Ate Was Delicious But For That Price Should Have Perhaps Included Some Vegetables .,,,,,,
,506,See My Previous Comments Re Our Dining Experience.,,,,,,
,511,Dinner Was Fantastic But Breakfast Was Poor .,,,,,,
,518,The Food Is Probably Very Good  But There Wasn't A Great Deal That Appealed To Me  I Had Pork And It Was A Little Dry  Our Starters Were Very Good.,,,,,,
,519,The Breakfast Service Was Better On The Friday Morning Than The Saturday.,,,,,,
,520,The Service Was Pleasant But Extremely Slow. At Breakfast We Had To Wait A Long Time Before Our Tea And Food Arrived. It Would Be A Good Idea To Serve The Drinks And Toast First  Prior To The Hot Breakfast. I Think They Were Short Staffed In The Morning. There Were No Pastries Although They Were On The Menu. The English Breakfast Would Have Benefited From Some Beans. We Had The Tasting Menu In The Evening. It Was Ok But We Were Left A Little Hungry.,,,,,,
,522,Gin Menu Fantastic,,,,,,
,523,The Portions Of Some Of The Dishes Were Quite Small E.G. There Was Only One Ravioli In The Starter.  It Was Tasty Though But There Could At Least Have Been Three Of Them.,,,,,,
,524,Very Impressed With Team For Accomodating For My Other Half Who Had A Fish Allergy At Such Short Notice.,,,,,,
,526,Waiting Staff Were Helpful And Friendly.  We Were A Little Baffled  As We Ordered Eggs Benedict For Breakfast But This Came With Spinach Which We Would Normally Be Called Eggs Florentine.  We Queried This But Were Told (Very Nicely) That This Was Eggs Benedict.  This Is Hardly A Life Threatening Experience But Just Slightly Odd.,,,,,,
,529,Breakfast Buffet Table On Sunday Morning 10.00Am Very Disappointing. No Pastries  No Individual Fruit Layer Yoghurts As Per Previous Visits  Run Out Of Fruit Salad  Buffet Table Covered In Crumbs And Used Weetabix Wrappers. Communal Yoghurt From Pot Very Thin And Low Quality. Whole Experience Smelled Of An Economy Drive By Hotel. Spoiled An Otherwise Excellent Stay. Wrong Lasting Impression To Give Guests Just Before They Depart.,,,,,,
,531,Amazing Puddings. The Eggs Benedict For Breakfast Was Phenomenal.,,,,,,
,545,Tuna Was Unavailable Once Ordered...Hash Browns Were Unavailable At Breakfast...Portions Very Small....Main Course Of Lamb Dull And Boring,,,,,,
,548,The Food Was Very Good And The Barman Very Knowledgeable About The Vaste Number Of Gin's! The Room Lacked A Little Atmospehere  Although Again  I Appreciate This Was Mid Week And Obviously Not Your Busiest Time. It's Such A Shame That You Are Unable To See The Bar From The Seating Area.,,,,,,
,549,The Fresh Fruit On Offer Needs To Be Greater And The Fruit Salad Topped Up Regularly.,,,,,,
,551,Fantastic Experience Couldn't Have Been Improved Upon,,,,,,
,553,The Whole Experience Is Very Good From Explaining All The Different Gins To Telling Us A Lovely Table By The Window Is Ready When We Were. We Have Previously Dined In The Restaurant And Both Menus Are Very Good  So Is The Food Of Course.,,,,,,
,554,We Found That The Sweets We Sampled Did Not Reach The High Standard Of The Rest Of The Meal.,,,,,,
,557,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Evening Meal The Food Was Lovely The Staff Very Nice Would Love To Eat There Again ,,,,,,
,558,Food Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,561,Took Two Hours To Serve Up The 3 Course Dinner. Service Was Slow On The Night We Stayed Due To A `Melt Down In The Kitchen. Staff Seemed Rushed. Bread Rolls Were Too Small. Forgot Our Side Dish.,,,,,,
,565,We Had The Gourmet Tasting Menu - We Feel That The Waiters Rushed Us Through The Courses - We Wanted To Make An Evening Of It.  Also Your Wine Waiter Filled Up Our Glasses To High - A Good Sommelier Would Refill The Glasses Gradually.  Pity Really As The Food Is Good And Well Presented.,,,,,,
,567,You Are Fortunate In Having The Services Of An Excellent Chef .,,,,,,
,571,The Dining Room Felt A Little Cold And Canteen Like.,,,,,,
,572,Particularly Liked Dining In The Courtyard In Summer.,,,,,,
,573,We Had The Taster Menu But Fennel Appeared To Feature More Than Once.  The First Half Of The Meal Was Served Almost Too Quickly And Then We Seemed To Wait A Long Time For The Final Courses During Which Time We Had Finished Our Wine And Water But Weren't Offered Anything Else.,,,,,,
,575,Eating Off A Slate (Roof Tile?) Is Not A Pleasant Experience And Doesn't Enhance The Look Or Taste Of The Food.  Cutlery Coming Into Contact With Slate ..... Very Unpleasant.  They Are Also Very Difficult For The Waiters To Pick Up When Clearing The Table.  Rather Too Many Smears And Blobs Decorating The Main Courses.  I Queried What I Thought Was A Missing Ingredient In One Course  Only To Be Told That It Was Present In The Form Of Two Penny-Sized Blobs Of Sauce.,,,,,,
,576,Waiting Staff A Bit Over-Attentive And Confused By Us Wanting To Try Different Gins.,,,,,,
,578,The Evening Meal Was Excellent  Breakfast Not So Good. The Service For Breakfast Was Slow And The Staff Seemed Harassed. The Toast Was Burnt On One Side And Uncooked On The Other. When I Pointed This Out To The Waitress She Was Quite Aggressive And Said The Toaster Had Broken And She Could Not Go Out And Buy A New Toaster As She Would Like To Because She Was Fed Up With The Situation. She Felt The Management Had Not Dealt With It Quickly Enough. I Appreciated Her Frustration But Was Unhappy With Her Tone To Me.,,,,,,
,582,At Dinner The Waiter Spilt A Bottle Of Tonic Water All Over The Table  Narrowly Missing Soaking And Ruining My Partner's Phone.  At Breakfast We Had To Ask Several Times For Cutlery  Tea Etc  Although It Was Not Busy.,,,,,,
,584,Items Not Available In The Menu Alternatives Offered But Different Things Served,,,,,,
,588,The Restaurant Staff Were All Well-Trained  Courteous And Helfpul. I Would Single Out The Barman/Sommelier/Waiter On The 25Th Who Served Us In The Gin Bar And Was Very Knowledgeable  Then Was Also Helpful With Food And Wine.,,,,,,
,589,The Food Was To A Very High 'Fine Dining' Standard. The Only Adverse Comment Was To Do With Our Drinks Canapã©S. These Were Delicious But We Found It Almost Impossible To Eat The Cream Cheese Quenelles. I Was Told We Should Use The Potato Wedge  However In My Case This Was Too Fragile And We Ended Up Trying To Enjoy The Cheese With A Cocktail Stick !! I Should Say This Is Merely A Comment And Not A Complaint. Over All The Food Superb The Best I've Had For A Long Time.,,,,,,
,591,I Considered The Wine To Be Very Expensive.  The Food Portions Of Food Were Woefully Inadequate. I And My Wife Had To Find Secondary Food Outlet As We Both Felt Hungry After The Meal. Not The Experience We Anticipated. Some Staff English Language Was Questionable.,,,,,,
,592,Worthy Of An Inclusion In The Gfg.,,,,,,
,595,The Breakfasts Were Alledgedly ''Cooked To Order''  Not The Case On Monday 6 May  Very Poor Quality  Extremely Dry As If It Had Been Heated Up.,,,,,,
,599,We Had The Gourment Experience For Dinner But Felt That We Would Go For The Al La Carte Meal Next Time As Felt That Not All Of The Food Was To Our Liking And Too Many Courses.,,,,,,
,605,The Dinner Was Nice But I Wouldn't Quite Call It 'Exceptional',,,,,,
,606,Ordering Of Dinner Was Rather Slow And Haphazard. I Had To Request The Wine List Twice. Staff Originally Tried To Seat Us In The Empty Courtyard Gin Bar For Dinner And Initially Told Us The Dining Room Was Full. After Complaining To The Manager We Were Moved Into The Dining Room. Breakfast Was A Rather Disappointing Affair As The Food Was Not Freshly Cooked As We Would Expect. Crockery Was More Fitting For A Cafã© And Not What We Are Used To At The Feathers.,,,,,,
,612,The Vegetarian Main Course Said Baked Celeriac - It Came As Baked Onion!,,,,,,
,621,Overall Good But My Husband Had Scallops To Start..But 1 Scallop And There Was Part Of Another Scallop On Plate...This As First Course Was Disappointing..Although Overall Food Good But Not As Good As Last Tie. Coffee And Chocs Excellent..But Did Cost 9.50.,,,,,,
,628,Would Have Liked A Little More Description Of Tasting Menu As Each Course Arrived.,,,,,,
,635,Excellent As Usual Thank You.,,,,,,
,636,We Have Been Coming To Your Hotel For Nearly 20 Years And This Time The Food Served Was Average/Gastro Pub At Best-Huge Disappointment Unlikely We Will Come Again Or Recommend To Our Friends Anymore-A Real Shame.,,,,,,
,637,With The Dessert I Found That The Crackling Candy On It Was Overwhelming & I Was Unable To Eat It Which Was Disappointing. When The Waiter Asked Why I Hadn't Eaten It & I Explained He Didn't Really Seem To Understand My Problem With It. He Just Removed The Plate With No Offer Of A Replacement Maybe Without The Crackling Candy Or Something Different. I Found That A Little Unusual As In Most Other Restaurants I Have Eaten If There Is A Problem The Staff Are Usually Quite Eager To Resolve Them. However The Rest Of My Meal & My Husbands Meal Also Were Very Enjoyable.,,,,,,
,639,As A First Class Hotel And At Your Prices I Think You Should Serve 'Real' Orange Juice At Breakfast -,,,,,,
,641,My Wife And I Thoroughly Enjoyed Dinner.  The Food At All Times Was Excellent And The Wine List Well Selected Including Some More Mature Wines In The Lower Price Brackets - A Rarity.  My Only Negative Observation Was That Service At Breakfast Was Slow - I Suspect All Guests Came Down At About The Same Time Which Was Too Much For The Two Staff.,,,,,,
,645,Enjoyed Evening Meal And Breakgast  Staff Particularly Friendly,,,,,,
,651,Thought Food And Service Were Excellent  My Only Comment (I Had 5 Course Gourmet) Is The Courses Did Come Out Too Quick  Would Have Been Nice To Have A Longer Delay. However I Must Also Comment That My Wife Just Wanted A Steak ( And The Package Included The 5 Course) This Was Accommodated With No Fuss And Was Much Appreciated.,,,,,,
,652,Seem Really Short Staff And There Was An Argument In The Kithcen And No Gin Tasting Menu Avaliable,,,,,,
,654,No,,,,,,
,655,The Taster Menu Was Rather Adventurous In Taste Values And In Future I Would Select From The A La Carte Menu (Which Is Probably A Safer  More Cautious Option),,,,,,
,659,There Was A Dog Wandering Round In The Courtyard Gin Bar.  We Understand That Dogs Are Not Allowed In The Restaurant  And Consider That The  Same Rule Should Apply In The Courtyard. We Sat By A Window And It Was A Bit Cold.,,,,,,
,660,I Appreciated The Different Wines Accompanying The Gourmet Menu - Thank You,,,,,,
,664,Ate In The Restaurant Both Nights.  Chose A La Carte First Night And The Chef Made An Alternative Tasting Menu The Second Evening So We Could Try Different Dishes.  It Was Absolutely Fabulous.  Head Chef Was Off That Night And His Number Two Certainly Didnt Let Him Down,,,,,,
,668,Good Was Very Good But Not Excellent. We Had The Taster Menu And I Was Told That We Could Choose Our Courses When Booking Which Wasn't The Case. One Waiter Was Friendly  The Other Was Quite Cold.,,,,,,
,669,You Asked Our Dietary Preferences In Advance And Then For The Main Lamb Course At Dinner Included Bacon In The Cabbage Which We Had Specifically Indicated We Did Not Eat . The Lamb Was Not As Described On The Menu No Cornish Pasty   No Cauliflower Cheese It Was Returned Reheated And Dry With Cabbage Not A Very Appealing Main Course  Starters Excellent Sweets Quite Good   The Polish Waiter Was Excellent As Was The Barman In The Gin Bar But The Head Waiter Seemed To Vanish After He Had Taken Our Order And Never Reappeared To Apologise For The Main Course Mistake. He  Left It To His Charming Junior  Breakfast Service Erratic And Inattentive Smoked Salmon Leathery But Otherwise Good Liked The Fresh Orange Juice,,,,,,
,670,Superb Food And Very Helpful And Friendly Staff Both At Dinner And At Breakfast.,,,,,,
,673,I Am Vegetarian And Found A Few Nice Things On The Menu For Dinner  But The One Night The Chef Created A Special Dish For Me  A Vegetable Tart (With Fennel And Leek) That Was Delicious! Also The Beetroot Salad Appetizer Was Lovely. All The Looseleaf Teas Are Wonderful. I Very Much Appreciate Those Too. In General I Would Have Liked There To Be More Vegetarian Choices But The Chef Was Very Accommodating. The Breakfasts Were Wonderful! Thank You.,,,,,,
,677,Lack Of Organisation In Restaurant. Glasses Moved By One Person Then Returned Etc . Hard To Know Who Was In Charge Though Individuals Polite. Very Small Portion Of Turbot. Breakfast Order Undercooked  Then Overcooked. Just Simple Soft Boiled Eggs. Told A Refresh Of Tea And Coffee At Breakfast Would Be 'Extra' . Astonishing At That Price/Standard Of Hotel.,,,,,,
,679,It Would Be Nice To Have Some Different Choices Of Menu Each Evening. For The Breakfast  Each Morning We Were Told No Hash Browns Were Available. I Can Understand That For The One Morning But Surely The Chef Could Prepare Some For The Following Morning They Are Not Difficult To Prepare.,,,,,,
,681,We Were So Looking Forward To Our Evening Meal Experience  We Chose The Share Option Beef At Â£50  Thinking It Was Going To Be So Nice  Sadly Our Beef Was Tough And Chewy But The Reast Was All Ok. So I Guess You Now Know We're Very Disappointed  And Would Not Recommend That Dish To Others. We Would Consider Recommending The Feathers To Friends But Not The Beef  Otherwise A Lovey Stay  Just A Shame About The Meal. Hopefully You May Invite Us Back To Rectify That. Regards,,,,,,
,683,We Ate A Superb Dinner. We Also Ate A Small Lunch And I Was Disappointed Not To Be Given The Bread With My Soup I Was Expecting  But Others Had Some So We Shared. The Waiter's English Was Not The Best And He Did Not Seem To Understand Our Comment About The Bread. Nothing Spoilt The Food Though It Was Great.,,,,,,
,684,Could Not Offer Butter Substitute Apart From Oil-Not Very Good With Toast & Preserves,,,,,,
,688,Questions Are A Bit Loaded. We Had A Really Good Dinner But It Was Not Exceptional. What Was Really Lovely Was To Be Able To Eat In The Garden. That Made The Evening Special.,,,,,,
,689,We Selected To Have The Wine Matching  And Quite Often The Empty Glasses From The Previous Glasses Were Left On Our Table  Even After The Next Wine Was Served. Why They Could Not Take Them Away  I'm Not Sure. Also  Just From A Business Point Of View  At No Point Did Any Staff Try To Upsell Or Attach Further Sale. With This  I Mean That I Am Used To Waiting Staff Suggesting Extras. So  No One Suggested That We Have The Pairing Wines  It Was My Initiative. Also  It Would Have Been Nice Is Someone Asked Us What Our Favorite Wine Was From The 5 We Had  And Asked If We Would Like A Bottle. Or Maybe Would We Like To Upgrade From The Gourmet Menu To The Tasting Menu. Even When We Were Outside Having A Drink In The Afternoon  When The Waiter/Barman Came To Collect Our Empty Glasses  He Never Asked If We Would Like Another Drink. These Are All Areas Where You Could Generate Further Revenue  And Also Make You Customers Feel Like That Are Getting Attentive Service.,,,,,,
,690,At Dinner The Service Was Average. The Food Was Excellent. The Music Playing In The Background Was Appalling.  We Had A Package With A Free Breakfast Included However We Were Not Informed As To Whether Coffee Or Juice Would Be Included Even After Asking The Waiter. The Service Was Average Again  Friendly But Seemed To Be A Bit Unsure.,,,,,,
,692,The Food Was Well Presented And Acceptable  While Not Outstanding.,,,,,,
,694,Just A Few Chef Comments' From A Constructive Point Overall We Were Extremely Impressed With The Ala Carte Menu That We Dined From On 2 Evenings As A Chef Of 35 Years Myself  I Feel Your Overall Aa Rating Of 2 Rosettes Is Justified  However Parts Of Our Meals Were Extremely Well Thought Out  Well Balanced And Cooked To Perfection And Imho Deserve A 3 Aa Rating  What Does Unfortunately Let You Down  Is Your Pastry Is Not Quite To The Level Of Your Starters & Mains  That's Not To Say That It Was Not Enjoyable  Apart From The Pistachio Cake Dessert  The 3 Other Desserts Ordered Were To A Good Standard.  I Would Also  If I May  Advise That A Little More Consistacy Be Paid To Your Breakfast. Our Cooked Breakfast On Our First Morning Was Excellent  However We Were Quite Disappointed On Our Second Morning  With Over Cooked And Non Seasoned Scrambled Eggs  And An Egg Benedictine That Was Somewhat Bizzare  Served On A Hard Toasted Bread Roll? Not An English Muffin As Would Expect  2 Very Undercooked Poached Eggs On Top Of Ham And Spinach? ( Spinach Is Egg Floretine) Hollandaise Sauce And Then Topped With Your Chefs Favourite Micro Cress.( Chef  Please Use In Moderation  As You'll Get Heavily Marked Down On Your Next Aa Visit  As It Formed Part Of Every Dish We Ate Over The Weekend) Otherwise A Most Enjoyable Restaurant Experience  Well Done To All The Catering Staff; You Have The Makings Of A Great Restaurant   ,,,,,,
,703,The Service Was Very Slow On Our First Night Having To Wait Nearly An Hour For Our Main Course! A Sorbet Was Offered!!,,,,,,
,705,Ar Dinner We Found The Service A Little Too Attentive And Way To Many 'You're Welcome' ..... Breakfast On The Other Hand Was A Little Lacking In Service In Regard To No Staff On Arrival & Having To Find One To Order Our Breakfast (He Was Clearing Tables...) We Were In A Bit Of A Hurry And When We Told Him He Was Very Accommodating.,,,,,,
,706,We Have Taken The Gin Menu Twice. The First Time It Was Exceptional  The Second It Appeared To Have Dropped In Quality (I Even Pointed Out Missing Items - Like Gin Jelly). Have You Changed Kitchen Staff&Gt;,,,,,,
,710,Food And Service Was Good During The Evening Meal  But The Bill Took Too Long To Arrive. (Over 10 Minutes)  This Is A Shame As It Leaves The Lasting Impression Of The Evening As Poor. The Bill Was Also The Wrong One For Our Table. Please Try To Get The Bill To Your Guests As Soon As They Ask For It  And Do Not Leave Them Waiting. The Breakfast Staff Were Polite But Very Slow At Getting Tea/Toast And Cooked Items Out. It Was A Shame As The Food Was Good.,,,,,,
,711,Breakfast Not S Good As Last Time. Not As Stylishly Presented. Toast Was Awful Hard And Dry And Brittle. Not Quick In Filling Fruit Yogurt Etc At Buffet Tasting Menu Dinner Was Good  Just 5- 10 Minutes Too Slow Between Courses. Whole Meal Was 2.5 Hours Therefore Half An Hour Per Course When Only Tasting Portions - Needs To Be Quicker. Sevice Was Pleasant But A Little Perfuntory. No Interaction,,,,,,
,714,One Of The Best !,,,,,,
,716,Very Limited Menu.,,,,,,
,720,Scallops Was A Full Scallop And A Piece Of Scallop Which Is Not Very Clever Of You! Not Sure Why At Least 2 Full Scallops Were Served.  A Starter Portion Is Normally 3 And At Â£12 You Are At The Top Of The Pricing!,,,,,,
,721,Tasting Menu ...Most Courses Were Put On The Table Without Explanation Of The Content. Breakfast Was Very Slow Service And When It Did Arrive Only Half Of My Choice Arrived. The Buffet Was Depleted And Not Replenished.,,,,,,
,724,My Aunt And Uncle Are Still Talking About The Tasting Menu And How They Very Much Enjoyed It !!!!,,,,,,
,728,Wonderful Food Although A Tad Repetive In The Eveing.,,,,,,
,729,We Were Very Disappointed With The Taster Menu. Sorry To Say But The Meal Was Such A Let Down  Most Of The Courses Came With The Same Micro Salad Garnish  Service Was Good But Rather Rushed. We Asked For A Few Minutes Break Before The Next Course But It Still Arrived Within 2 Mins Of The Last One Breakfast: Was The Scrambled Egg Made Up From A Powder  It Did Not Look Taste Or Feel Like Fresh Eggs  We Would Love To Come And Stay Again But Don't Think We Would Eat In The Resturant,,,,,,
,735,The Service Was Very Hit And Miss. At Times It Was Over Zealous. At Other Times There Was No One To Be Seen. The Music In The Dining Room Was The Same Eric Clapton Tune Over And Over Again. It Was The Same Music At Breakfast.,,,,,,
,742,No.,,,,,,
,743,The Service Was Slow At Times,,,,,,
,746,We Had The 5 Course Gourmet Menu Which Was Interesting  But The Salmon Course Was Cold And Very Rare.,,,,,,
,752,Superb In Every Way,,,,,,
,754,The Breakfast Was A Little Overcooked As Though It Had Been Kept Warm Rather Then Cooked Fresh.,,,,,,
,755,Accomplished Cooking And Excellent Service. Altogether A Very Enjoyable Experience. Very Good Winelist.,,,,,,
,759,Honestly  We Were Disappointed. I Ordered A Martini As An Aperitif And You Had No Vermouth...In A Gin Bar! The Staff Were Mixed In Their Experience...The Young Ones Needed More Training Re: Pouring Wine/Where To Place Items. A Course Was Brought To Us And The Table Hadn't Been Cleared From The Previous Course.  The Breakfast On Sunday Morning Was Incredibly Slow.,,,,,,
,762,None Other Than Already Mentioned. I Will Be Back!,,,,,,
,763,Gin Fusion Menu Was Fantastic. I've Never Been A Gin Drinker But I Am Now Converted!,,,,,,
,766,We Had The Five Course Taster Meal. The Food Was Of A High Quality But Very Small Quantities. We Both Felt Like We Could Have Eaten Alot More. Please Note Either Of Us Have Big Appetites And Have Eaten Many Taster Menus At Other Restaurants. My Husband Did Ask To See If The Chef Could Cook Him A Further Large Course Such As Steak But The Kitchen Had Shut And They Could Only Offer A Cheeseboard. When Ordering Wine I Asked For A Bottle Of Veuve Cliquot And Pointed To The Exact Type On The Wine List. However  When The Bottle Arrived At The Table It Was Presented To My Husband Whom Assumed That Was What I Chose And Accepted It. However We Had Been Brought The Vintage Which Was Â£25 More. We Didnt Realise This Untill We Checked The Bill On Leaving The Hotel. I Do Hope This Was A Genuine Mistake And Not The Hotel Trying To Upsell. We Arrived At Breakfast At 9.45Am And Were Asked To Sit At A Table With Crumbs And Place Settings From The Previous Customers Which The Waiter Cleaned Up As I Sat There. I Couldnt See Why I Couldnt Have Been Sat At A Clean Table? The Breakfast Was Disappointing Apart From The Staff Who Were Very Friendly And Attentive. I Received The Wrong Fruit Juice  The Toast Was White Not Brown  The Kitchen Had Run Out Of Bananas For The Hotcake And Banana. As A Consequence We Were Offered Berries In The Hotcakes Instead. What Came Was A Dry Hotcake With A Very Slight Smear Of Jam Inside. The Coffee Was Extremely Weak Unlike The Coffee I Had The Night Before.   ,,,,,,
,767,The Issue With The Food Was That It Took Over An Hour To Be Served After Ordering. Far To Long Especially As Other Tables Were Served Before Us Although They Arrived After Us. We Had No Dietary Requirements So I Don't Know Why It Took So Long,,,,,,
,771,Some Was Exceptional  Some Less So.  Some Staff Were Great (Tall Chap With Glasses Who Was Gin Expert Went The Extra Mile) Others Less So. Had To Wait 20 Mins For Cup Of Tea At Table One Morning.,,,,,,
,774,We Were Very Disappointed With The Food In The Evening. Lobster Ravioli Was Completely Tasteless As Were The Vegetables Served With The Lamb.  The Restaurant Manager Seemed Rather Harassed And Service Was A Bit Haphazard.,,,,,,
,779,Disappointed. One Starter Was Served With Blue Cheese Missing. Lobster Ravioli Had Little Lobster Filling And Was Tasteless. Not Asked To Taste The Wine And Was Not Poured. The Serving Staff Need More Training.,,,,,,
,787,As Part Of Our 123 Package The Offer Stated That We Had A Complimentary Gin Cocktail. My Wife And I Are Not Particularly Gin Drinkers But The Gentleman Running The Bar Mentioned That We Could Have Any Other Drink We Liked And Offered My Wife A Glass Of Champagne. Superb  As That Is Her Favourite Drink. I Had A Glass Of Red Wine. That Was A Welcome And Delightful Start To Our Meal With You. Thank You.  ,,,,,,
,788,The Food Was Lovely. One Of The Staff Forgot To Clear Our Plates Away After The Entree But We Laughed It Off When The Mains Arrived And The Staff Were Trying To Serve Our Food.  They Were Apologetic But Very Polite And Dealt With It.  It Didn't Ruin Our Experience.  Staff Were Discreet But Attentive.,,,,,,
,796,As Above Breakfast Buffet Was Lacking,,,,,,
,797,See Previous Comments,,,,,,
,801,Again  Superb. Beautifully Presented And Well Cooked.,,,,,,
,803,First Night We Were Told The Chicken Was Off The Menu   Second Night Still Off The Menu We Were Told That The Chef Was Changing The Menus And That Was The Reason.  Poached Egg Must Have A Piece Of Toast Under It  Surely Not Just Put On The Plate.  ,,,,,,
,804,Friendly Staff  We Really Liked The Barman From Poland  He Introduced Us To Two New Gins.,,,,,,
,805,Extremely Good Service.,,,,,,
,806,The Bacon And Sausage Were Very Dry And Appeared To Have Been Kept Warm As Opposed Freshly Cooked. ,,,,,,
,813,The Gentlemen Who We Served Us At Breakfast Was Delightful,,,,,,
,814,Very Good Food And Service Served To A Very High Standard.,,,,,,
,816,The Staff Was Very Well Trained And Professional.,,,,,,
,823,Portion Size Improvement On Previous Visits,,,,,,
,826,Perhaps Another Starter As Only Three,,,,,,
,829,The Food Was A 6 Out Of 10. Ok But Not Memorable.,,,,,,
,830,Possibly May Need To Look At Breakfast Portion Sizes - I Know You Have To Keep An Eye On Costs But 1 Small Mushroom And Only 2 Triangles Of Toast (So 1 Slice) And No Hash Browns Weren't Quite To The Standards I'd Hoped For. ,,,,,,
,832,Comments As Previously Made On This Form.,,,,,,
,833,Excellent Atmosphere  Great Food  Wonderful Service.,,,,,,
,838,My Husband Has Recently Had A Heart Attack And Wasn't Up To Having Breakfast Downstairs - Staff Very Happy To Bring To Our Room (33) - A Lovely Treat To Have Breakfast In Bed!! Again Thank You.,,,,,,
,843,5 Course Tasting Menu Delicious. Fresh Fruit Salad At Breakfast Disappointing ,,,,,,
,844,The Gin And Tonic Recommended Was Excellent.  The Food Was Slightly Too Salted For My Taste But Not Unpleasant.  I Sateyd Two Nights And So The Chopices Were Limited - A Few More Main Courses Or A Changing Menu Would Be Welcome.,,,,,,
,846,The Waiter Was Great And Recommended A Lovely Gin. He Made Our Evening.,,,,,,
,847,See Previous Comments,,,,,,
,848,Upon My Request For A Meat Free Meal  I Was Not Disappointed In Any Way.  We Both Felt Like We Had A Very Special Treat!,,,,,,
,850,Dinner Service Was Poor For The Second Time  Head Waiter Was Grumpy As Was The Waitress. It Doesn't Matter How Good The Food Is If The Person Serving It Is Clearly Not Enjoying Themselves.   Breakfast Was Great Staff Very Friendly,,,,,,
,852,Very Pleasantly Surprised With The Content Of The Menu And The Quality And Presentation Of The Food. Excellent Value For Money,,,,,,
,854,Dinner Was Not Memorable  Breakfast Was,,,,,,
,857,Let Down By Dining Room Staff. ,,,,,,
,858,As Before   Lovely Setting  Good Food  The Service Could Be Sharper,,,,,,
,862,Told We Had Booked The Taster Menu~ Untrue. Used The A La Carte With Its Limited Offering . Seasonal Greens Were Ordered As A Side And Were Not Edible As Was The Over Balance Of Greens Already On Plate. Waitress Was Pleasant But Obviously Inexperienced . The Hovering Suited Male Was Not Interested In His Customers,,,,,,
,866,Both Evening Meal And Breakfast Were Excellent. We Did Have Three Attempts On Getting Our Evening Meal  But It Was  Not An Issue And The Staff Were Very Good In The Way They Handled The Mistake. Breakfast Was Obviously Cooked To Order And Very Tasty,,,,,,
,869,Outstanding!  I Need The Recipe For Those Duck Fat Potatoes!!!  We Loved Absolutely Every Meal And Were Very Impressed With Our Dining Experiences.,,,,,,
,871,The Staff Were Very Attentive ,,,,,,
,876,We Were Looking Forward To The Pancakes For Breakfast  But These Were "Finished" When We Arrived  My Wife's Next Choice Was Also Off The Menu  So She Went For The Kippers Which Were A Nice Third Choice. There Were No Water Glasses On The Tables And We Had To Ask For Them Which Took Ten Minutes As They Were Too Busy To Check On Us! We Also Had To Ask For Orange Juice  And When I Asked For A Coffee  It Never Arrived  And The Restaurant  Shut With No One Checking If Everything Was Ok!  Dinner Was Excellent And Very Enjoyable - The Gin Fusion Menu Was Superb  But The Desert Was A Let Down And A Complete Contrast To The Starter And Meal - You Would've Got A 'Strongly Agree' If The Desert Was Up To The Same Standard.,,,,,,
,877,The Sampling Menu Was Good  However The Fillet Beef Was Really Not Up To Scratch... It Was Cooked Perfectly But A Rather Tough Piece Of Meat. The Dessert - Chocolate -  Was A Bit Too Large & Very Rich. ,,,,,,
,882,Breakfast Wasn't Particularly Allergy Friendly - As A Lacto An Gluten Intolerant Person It Was Quite Tricky Finding Something To Eat. I'd Suggest Spelt Bread As An Easy Solution With Salmon And Eggs For Example. ,,,,,,
,884,The Food Was Not Of Previous High Standard. The Service Was Very Slow   Even At Breakfast - I Do Appreciate It Was Being Individually Prepared. The Staff Were Friendly But Not Professional.,,,,,,
,887,Dinner Was Average.....And Disappointing For The Price. Breakfast Self-Service Was Fair. The Cooked Breakfast On Both Mornings Was Not As Ordered  Despite Repeating To Ensure The Waitress Had Taken The Order Correctly. Breakfast Took Far To Long To Come Give That You Were Well Staffed And Had A Low Cover Count Both Days When We Ate. Coffee Was Very Poor On The Sunday. ,,,,,,
,889,New Year's Eve Was Great. However We Mentioned At Reception The Previous Evening Being Somewhat Scatty And Remarkably Slow. We Were A Party Of 8 - Not That Many. 3/4 Hour After We Sat Down We Still Had No Bread. The Meal Was So Slow We Left At About 11 Rather Than Wait For Coffee. The Youngest Of Our Party Was 13 So We Didn't Want Such A Late Night. We Were Brought The Wrong Food Several Times And Cheeses Came Long After The Other Desserts  So It Was Not A Relaxing Evening. ,,,,,,
,890,At Breakfast We Didn't Notice Any Fruit Juice Labels.  This Would Be Helpful For Dietary Requirements.,,,,,,
,891,It Was All Fine And Attentive.,,,,,,
,892,The Gala Dinner Food Was Better Than Expected Being Almost Fine Dining Standard - For Such Large Number Catering It Was Exceptional. Breakfast (Not Brunch?) Again Was Excellent  With A Very Good And Interesting Choice Of Dishes.,,,,,,
,893,We Ate In The Restaurant On The Saturday Night And The Service Was Very Good  The Food Was Fine But Not Outstanding. The Breakfast Service Seemed A Little Chaotic On The Sunday Morning But We Were In No Rush So That Didn't Matter And The Food Was Good. On Monday Morning The Service Was Much Better And The Food Was Good Again. ,,,,,,
,894,We Thought The Dinner Was Excellent And Interesting Especially For Me As A Vegetarian. To Have Such Choice Is Unusual.,,,,,,
,895,We Found The Food Improved On Our Last Visit - Which Was Great To See.  However Just A Couple Of Things To Note: Breakfasts - The Buffet Style Choice Was Most Improved And Didn't Run Out Of Things Such As The Pastries  If You Came Down Later To Breakfast.  The Cooked Breakfasts Were Good Too.  We Were There As Part Of The New Year Package And It Perhaps Might Have  Been An Idea To Give The Guests A Small Timetable Of Times For Meals (As Most Of Us Welcomed The Later Breakfast/Brunch Idea On New Year's Day But We Didn't Know About It Ahead Of Time)  We Were Also Unaware Of The Gin Tasting Session That Was Included In The Package But We Weren't Able To Join  As We Found Out About It Too Late.  Courtyard Gin Bar - The Recommendations On The Gins Were Excellent And We Really Enjoyed The Knowledge And The Recommends On Each Night.  We Did Dine There On One Of Our Nights And Had An Ok Meal........ It Would Have Been Nice To Have Seen Something A Little Lighter (Rather Than Just A Choice Of Burger Or Fish And Chips Or Pasta).  Also The Fish We Did Have Was Rather Over Cooked Which Made It Quite Dry.  Restaurant - Both The New Year Eve Package Dinners Were Interesting  But We Did Find It Hard To Make A Wine Choice For The New Year's Eve Dinner  As There Was Both The Need For A White And A Red Wine  But As There Was Only Two Of Us  We Didn't Want To Order Two Whole Bottles And Also The Toasting Champagne.  Could We Suggest That Perhaps You Included A Suggested Accompanying Wine By The Glass With Each Course  Which I Am Sure That A Number Of The Other Couples May Have Welcomed Too?  Your Wine List Has A Very Limited Number Of Wines By The Glass Or Even Half Bottles.  (Just One Small Point About The Canapes - It Would Have Been Nice To See Them Served With Paper Napkins - Everyone Was Dressed For Dinner And Had No Where To Wipe Sticky Fingers From The Canapes.)  We Do Love The Tea And Coffee Service - Please Do Keep This.  It Was Always Prompt And Beautifully Served.  ,,,,,,
,896,The Service Was A Bit Slow On Our First Night  However The Staff Were Apologetic And Sympathetic.,,,,,,
,897,Disappointed That Flora Or Other Non Dairy Spread Was Not Available At Breakfast. ,,,,,,
,898,Very Nice Food; However The Dinner Menu Was Almost Exactly The Same On Our Second Night  Which Was A Pity. This May Have Been Due To Dining In The Bar Or Because It Was The Weekend  Nevertheless It Would Have Been Nice To See A Completely Different Choice.,,,,,,
,899,Very Good Food ,,,,,,
,901,The Tasting Menu Was Good But Not Exciting - But There Were 2 Large Parties Dining That Night. The A La Carte We Had The Next Evening Was Excellent  Well Cooked And Presented.,,,,,,
,904,Food Was Very Good But Service Was Alright. No Muffins For The Eggs Benedict. ,,,,,,
,905,Dinner Fabulous Except For Very Slow Service. Breakfast Average. My Smoked Haddock Was Raw  Not Smoked!,,,,,,
,907,Please See Earlier Comments Regarding Service.,,,,,,
,909,It Would Have Been V Helpful If The Wine Waiter Had Actually Discussed The Wine Choices That Went With Each Course - Likewise At The Bar More Interaction About The Choice Of Gins Would Have Been Very Helpful.,,,,,,
,910,Our Main Meal And Wine Was Very Good  But Dessert Was Less Than Ideal.   It Was Not As Described On The Menu Or By The Waiter When Asked.  And When Questioned  The Waiter Was Somewhat Dismissive.  In Fairness  He Did Offer To Bring Another Dessert - But The Selection For Dessert Was Not Very Good So There Was Nothing Else We Wanted.   Also  After We Arrived And Settled In - I Came Downstairs To Make A Dinner Reservation With Reception.  When We Arrived For Dinner They Did Not Have Our Name Down On The Reservation List...The Wait Staff Seemed Confused And Hesitant.  Although Not A Big Deal...And They Sat Us ...It Was A Bit Offputting For The Beginning Of The Experience. ,,,,,,
,918,Waiting Staff Did Not Know Their Food  Tasting Menu Was Just Put Down And When Asked The Waiting Staff Did Not Know What The Dishes Were. Fish Course Was Served Cold. The Wine Flight Arrived After Each Course Rather Than Before Or With It. The Toast For Breakfast Arrived After Hot Food Finished Despite Asking For It With,,,,,,
,922,Evening Meal (5 Course Tasting Menu) Was Entirely Satisfactory  Good Rather Than Outstanding. Breakfast Service Was Very Slow (Though You Were Busy And The Food  Particularly The Bacon Was Very Dry. ,,,,,,
,925,See Earlier Comments!,,,,,,
,928,Dinner Seemed A Little Less 'Special' Than Previous Visits  More Straightforward Food But Still Good.,,,,,,
,929,Shall Return  In The Future - Better Than Expected,,,,,,
,932,None,,,,,,
,933,Whislt The Service In The Restuarant Was Friendly It Was Quite Slow And We Often Had To Ask Or Remind The Waitress Of Things
Eg.
- We Had To Ask Twice For Some Water
- Our Gins Did Not Arrive With The Starters For The Gin Fusion Menu - Again We Had To Ask
- At Breakfast We Waited A Long Time For A Waitress And Then She Asked For Our Order Before Even Showing Us The Menu
- When The Breakfast Arrived We Didn't Actually Get The Items We Had Asked For ,,,,,,
,934,Background Music Was Too Loud -- Not Really Necessary In Rooms With Such A Pleasant Ambience.

Proper Coat Hangers In The Bedroom Would Be Welcome.

It Was Not Clear Whether We Could Have Ordered Our Meal Over Drinks (Which We Prefer) Before Going In To Dinner.

To Nit Pick: Orange Juice At Breakfast Was Not Freshly Squeezed As Promised.,,,,,,
,935,The Egg Was Requested To Be Left Off One Of Our One Of My Dinner Courses  But It Came With The Egg.
The Black Pudding At Breakfast Was Under Cooked,,,,,,
,936,Please See Previous Comments Re Food. ,,,,,,
,937,No Cold Meats For Continental Breakfast?,,,,,,
,939,See Comment Above,,,,,,
,940,We Could Not Feel Any More Looked After,,,,,,
,941,Dining Area Lacking It Atmosphere  Too White/Bright  Need Muted Lighting In The Evening,,,,,,
,943,Waiter Service Was Very Professional And Attentive.,,,,,,
,944,Just One Young Female Waitress  Didn't Speak To Us At All And Rushed Us A Bit  Which We Really Only Noticed Because Everyone Else Was So Friendly And Polite. However I Must Add That This Did Not Have Any Real Impact On A Fabulous Dining Experience.,,,,,,
,945,The Gin Fusion Menu At Dinner Was A Brilliant Experience - Delicious Food And So Well Matched With The Different Gins. 
Breakfast Was Very Tasty Too - Our Only Quibble Was That Portion Size Was Not Especially Generous (I Chose Not To Have The Sausage  Bacon Or Black Pudding  So It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Second Egg).,,,,,,
,946,Did Not Like The Hash Brown At Breakfast,,,,,,
,947,We Had Burgers So The Word "Exceptional" Does Not Seem Appropriate,,,,,,
,949,Very Well Presented ,,,,,,
,951,Would Recommend That When Using The Private Dining Room That If Staying The Guests Using The Private Dining Room Are Put Above This Area Therefore Not Disturbing Other Guests Staying. ,,,,,,
,952,We Had A Very Enjoyable Meal But We Cannot Agree That It Was Exceptional,,,,,,
,962,The  Buffet Selection Was Disappointing  The Bacon Difficult To Eat And Egg Had So Much Pepper  I Couldn't Eat It.,,,,,,
,963,Breakfast Buffet Selection Was Disappointing The Bacon Difficult To Eat And Pepper Used Too Liberally On The Egg.,,,,,,
,967,Please See My Comments At The Start Of The Questionnaire,,,,,,
,968,Wasn't Sure What Cheese Charcuterie Was Available For Continental Breakfast,,,,,,
