,76,It Is A Nice Place To Bring People But Some People From The Various Countries My People Are From Don't Appreciate An Old Building.  It Is Hard For Them To See Small  Dark  Overly Hot With No Air Con As Luxurious And To Have Minimal Service At The Bar And Almost No Service At Breakfast Is To Them Unacceptable.  I Discovered That One Of Your Rooms - It May Be 25? Is Awful And I Would Never Have Put Anyone In That Room If I Had Known What It Was Like.  To Have No Window  A Large Air Con Unit Dominating The Room  Powering Out Cold Air And The Option Of Not Having It On Meaning You Are Styfling Hot Is Not Acceptable At All.,,,,,,
