,24,The Young Lady At Reception,,,,,,
,25,On Entering The Gin Bar On Our First Evening  We Were In Need Of An Extra 2 Chairs.  One Of The Young Guys From Reception (Who Had Come To Take A Couple Of Logs) Was There And So I Asked Him If He Would Be Able To Organise The Chairs For Us As We Were Waiting To Be Seated.  He Told Me To Speak To The Bar Man (Who Already Had A Queue Of People And Was Very Busy) And Walked Away.  I Thought This Was A Tad Rude.   We Had To Wait 10 Minutes Before My Husband And Daughter Could Sit Down.  I Did Not Think It My Husband's Job To Cart 2 Chairs Over The Heads Of People Who Were Already Sitting Quietly Drinking In The Next Room.,,,,,,
,27,The Male Waiters In The Restaurant Were Fantastic.,,,,,,
,28,Staff Seemed Unsure Of Who Was Responsible For Aspects Of Our Service Requirements.,,,,,,
,31,The Receptionist Upon Arrival (Whose Name Escapes Us!),,,,,,
,32,Ana - Very Helpful Pre- Arrival The Head Waiter In The Evening Was Excellent - Frecnh Maybe  Didn't Catch His Name The Head Waiter In Breakfast (Wears A Suits - 40'S In Age I'd Say) Was Very Helpful And Attentive),,,,,,
,36,The Gentleman On Reception When We Left. He Was Apologetic About Our Toilet Smelling Of Urine And Seemed Genuine.,,,,,,
,42,The Young Woman On Reception In The Mornings Could Not Have Been More Helpful  And In Particular She Pointed Out  Quite Without Pressure From Me  That There Was A Room Discount For Single Occupancy. I Said That  Having Booked The Room In Good Faith At The Full Price  I Should Pay That Amount  But She Insisted  And Amended My Account. I Was Impressed And Grateful.,,,,,,
,44,Lewis Was Very Helpful With Our Booking And Was A Pleasure To Meet Him,,,,,,
,45,Service Was Flawless But Not In Your Face. Just Nice And Relaxed.,,,,,,

,69,The Receptionist Was Very Good And Also The Gentleman In The Bar Who Took Our Order For Drinks In The Bar And Restaurant Was Very Personable And Knowledgeable About The Wines. We Had Asked For A Glass Of Wine To Suit Each Of Our Selections And Courses. He Explained Very Well What The Wines Were For Our Starter And Why They Had Been Chosen. Unfortunately  Someone Else Brought The Wine For Our Main Course And Just Plonked Them Down Without Telling Us What They Were!,,,,,,

,82,Female Receptionist In The Morning Was Particularly Pleasant And Helpful.,,,,,,
,86,Lack Of Staff Was The Key.  They Were All Polite  But So Rushed That They Could Not Be Attentive  Or Make Guests Feel Really Well Looked After.  Danny The Restaurant Manager Was Excellent And Clearly Knows What Is Needed  If Only He Had The Resources To Accomplish It.  The Fact That The Hotel Manager  Pete  Was Having To Serve And Clear  At Breakfast Exemplifies The Problems!,,,,,,

,113,Guy On Reception When I Arrived   May Be Called Darren Or Warren?,,,,,,
,122,The Husband And Wife Team You Have Are Very Good - And Have Some Great Hospitality Skills.  James In The Bar Was Very Knowledgeable But Not Very Presentable And No One Else Appears To Know About The Gin Bar If He Isn't There.  As This Is One Of Your 'Selling Points' I Would Have Expected That All Staff Who Are Working In The Bar Have The Same High Level Of Knowledge.,,,,,,
,125,All The Staff Were Engaged And Helpful.,,,,,,
,135,Ben,,,,,,
,136,Daniel Was Excellent  He Was Hosting The Bar And Was Friendly  Knowledgeable And Proffesional. He Is Definately An Assett To The Business.,,,,,,

,171,I Would Especially Like To Acknowledge Pete Saunders; Didier (I Don't Know His Surname) And The Waiter Who Was Serving Breakfast In The Morning.  The Receptionist (I Think It Was Dana) Too.  These Were The Staff We Had Most Contact With And Were Exceptional.  The Other Waiters/Waitresses Were Also Very Good But We Didn't Have As Much Contact With Them.,,,,,,
,174,All The Staff Were Excellent Apart From The Bar Man In The Gin Bar Who Didn't Seem Too Interested In Being At Work Or Offering Any Advice Or Recommendations In The World Renowned Gin Bar.  Very Disappointed In The Service Provided By This Individual.,,,,,,

,198,Don't Know His Name But A Tall Waiter Was Very Chatty And Seemed To Be Very Knowledgeable Regarding The Menu And The Hotel Itself  He Seems To Be An Asset  Although All The Staff Were Very Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,,
,201,Everyone Was Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,,
,205,All Very Nice,,,,,,
,209,The Receptionist Was Excellent - Can't Remember Her Name (Would Have Been Monday 6Th),,,,,,

Unfortunately I Do Not Know His Name  But He Was Present Both Mornings And Tended To Greet All Residents.,,,,,,
,230,We Particularly Like The Waiter At Breakfast  As On Our Last Visit. Having Said That The Staff Are All Very Good. Do Not Have An Issue With The Slightly Unusual Practice Of Adding A Service Charge As The Service Merits It.,,,,,,

Also  We Arrived Early And Left Our Luggage With Reception While We Attended A Family Wedding.

,247,All Were Really Super,,,,,,
,248,The Barman Was Very Knowledgeable About The Gin Stock  And Gave Us Some Good Advice.,,,,,,
,249,Not Sure Where To Add This But  I Ordered A Gin That I Wanted To Try  But Was Not Given A Choice Of Tonic  The Barman Chose My Tonic For Me  Ie He Didn't Offer Me A Choice He Just Poured One Before I Knew What He Was Doing. It Was Too Sweet For Me As I Drink Low Cal  Ie Fevertree Low And Didn't Enjoy My Â£11.45 Gin & Tonic As A Result! I Should Have Said At The Time But As I Said I Didn't Want To Cause A Fuss. I Think A Full Choice Should Be Offered   Guests May Have Odd Tastes But We Are The Paying Guests!,,,,,,

Peter Even Slipped It Under The Door After Calling To Inform Us It Had Been Found Rather Than Disturb Us.,,,,,,
,275,The Member Of Staff Serving At The Gin Bar On Sunday Afternoon. He Said That He Was Not The Normal Bartender But You Wouldn't Have Known As He Was Extremely Knowledgable And Gave Us Great Advice On Which Gins To Try.
