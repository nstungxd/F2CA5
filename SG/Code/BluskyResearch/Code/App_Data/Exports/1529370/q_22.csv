,----------------------,,,,,,,
,2,There Was A Small Error On The Bill On Checkout But This Was Rectified Promptly And Did Not Detract Form Our Overall Experience.,,,,,,
,4,None,,,,,,
,7,A Petty Comment But The Fire In The Reception Area Was Very Smoky And Smelly And  Filled Both The Reception And Sitting Area Behind With An Unpleasant Air- We Didnt Use The Sitting Area As A Consequence,,,,,,
,10,Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.,,,,,,
,18,Again Temperature Was The Problem - Understandable Due To Weather In Most Aspects Except That Money Was Paid For A 'Restful'  Night,,,,,,
,24,Bathroom Products Were Not Up To The Hotel I Thought,,,,,,
,25,We Were Disappointed With The Standard Of The Room We Were Allocated Given The Beautiful Pictures We Had Seen On The Internet.  The Study Was Very Small And We Struggled During The Day To Get A Seat For The 3 Of Us As People From The Public Were There Having Meetings Both Days Of Our Stay.  The Sofa In The Corridor Offered Alternative Seating But Was Opposite The Toilets So We Decided To Give It A Miss And Just Went Back To Our Room.  Our Room Was Clean But I Did Notice Cobwebs On The Ceiling.  It Would Be Good To Get Rid Of Those For Next Guests.  Overall We Had A Good Time.  The Staff Were Brilliant With The Exception Of That One Guy.  I'm Sorry I Did Not Get His Name.,,,,,,
,27,We Had Dinner As Part Of Our Package But Was Charged Another Â£10 For A Coffee And Tea At The End Of Our Meal.  We Thought This Would Be Either Served As Part Of The Meal Or If We Had Ordered It In Our Room  This Would Be Complimentary.,,,,,,
,31,The Breakfast Experience Described Above  And Which Coloured Our Overall Opinion.,,,,,,
,36,Cleaned The Toilet Properly And Had Happier More Friendly Wait Staff,,,,,,
,40,Not To Run Out Of Cooked Breakfast Items By 8.45 Am,,,,,,
,42,Make The Jam-Pots Less Sticky?  :-),,,,,,
,44,I Just Thought The Hotel Was Going To Be More Luxurious. Then Again The Other Rooms That Weren't Meant For Disabled People May Have Been More Luxurious.  As We Have No Disabilities The Room Was Not To Our Needs.,,,,,,
,49,Better Staff Training Ie Dirty Plates Left On Table When Serving Next Course Especially At Breakfast,,,,,,
,50,The Staff Need Better Training In The Restaurant.,,,,,,
,51,The Staff Level Either Need Increasing Or A Manager Needs To Be Around To Organise The Staff Better.,,,,,,
,52,Service Was Very Slow.,,,,,,
,54,No,,,,,,
,57,When We Were Checking Out We Wanted To Spend About Half An Hour In The Lounge And Were Advised That It Was Booked Out For A Private Function So We Sat In The Bar. We Passed The Lounge As We Left And It Was Not Occupied By Anyone. The Final Impression Was A Little Diminished By This.  Also  My Mother Is Becoming Less Able And I Didn't Realise That The Stairs Were So Steep In The Building So I Wouldn't Use The Hotel If I Was Visiting With Someone With Restrictions In Their Mobility. That Is Not The Fault Of The Hotel But May Be Worth Pointing Out To Customers When They Book.,,,,,,
,63,Please Can You Improve Your Bedrooms  I Have Many Friends Who Have Given Up On 'The Feathers' And Regularly Stay At Another Hotel In Woostock. Please Can Afternoon Tea Be Improved  Clotted Cream Which Had Gone Off And No Cakes Just Pieces Of Bread Or Biscuit  Very Strange.,,,,,,
,68,Nothing Really Comes To Mind!,,,,,,
,69,As Mentioned In Previous Notes  The Only Disappointing Thing Was That The Waiting Staff Seemed A Bit Oblivious As Menu Changes  Etc. At Breakfast We Asked For Fresh Fruit Salad (Which Should Have Been With The Buffet Items) And At First We Were Told 'We Usually Have It So Not Sure Why There Isn't Any'. A Senior Staff Member Then Made Sure That Some Was Made But The Initial Response Was Not Very Good. Also  Although The Cooked Breakfast Was Excellent The Toast Was Brought To Us While We Were Still Eating Cereals And Therefore Ended Up Being Stone Cold By The Time We Ate It.,,,,,,
,70,I Think You Have A Lovely Hotel  In A Great Location  But I Think That For The Price You Want To Charge For The Style Of Room We Stayed In Sets People's Expectations Far Too High  So Hence We Were Disappointed When We Came To Pay The Bill - And Whilst The Evening Meal Was Lovely  Charging Â£9.50 For 2 Filter Coffees (Especially When There Is No Facility For Making Your Own In The Room) Is Too High. And Although The Staff Were Not Rude At All  They Didn't Appear Happy In Their Work Either!,,,,,,
,76,Breakfast Situation  Being Honest About The Air Con Unit Bedroom  Improving The Wifi In All Parts Of The Hotel And Staffing The Bar 100% Of The Time.,,,,,,
,80,No  It Was Fine,,,,,,
,81,Feathers Was Renowned For Good Food And In Previous Visits It Lived Up To It. This Visit Came As A Surprise. Tasting Menu Extremely Mediocre....At Least 2 Of The Dishes Were On A Bed Of Spinach...Original! Breakfast No Fruit Juice On Display. Asked For A Mixed Brown And White Toast And Got All White. No Butter . Even I Can Do Fried Eggs Without Burning Them.,,,,,,
,82,Already Covered Most Aspects But Felt Overall Service Could Have Been More Professional.,,,,,,
,85,No,,,,,,
,86,Employ More Staff!,,,,,,
,88,We Enjoyed Our Stay With You And We Will Return  Your Hotel And Woodstock Is Charming But Would Really Like To See A More Varied Menu And Hopefully Better Internet Reception.,,,,,,
,89,Apart From Offering A Slightly Larger Menu (Just A Bit Limited If You're Staying 2/3 Days Or More) We Had A Very Pleasant Stay.  We Will Certainly Return As Your Hotel And Woodstock Is Charming.,,,,,,
,93,The Only Thing We Were Less Than Impressed With Was The Bar  As There Is Very Little Atmosphere In There.  We Had A Drink In There When We Returned From Blenheim In The Afternoon  But It Did Not Inspire Us To Return There Before Dinner  So We Went Next Door To The Woodstock Arms!,,,,,,
,96,During The Morning Most Of The Corridors Were  Full Of Obstacles Such As Linen Bags  Bottles For Bottling Up The Bar. We Had To Move Some Of These To Get Our Suitcases Down The Stairs. During Breakfast The Breakfast Room Was Reconstructed To Set Upna Long Table  Presumably For A Lunch Meeting/Party. I Felt Like I Was In A Building Site,,,,,,
,102,There Was Nothing Outstanding In My Experience Considering The Cost Which Was Rather High. I Was Particularly Upset With The Breakfast When One Of My Group(Six Friends Having A Reunion) Found That As She Had Ordered Porridge She Could Not Have Any Other Additional Hot Food Without Paying Extra. This Seemed Extraordinary And I Have Never Come Across Such Pettiness In A Hotel Of Your Reputation. I Had Done The Booking And I Felt Responsible For The Well-Being Of The Party And Was Let Down By Such A Policy.,,,,,,
,104,Those Who Opt For Porridge Might Do So For Healthy Reasons  So Maybe The Cream Should Be Optional? Only A Small Thing.,,,,,,
,106,As We Were Downgraded To A Lower Standard Room Because Of The Noise  It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had Some Recognition Of That Fact.  After Stating How We Felt On Check-Out The Â£5 Dinner Supplement Was Removed From The Bill - Big Deal!,,,,,,
,109,Only Wish The Internet Was Better And In The Room,,,,,,
,111,I Would Have Liked To Have Been Able To Upgrade To A Suite,,,,,,
,113,Lighter Early Evening Meal Choices For People With Dietary Issues.(I Canot Eat A Full Meal Afte 6Pm But My Choice Of 'Lite Bites' Was Rather Limited.),,,,,,
,114,Better Food At Dunner,,,,,,
,122,We Had A Lovely Stay But There Were Some Quirks Which Were About The Low Level Of Attention To Detail Which Is Expected For The Prices You Are Charging.  For Example We Decided To Have A Gin When Returning To The Hotel Before Getting Ready For Dinner (It Was About 5Pm) And We Were Sitting In The Study Area  Happy To Go To The Bar To Order But We Then Had To Carry The Glasses And Bottles To Our Table  Rather Than Them Being Served. ,,,,,,
,126,1St Breakfast In Room (Toast Only And Small Quantity) No Cups Or Spoons And Tea Cold By The Time It Arrived 2Nd Day Had To Chase For Breakfast Twice And Waited For Over An Hour.,,,,,,
,137,My Only Commnet Is That I Find The Dinner Menu Rather Expensive For My Requirements  But Acknowledge That This Is Only A Personal View. Otherwise I Make This A Regular Stay.,,,,,,
,139,We Are Both In Our 60'S And Were Staying On The Second Floor Up Some Narrow Stairs - So Someone To Take Our Luggage To The Room Would Have Been Good.,,,,,,
,140,We Waited For Ages In Bar To Get Served  Nobody Around - About 10Pm,,,,,,
,143,Rectify The Noise Element In Room 14.  Inform Guests Making The Booking About Rooms Available.,,,,,,
,144,Please Improve Service And Food Consistency At Breakfast,,,,,,
,146,Only Real Problem Was The Heating - Very Very Hot And The Plumbing Is Also Very Noisy.,,,,,,
,147,We Were Only Staying One Night But Didn't Really See Many Members Of Staff. The Decor Is Lovely But It Was A Cold Wet Evening And It Would Have Been Lovely If The Fire Had Been On In The Reception Area And A Member Of Staff Had Been There To Welcome Us.,,,,,,
,149,Parking Was A Bit Of An Issue When We Arrived But I Appreciate There Is Little You Can Do About That!,,,,,,
,150,Breakfast Wasn't That Great. I Had Eggs Benedict & The Bread Used Was Very Strange!,,,,,,
,151,See Above,,,,,,
,155,Nothing,,,,,,
,156,Overall Excellent. Only Two Observations Would Be  As Previously Mentioned  There Should Be Tea / Coffee Facilities In The Room And The Service At Breakfast Was Very Slow.,,,,,,
,161,It Will Be Great When Wi-Fi Is Available Throughout The Hotel,,,,,,
,164,Better Food And Service,,,,,,
,171,No,,,,,,
,178,Nono,,,,,,
,179,Carry On With This Excellent Customer Service It Made A Refreshing Change,,,,,,
,181,Shutters On The Windows Would Have Been Great!,,,,,,
,183,Just Down Pillows!,,,,,,
,184,Breakfast Service Was Very Slow And Â£8 For A Couple Of Coffees In The Bar Seemed A Little Steep But Overall A Pleasant Stay.,,,,,,
,186,Not Sure We Particularly Like The Automatic Service Charge Added To Restaurant Charge. Customers Should Be Trusted To Leave An Appropriate Tip.,,,,,,
,187,We Would Have Preferred To Sleep-In But We Were Woken Up Before 7Am With A Pot Of Tea - Room Service Which We Did Not Order.  My Husband Was Expecting The Breakfast To Meet The Exceptional Standard He Had Experienced On His Previous Stay But This Time Was A Little Disappointed.,,,,,,
,188,Each Time We Were In The Bar Lounge Areas I Had To Go And Look For A Member Of Staff To Serve Us. When They Came  It Was Good Service  But I Think That The Service Is More Responsive To Request Rather Than Naturally Good And Pre-Emptive Of The Customers Needs.,,,,,,
,189,No,,,,,,
,192,We Paid Â£159 For One Night Dinner Bed And Breakfast On A Special Offer. This Represented Reasonable Value In Our Opinion But The Experience Was Not One That We Would Repeat. We Have Eaten And Stayed At Hotels Of Similar And Higher Quality And Had Much Better Food And Accomodation For The Same Or Less Cost.,,,,,,
,193,Improve Service On Breakfast A Bit And Make Sure The Bill Is Accurate On The Way Out!  It Took The Receptionist Three Attempts To Get Ours Right!,,,,,,
,199,Better Service At Breakfast. Apologies At Check Out For The Inconvenience Of Lack Of Water In Suite 1 Rather Than A Comment About A Power Cut ( Which Was Not The Case).,,,,,,
,202,It Was A Really Nice Experience - Don't Get Me Wrong. But We Had Hoped For Something More Particular. Woodstock Is One Of My Very  Very Favourite Places And I Wanted To Share It. We Chose You Of The Great Alternatives Because The Idea Of A Crazy 'Guinness Book Of Records' Gin Bar Was Fabulous. We Wanted To Relax  Sit There  Chat With A Bar Man. Get Him To Talk Us Through Some Flavours And Experiment  Then Have A Great Meal. But It Felt Less Bar Plus Restaurant Than A General Bistro/Restaurant Experience. Oddly  The Style Of Your Study Would Make A Better Start For Your Bar.,,,,,,
,213,Service In The Bar  End Of Dinner And At Breakfast Where We Had To Ask If We Could Sit Anywhere  Had To Ask For Toast And Were Not Offered Any Condiments.,,,,,,
,215,No,,,,,,
,217,The Food At Breakfast On Both Mornings Was Very Good. The Service On The Sunday Morning Was Very Poor - No One Seemed To In Charge We Had To Ask Twice For Water We Asked For More Toast Towards The End But None Arrived. Staff Never Looked At The Table To See If Anything Needed Replacing - Usually When You Ask For More Toast You Will Require More Butter! The Service On The Monday Morning At Breakfast Was Excellent - The Young Man/Manager Was Really On The Ball.,,,,,,
,219,Free Wireless Internet In The Room,,,,,,
,222,We Would Have Appreciated Tea Making Facilities. Our Room Was Really Too Hot Even Though We Had A Fan.,,,,,,
,226,Breakfast In Bed? /Jk,,,,,,
,228,Issue With Noise From A Late Running Party Below. Gin Bar Service Was Poor As My Girlfriend Was Ignored At The Bar. Other Than This The Service Was Fantastic.,,,,,,
,230,No,,,,,,
,232,Tea Making Facilities In The Room Would Have Been Lovely Because I Woke In The Early Hours And Could Have Done With A Kettle.,,,,,,
,233,No,,,,,,
,235,I Was Disappointed With Your Wifi That Was More Or Less Non Existent Throughout Our Stay  Although I Was Led To Believe That This And Mobile Phone Reception Was A Common Problem In The Woodstock Area.,,,,,,
,242,It Would Have Been Helpful To Receive E-Mail Confirmation Of My Booking Promptly  Instead Of Only At The Second Request.,,,,,,
,244,Just A Small Point: We Were Offered Tea In Our Room On Check-In.  I Was Unsure Whether This Was Complimentary And Didn't Like To Ask.  Perhaps Your Staff Could Make It Clear Whether Or Not The Tea Offered Is Complimentary To Avoid Embarassment Or Confusion For Guests.,,,,,,
,248,Please Put A Bin In The Garden Area.,,,,,,
,249,We Had Coffee But Didn't Get Petitfour  As Other Guests Did.,,,,,,
,253,I Think I Have Covered The Areas That We Were Not Happy With,,,,,,
,257,Wifi As Previously Mentioned.,,,,,,
,259,Stop The Snow So We Could Have Gone To Belhaim Palace!!!!,,,,,,
,263,Have Your Own Car Park Or Provide More Information To Assist Guests E.G. That 2 & 3 Hrs Parking Restrictions Can Be Ignored.  It Was Impossible To Park In Woodstock At Some Times On Sat 3Rd Aug.,,,,,,
,268,Not That I Can Think Of!,,,,,,
,270,The Final Bill Was Confusing Because We Never Knew For Sure What The Package Comprised.  We Were Surprised By The Service Charge 10% Of The Total Cost Of The Stay - This We Should Have Queried And At Least Checked That The Staff Actually Receive The Full Amount Taken - If Not  We Would Not Have Paid.  Th Staff Certainly Earn The Amount We Paid,,,,,,
,276,Much Better Dining Experience  Although Breakfast Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,277,Our Stay With You Was On Special Offer So We Felt It Was Very Good Value  However If We Had Been Paying The Normal Price We Feel It May Not Have Been As The Restaurant Does Not Live Up To Its Recommendations.  Also The Coffee Served In The Gin Bar Is Very Poor.,,,,,,
,278,Upgrade To Suites If There Were Not Used.,,,,,,
,281,Breakfast Was Not As Good As When We Visited In The Past  And Conducting An Interview In The Lounge When Guests Are Present Is Very Poor.,,,,,,
,286,Just A Little More Attention To Detail In The Restaurant.,,,,,,
,288,I Have Stayed In Much More Comfortable Rooms In Many Levels Of Hotel,,,,,,
,291,Not Really. But As Already Mentioned  Breakfast Service Was Not Up To The Rest Of The Hotel's High Standard,,,,,,
,296,The Room Was Lovely But Wasn't Expecting Not  To Be In The Main Hotel. The Food Exceeded Our Expectations.,,,,,,
,297,We Thought We Would Miss Tea Tray In Room But As It Was Only For One Night And We Had A Complimentary Tea In The Morning We Survived. At The Lords Of The Manor Where We Stay Often We Have Been Able To Request A Tray In Our Room.,,,,,,
,302,Had A Nicer Room!  Shown A Picture Of Your Dog Friendly Room On Your Web Site.  Unfortunately It Is Difficult For Us To Go Away Without Our Dog But We Are Obviously Still Choosy And Like Nice Rooms.  We Have Stayed In Some Lovely Ones Even With Henry So I Suppose It Is Expectations.,,,,,,
,305,Honestly  No.,,,,,,
,310,Slightly Wider Choice On The Menu For Dinner And More Food At The Breakfast Buffet.,,,,,,
,312,Shame The Gin Experience Wasn't Possible As Hadn't Booked.  Did Enjoy 4 Different Gins Between Us Though!,,,,,,
,315,A Bowl Of Muesli Was Missed Off Our Breakfast Order  We Rang Down To Infrom Reception And It Took Quite A While And A Further Phone Call Before It Arrived Meaning The Rest Of The Breakfast Had Gone Cold.  Also  The Room (Hawk Suite) Was A Bit Noisy In The Morning As The Door Opens Straight Out On To The Corrider.  A Lot Of The Noise I Think Was From Staff Having Conversations In The Hall At The Bottom Of The Stairs.,,,,,,
,316,The Parking Issue,,,,,,
,318,No,,,,,,
,320,Room Was Small But Well Appointed - No Complaints Here.  Dining Experience Could Have Been Much Better And That Coloured The Whole Experience Of Our Stay.  Would Be Happy To Stay At The Feathers Again But Are More Likely To Choose Another Hotel.,,,,,,
,326,Pre Dinner Drinks Arriving Pre Dinner. Two Of The Lovely Comfortable Armchairs In The Bedroom,,,,,,
,328,Noty That I Can Think Of - It Was Perfect,,,,,,
,329,Apart From Missold Information About The Evening Five Course Meal Which Sold On Pretext On Â£55 Not Â£45 As Stated On Day And As Already Purchased At Higher Price Left Me Feeling Dissatisfied  But Staff Friendly Room Lovely And Hotel Very Good.,,,,,,
,330,There Were Not Any Tea And Coffee Facilities In The Room  Which We Thought Was A Little Strange!  Swap The Jelly Beans For Chocolates?,,,,,,
,333,Not At All.,,,,,,
,335,No,,,,,,
,338,Improve Room 42  Sort Out The Parking  Provide Higher Quality Pillows And Duvet.,,,,,,
,340,Nothing I Can Think Of.  We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome.,,,,,,
,341,A Clean Room Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,,
,342,More Moisturiser Inroom,,,,,,
,343,More Moisturiser,,,,,,
,344,A Different Room Above Street Level! A Working Remote Control!,,,,,,
,345,Maybe Take The French Toast Off Your Breakfast Menu Or Add Sugar And Cinnamon To It (!?) - It Wasn't Quite What I Expected When It Arrived  I'm Not Sure It Would Have Been What Most People I Know Would Have Called French Toast.  It Was Well Presented And Well Made Though.,,,,,,
,347,Just The Heating In The Room.,,,,,,
,348,The Food At Dinner Let Us Down As Previously Mentioned But Otherwise Good,,,,,,
,349,Not Eeally,,,,,,
,357,To Keep Us Informed Of Any Ongoing Delays/Situations In The Service Area.,,,,,,
,360,Perhaps I Should Have Asked If It Was Possible To Change Our Room !  This Rather Coloured Our Opinion.,,,,,,
,361,We Were Not Informed Of Price Of Drinks As Went Along And Thought That Â£12 Was Rather A Lot For A Gin And Tonic,,,,,,
,362,The Room Was Extremely Noisy.  There Were Drinkers Outside The Pub Until 1Am And The Traffic Started To Roar Past At 6Am.  It Was Like Being In A Motorway Motel.,,,,,,
,364,Pressing,,,,,,
,366,The Bill Was Overcharged By Over Fifty Pounds? The Breakfast Was Good  But Coffee Needed Work. I Would Also Assume That A Full English Breakfast Included Toast!?,,,,,,
,371,No. Everything Was Lovely As Expected,,,,,,
,374,Have More Information About The History Of The Building.,,,,,,
,375,Final Account Was Wrong But Was Recified,,,,,,
,376,Mention Special Rates On Reservation  Considering Voucher Money In Your Account Since Last Aug 2012.,,,,,,
,377,Just A Better Room,,,,,,
,379,We Thought The Dinners Were Good But Certainly Not Exceptional.  We Would Have Liked Baked Beans With Breakfast.,,,,,,
,380,Staff Training Was The Issue With Dinner,,,,,,
,386,Yes - The Restaurant Dinner Menu Needs Simpler Choices And More Affordable Options (The Kings Arms Accross The Street Is A Better Option In My View),,,,,,
,394,Cold Night  Dining Room Could Have Been Warmer But Accept I Had A Silk Dress On !,,,,,,
,397,Provision For Earlier Breakfast As The Fair Starts Set Up At 7:30A.M I Was Unable To Have Breakfast On The Saturday,,,,,,
,400,A Bit Disappointed That Your Outside Smoking Shelter Was Not Heated As It Was A Very Cold Night And I Usually Enjoy A Cigar With Brandy After Dinner This Is Quite Common In London Scotts Etc.,,,,,,
,401,More Staff For Breakfast. Service And Food Was Slow,,,,,,
,403,Room  Hotel Itself And Food Were Very Good. Service Overall Was Disappointing.,,,,,,
,405,No,,,,,,
,407,Being Clearer About The Exclusion Of Vat In Advertised Prices.,,,,,,
,414,At Checkout Time  One Member Of Staff Was Checking People Out And Answering The Phone At The Same Time. I Waited About 15 Mins To Check Out.,,,,,,
,415,Training Amongst The Staff Who Appear To Be New. Redecoration Of The Restaurant  Particularly The Carpet.,,,,,,
,418,About 15 Minutes After We Left The Hotel We Discovered We Had Left A Mobile Phone On The Premises.  We Rang The Hotel Several Times But No One Answered  Re-Confirming Our Observation That The Hotel Is A Bit Under-Staffed.  When We Arrived Back We Searched For The Phone Ourselves And Found It In The Study.,,,,,,
,420,No  As A 10Th Anniversary It Was Great.,,,,,,
,425,Better Wi- Fi Access Necessary.,,,,,,
,426,Let Us Visit First.,,,,,,
,428,Been Given A Different Room.  I Wondered If We'd Been Given That Room Because We Were Using Secret Escapes.  The Hotel Wasnt Full When We Checked In Because Someone Came In While We Were Having Tea And Asked If They Could Book In Without A Reservation.  Acknowledgement Would Have Been Good - 40 Minutes Of Sitting In Study Before Being Asked If We Wanted Refreshments Depsite At Least 3 Staff Walking Past And Serving Others. Apology For Lack Of Tables For Breakfast / Tables Being Cleared Etc (Both Mornings) Maybe.  Any Interest At All Would Have Been Good.  Seriously Poor.,,,,,,
,430,Recommended 8 Pm Dining Not 830Pm As We Felt Too Late Towards The End Of Our Supper - Other Guest Left!,,,,,,
,441,No  I Don't Think So.....,,,,,,
,442,Personally  Being A Light Sleeper  To Have Tea / Coffee In Room Facilities Would Have Been A Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,443,By The Way - My Bill Was Not Correct On Leaving. You Had Added The Dinner On Top Of My Package But The Young Guy On Reception Apologised. It Just Tainted The Experience Really As It Showed A Lack Of Care / Communication.,,,,,,
,444,You Do Not Provide Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.  Fair Enough But You Must Make Sure That You Provide Them Promptly By Room Service When Asked - Waiting Over 25 Minutes For A Cup Of Tea (And Having To Phone To Remind You) Is Not Acceptable.,,,,,,
,445,More Than One Bar Of Soap - We Could Have Done With One For The Shower And One For The Hand Basin - A Small Point Though!!,,,,,,
,447,Maybe Gather Diners In In Closer Proximity When Not Many Bookings To Increase Buzz.,,,,,,
,450,I Really Would Have Liked A Kettle In The Room! I Understand Why You Don't Have Them And Tea Was Offered (But It Wasn't Clear Whether There Would Be A Charge And At The Prices Of All The Other Drinks That Would Have Made A Big Difference),,,,,,
,453,Tea/Coffee Making Facilities In Room; Making A Section Of The Bar Available To Guests Who Weren't Part Of The Wedding Party,,,,,,
,459,The Restaurant Experience Could Have Been A Lot Better And Is One Of The Worst I Have Had Ever Had As In The Head Waiter Didn't Smile Or Connect With Us Once.,,,,,,
,464,Speed Of Service. I Wouldn't Have Any Concern About Bringing A Smaller Party But Would Seriously Consider Before Bringing A Larger Partry Again.,,,,,,
,466,As Previously Mentioned  A Change Of Menu On The Second Night.,,,,,,
,467,We Did Enjoy Our Stay My Comments Are Things I Think You Can Easily Fix As I M Sure You Know These Small Things Make A Difference. Even On A Sunday Night.,,,,,,
,474,Better Wifi :),,,,,,
,475,The Breakfast Eggs Were Too Salty For All Our Tastes And We Found Them Inedible,,,,,,
,477,Your Staff Need To Get Lessons From Sven And Emily In Customer Services,,,,,,
,478,No,,,,,,
,481,Breakfast Needs Same Attention To Detail As The Main Dinner Service.,,,,,,
,487,We Anticipated The Room To Be Of A Higher Standard. Bath Plug Did Not Function Neither Did Telephone. Room Was Not Superior In Our Estimation But Nevertheless We Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,,
,488,Just Sharpen Up The Service At Dinner  I Think.,,,,,,
,493,No!!,,,,,,
,496,I Think My Restaurant Review Clearly States Where The Problems Arise,,,,,,
,500,Tea/Coffee Making Facilities  In The Room Would Have Been Nice.3 Drinks On Bill Which We Did Not Have But No Problem Once We Pointed It Out.,,,,,,
,501,It Was Only The Dining Which Spoilt Our Visit.    Other Than That We Thought The Feathers Was A Very Pleasant Hotel To Visit.,,,,,,
,506,Not From A Level Of Service No.,,,,,,
,512,See Previous Notes.,,,,,,
,516,The Fact That There Was A Problem In The Kitchen Was Handled Well My Fault I Chose To Eat At The Indian. Breakfast Was Terrible Bacon Like Shoe Leather Egg Overdone It Said Mushrooms On The Menu We Had Half A Mushroom Each,,,,,,
,518,No  Really Enjoyed Our Stay,,,,,,
,522,We Were Charged For Tickets Which Were Not Given To Us. We Ere Not Inforemd Of The Need To Reserve Dinner For Sat Night Well In Advance.,,,,,,
,524,I Feel Although The Website Is Very Enthusiastic About 'The Gin Experience'   When We Went To The Bar It Seemed Very Difficult To Actually Order A Drink. Staff Weren't Often There And When We Enquired About Selection Of  Gin Cocktails As Mentioned On The Website We Were Almost Discouraged. It Would Have Been Nice To Have Been Offered A Drinks Menu.,,,,,,
,526,Only The Addition Of Tea And Coffee Making Equipment  As Previously Mentioned.,,,,,,
,532,I Think A Really Big Problem For Us Was That There Were No Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room  I Know That We Could Ring Room Service And Get One Any Time However I Am A Very Early Riser And Was Dying For A Cuppa At 6.00 And Had To Wait Till Seven  I Know It Seems Small However Felt Like I Was Sitting Around Waiting,,,,,,
,543,Grapefruit Juice With Breakfast?,,,,,,
,549,No  We Had A Fantastic Stay And My Husband Thoroughly Enjoyed His Birthday Treat. We Shall Return!,,,,,,
,551,One Member Of The Party Was Ill And I Had To Cancel Early On The Day Of Arrival. I Accept And Understand That The Balance Had To Be Paid But Perhaps Given The Circumstances And The Fact That The Meal And Drinks Were Not Being Consumed For 8 People Only 7  This  Proportion Of The Cost Could Have Been Used To Provide Some Complimentary Drinks?,,,,,,
,553,No It Was Lovely.,,,,,,
,557,We Like Our Own Tea And Coffee In The Room  We Do Not Like Having Morning Tea Fetched To The Room.,,,,,,
,558,The Overall Stay Was Really Good And The Sun Shone For Us.  The Staff Were Helpful But Some Of The English Was Not Good.,,,,,,
,560,We Had To Wait About 10 Minutes To Be Served At The Gin Bar When We Returned From Our Evening Out. Noone Was At The Bar And We Had To Ask For Assistance At Reception Which We Thought Unacceptable In A Hotel Of Your Repute.,,,,,,
,561,No,,,,,,
,567,Removed The Previous Guests Soiled Clothing Before We Arrived In The Room.,,,,,,
,572,The Inacuracies With The Bill Were Disappointing And Hard To Follow With The Way The Bill Had Been Itemised For The Food Given We Had Agreed A Package Price. Some Items Were Charged Which We Had Not Consumed.,,,,,,
,576,We Received A Bottle Of Sloe Gin And Were Expecting A Bottle Of Hendricks.,,,,,,
,578,Breakfast Being Improved And The Bill Being Correct!,,,,,,
,582,I Did Not Appreciate The Service Charge Added To The Bill - Never Seen That At A Hotel Before And It Is An Unwelcome Innovation.,,,,,,
,585,Aforementioned Tea Making Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,588,The Breakfast Included In The B&B Rate Was A Little Sparse  But Of High Quality.,,,,,,
,595,Increase Your Staffing Levels.,,,,,,
,601,We Were In Room 25 Immediately Above Reception And Were Woken Soon After 6Am On Saturday Morning By Loud Voices Coming From Reception.  After About 10 Minutes Of Listening To This I Went Downstairs In My Dressing Gown To Complain  The Two Gentlemen Were Very Apologetic And It Was Peaceful After That.  It Was The Only Problem We Encountered During Our Stay.,,,,,,
,607,Stop Adding 'Discretionary' Service Charges To The Bill. If Guests Feel It Appropriate To Give An Additional Reward To Staff They Should Be Left To Make That Decision Themselves.,,,,,,
,613,No  Just The Heat In The Bedroom/Noise/Air Conditioning,,,,,,
,619,No,,,,,,
,621,No But I Am Not Sure Dining Experience This Time Quite Achieved. Offering Another Roll Rather Than Having To Ask... Slightly Bigger Portions Also Would Have Made Superb. Good Service,,,,,,
,623,Have Internet In The Rooms (Free),,,,,,
,629,We Felt That The Restaurant Was Overpriced.,,,,,,
,631,I Was Not Informed That The Restaurant Was Booked Out For A Function And Hence Could Not Eat There In The Evening. Hence I Did Not Even Think About Breakfast.,,,,,,
,633,A Little Disappointed In The Gin Bar  No Menu And The Barman Was Not That Engaged When Asked For Recommendations. Bit Puzzled As This Is One Of Your Key Items With So Many Gins.  Otherwise An Excellent Stay.,,,,,,
,635,No We Had A Lovely Stay.,,,,,,
,636,Get Back To A Level The Level Of Service And Excellent Food That You Used To Offer-As Recently As Our Previous Visit In February-Big Changes Have Occurred Since Then And The Feathers Is A Shadow Of It's Former Self.,,,,,,
,639,Your Staff Were Very Friendly And Hepful But Insome Cases Not Very Well Trained. Ordered A Cocktail  When It Came It Was Missing One Of The Ingredients.   When Raised The Matter We Wee Told They Had Run Out Of Peach Sauce  But Didnt Tell Us Up Front.,,,,,,
,651,No  Very Pleased Overall And Superb Value For Money.,,,,,,
,652,More Attentive In The Restaurant And Study,,,,,,
,654,Yes   If Someone Ask's If You Have A Disable Space   I Would Have Thought It Was Not A Good Idea To Put On The Third Floor With Stairs With No Handrail,,,,,,
,655,In The Restaurant One Of The Seats Facing The Window Means The Light From The Opposing Building Shiones In The Diners Eyes.,,,,,,
,656,Cleanliness Of Room Needs Addressing As Not Only Was Bedding Not Up To Standard But Towel Rail Was Dusty And Towels Were Not As Clean As Expected. Cannot Fault Staff During Our Stay Who Were Very Helpful,,,,,,
,668,Overall  The Hotel Is Very Nice. I Don't Think It Deserves The High Prices Demanded Of Everything Though. It Is Impossible To Sleep Well In Suite 1 Because Of The Floor Creaking And Having No Sleep Really Gives You A Bad Impression Of The Place. Staff Generally Very Nice.   ,,,,,,
,669,Overall A Good Experience But Sort The Main Courses At Dinner,,,,,,
,670,Fixed The Draught In The Bathroom!,,,,,,
,673,The Reception Staff  Though Extremely Helpful And Kind  Seemed Very Rushed Most Of The Time. There Could Be One Or Two More Staff There  If Possible. Even One More  As A Back Up  Would Be Good.,,,,,,
,675,Tea/ Coffee Making Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,677,Direction Of Staff,,,,,,
,680,Some Of Your Waiting Staff Seem Uncertain As To How To Serve Scones And Tea - I.E Not Sure How Many Scones There Will Be - Did Not Bring Plates To Put Them On - Did Not Bring Knives To Cut Them With And To Spread Cream And Jam,,,,,,
,683,The Wood Fires Are Lovely  But There Seems To Be A Great Deal Of Smoke In The Lounge Rooms. Are The Chimneys Working Correctly? It Made Me Cough Quite A Bit.,,,,,,
,684,Charged For A Bottle Of Wine We Did Not Have,,,,,,
,686,The Sommelier Could Have Been A Little More Informative.  We Love Wine And Would Have Liked To Talk More About The List And Go With Recommendations From The Sommelier. However  We Chose Some Really Good Wine And Were Happy With It.,,,,,,
,690,On Arrival Give A Quick Heads Up As To Where All The Facilities Are.,,,,,,
,703,Coffee And Biscuits In The Bedrooms.,,,,,,
,705,Felt The Drinks Prices Were A Little Steep And The Charge Of Â£4 For A Latte Was Ridiculous. Should Be Drink Facilities In The Room& Bath Robes.,,,,,,
,706,Do You Offer Chocolates Or Dipped Strawberries In The Room (As Extras?),,,,,,
,709,Deliver Iron Requested Without Chase. More Luxurious Rooms. Cleared Plates Away Promptly After Course Finished.,,,,,,
,710,Only Be Quicker With The Service. I Appreciate Enjoying My Evening At A Relaxed Pace When When I Ask For The Bill I Am Ready To Leave And Do Not Enjoy Sitting Trying To Catch The Waiters Attention To Ask Where The Bill Is. The Bill On Checkout Was Also Inaccurate And Although Quickly Sorted  Was Not Expected.,,,,,,
,711,Could Have Just Done A Little Better. See Comments Previously And The Lack Of Tea /Coffee Was A Real Niggle. Even The French Supply That Now. Chains At Â£19Pn Supply That. Gin Bar Was A Little Disappointing. Engagement With The Bar Man Was Mininimaal With No Rel Discussion  I Said What I Normally Drank Was Offered Three Run Of The Mill Alternatives No Offer To Taste And Felt It Was ' Well Order One'.,,,,,,
,720,It Is A Shame That Little Things Let You Down   Not Confirming Dinner On Arrival Not Having Bar Menu Not Having Bar Staff At All Times ,,,,,,
,723,Better Website Pictures To Reflect Bedrooms And Ranges Showercap As Part Of Basic Amenity,,,,,,
,724,No Caan't Think Of Anything,,,,,,
,734,Due To The Exceptionally Hot Weather The Room Was Very Hot As No Air Con ( Did Not Spoil Overall Experience),,,,,,
,735,Just Please Ensure Your Staff Are Trained  Informed And Able To Provide The Basics Like Check-In  Check-Out And At Table Service To The Highest Possible Standards.,,,,,,
,736,Stop The Refuse Collection Making So Much Noise Early Morning.,,,,,,
,742,No.,,,,,,
,743,I Think I Have Mentioned Them,,,,,,
,751,Staff Needs To Be More Welcomeing  And Appreciate Guests Needs,,,,,,
,753,The People Were Great  It Was Just The Room. We Had Stayed At Another (Cheaper) Hotel For The 2 Previous Nights  And That Room Was Much Nicer  So We Felt A Bit Shirt Changed.,,,,,,
,754,Not Really,,,,,,
,759,I'm Not In The Habit Of Complaining. I Realise Running This Hotel Requires A Lot Of Collaboration With Teams Of Staff. Maybe We Hit A Bad Weekend. It Can Happen. Good Luck For The Future.,,,,,,
,761,Wifi Throughout The Premises  Including All Of The Rooms ?,,,,,,
,762,No,,,,,,
,763,I Have Very High Standards Of The Feathers As Previous Stays Have Always Been Above And Beyond. It Is For This Reason Only That I Can Not Put 'Exceeded'. You Can Not Exceed The Perfection I've Come To Love About And Expect From Staying With You!,,,,,,
,766,Informed Us The Room Would Not Include A Bath. Provided A Bigger Quantity Of Food At Dinner Provided The Correct Food At Breakfast Clean The Room Throughly And Give A Comfy  Non Squeeky Bed!,,,,,,
,767,Better Timings In The Restaurant  But Still Had An Excellent Time,,,,,,
,768,The Evening Meal Was Very Good In Terms Of Presentation However The Portions Were Very Small ( Even For A Gourmet Tasting Menu) And The Flavour Was Lacking In One Or Two Of The Dishes- Just A Little Bland.,,,,,,
,771,So Much Good  But Given Price I Was Expecting A Greater Attention To Detail (Eg Smoking Fire  Bin Etc In Bedroom  Confusion Over Veggie Booking  Wait For Tea  Key With Number Sellotaped On).  'Nearly But Not Quite.' Sorry,,,,,,
,774,Our Room (28) Was Far Too Hot With 3 Radiators  Even With Windows Open And No Way Of Turning Them Down. Better Restaurant Experience ...More Attention To Detail As Advertised As Sister Hotel To Lords Of The Manor. Bar Lacks Atmosphere.,,,,,,
,782,Could Not Get Internet To Work And Staff Said This Was Usual,,,,,,
,786,Car Parking Would Be Helpful. On Street Parking Is Free But The Council Signs Do Not Say As Such. I Would Imagine This To Be A Big Issue In The Height Of The Season.,,,,,,
,788,I Was Really Pleased - My Husband And I Got A Welcoming  Peaceful Retreat For Our Wedding Anniversary.,,,,,,
,791,No. It Was Our Choice To Climb To The Room. ,,,,,,
,796,Find Some Parking!!,,,,,,
,797,As Said Earlier We Missed The Amazing Chef You Used To Have  Which Is The Reason We Had Re-Booked.,,,,,,
,801,No,,,,,,
,804,Nothing Whatsoever  A Great Experience,,,,,,
,805,Nothing Whatsoever,,,,,,
,806,Only By Putting Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Rooms.,,,,,,
,807,Parking Is Difficult,,,,,,
,815,I Thought The Bedroom Was Lovely And The Bathroom Well Appointed - And Great To Have The Wi Fi   I Have Put My Additional Comments Elsewhere In This Document,,,,,,
,817,The Bed Room Needs To Be Re-Furbished. Very Poor Quality. Ill Equipped. And The Counter Top In The Bathroom Was Not Cleaned Properly,,,,,,
,823,No,,,,,,
,829,More Ambience,,,,,,
,838,No Thank You.,,,,,,
,841,Have Quicker Room Service ,,,,,,
,844,I Ordered Some Tea One Afternoon - Biscuits Would Be Nice.  I First Stayed At The Feathers 30 Years Ago And Home Made Shortbread Was Always Served.  More Information In The Room Such As Breakfast Times Etc Would Be Helpful.,,,,,,
,846,Had To Ask You To Correct The Invoice - We Were Nearly Charged Twice - But All Done Without Fuss,,,,,,
,847,The Restaurant  As Previously Commented On And Punctuality Of Breakfast Room Service..,,,,,,
,848,No.,,,,,,
,852,Coffee And Tea In The Room,,,,,,
,854,The Dinner Menu Was Not Very Enticing. Signs On The Staircases Would Be Helpful  Got Lost And Tried All 3 … ,,,,,,
,857,Dining Room Staff Generally Less Engaged And Helpful Instructions Re Parking,,,,,,
,858,Slightly Sharper Service  Although Not In Your Face,,,,,,
,862,Accuracy Of Booking. We Were Charged The Full Amount At Checkout Even Though We Had Already Paid Great Escapes. We Were Charged For A Bottle Of Wine But Had Only Had 2 Glasses. Both These Were Rectified At Once,,,,,,
,863,Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,869,Honestly  It's Hard Too Thnk Of Anything. We Loved The Gin Bar And Tasting  And The The Christmas Gift Of Sloe Gin And The Beautiful Glasses Was Wonderful.  The Food Was Exceptional  Service Over The Top.  We Had Great Fun At The Pantomime And Thank You For The Tickets!,,,,,,
,870,I Thought The Service Charge Should Not Have Been On The Printed Bill  But At My Discretion. ,,,,,,
,876,All Mentioned Before. Also For Some Reason The Flannels Were Not Refreshed Despite Us Putting Them On The Bathroom Floor. Instead They Were Picked Off The Floor And Put On The Towel Radiator!!! We Requested Fresh Flannels And They Were Delivered Accordingly.,,,,,,
,887,You Need To Train Your Kitchen And Restaurant Staff Better....Service Was Good But Let Down By Poor Food And Incorrect Delivery Of Orders. ,,,,,,
,889,Our Complaint Was Dealt With Helpfully. 2 Gins We Could Not Have Had Appeared On Our Account. Again Dealt With Courteously.,,,,,,
,890,No,,,,,,
,891,Not Really,,,,,,
,892,No!,,,,,,
,894,We Don't Think So. Our Stay Really Was The Glittering Star On The Top Of Our Christmas Tree.,,,,,,
,895,Our Experience Was Probably Somewhere Between Met And Exceeds  Rather Than Just Met.  Just A Few Small Things That Have Let You Down  Including The Bill Being Incorrect On Check Out.,,,,,,
,896,No,,,,,,
,899,Sunshine (It Was Xmas When We Visited),,,,,,
,901,It Was Good!,,,,,,
,905,See Previous Comments. A Better Level Of Service And Communication Both Written And Verbal. You State You Are A Hotel But It Definitely Felt More Like A Pub Environment With Rooms. ,,,,,,
,909,As Before More Information About The Wines And The Gins Would Have Been Appreciated. ,,,,,,
,915,We Would Have Preferred To Have Dined With You  But That Was Beyond Your Control! ,,,,,,
,918,Wrong Newspaper Delivered In Morning  Bill Had Items On It We Had Not Ordered. It Would Be Nice To Have A Biscuit With Tea/Coffee Served In The Room,,,,,,
,925,See Earlier Comments.,,,,,,
,929,No - Not Really,,,,,,
,932,Whilst It Was Lovely To Have Log Burning Fires  I Found Them A Little Smokey!,,,,,,
,933,Service In The Bar And Restuarant Needs Improving,,,,,,
,938,No,,,,,,
,939,We Are Likely To Return But Felt That Our Recent Visit Wasn't Quite Up To The Standard Of Previous Visits.,,,,,,
,940,If A Guest Was Staying One Night You Could Offer To Match The Offer The Second Night,,,,,,
,941,Whilst Staff Were Happy To Deliver Tea/Coffee To Our Room  It Would Be Nice To Have Those Facilities In Your Room. We Also Understood We Could Have Tea In The Lounge But Were Charged For It But Not A Problem  Just Needs To Be Made Clearer.,,,,,,
,943,No,,,,,,
,944,No I Think You Have It Just Right  Well Done!,,,,,,
,947,Possibly More Guidance On Places To Visit,,,,,,
,949,Had Some Parking - Difficult In Woodstock I Know
Or Even A Valet Parking Service So That It Was Easier To Get Bags In To The Hotel. ,,,,,,
,958,Enhance The Wifi ,,,,,,
,964,I Refer To Comment Above,,,,,,
,965,Not To Have Run Out Of The 1724 Tonic Before I Had Chance To Try The Ultimate G&T.,,,,,,
,968,Shame You Can't Magic Up Car Parking!,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
