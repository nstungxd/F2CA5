,4,None,,,,,,
,5,We Did Enjoy The Feathers And Would Return But Would Probably Eat Out Next Time For Dinner.,,,,,,
,6,I Think It's Covered Under Dining Experience.,,,,,,
,10,On Arrival It Was Explained That There Are No Tea & Coffee Making Facilities Within The Room But That We Could Request Them At Any Time And They Would Be Brought Into The Room. There Was No Mention That A Fee Would Be Payable And When The Bill Was Provided At Checkout There Were Additional Costs Of Â£15.00 For Drinks Which We Thought Should Have Been Complimentary.,,,,,,
,12,I Did You A Review Ln Trip Advisor And Had Confirmation But Cannot Find It.,,,,,,
,14,Improved Wifi Signal In Rooms Could Be A Great Plus,,,,,,
,18,Computer Glitch With The Account That Was Tactfully And Pleasantly Dealt With By The Check Out Receptionist,,,,,,
,23,Loovly Place,,,,,,
,28,As A Family We Have Used The Feathers For 3 Events  1 Went Well The Latest 2 Fell Short Of Expectation. The Feathers Needs To Provide A More Coherent And Professional Service To Its Customers To Warrant The Prices Being Charged.,,,,,,
,37,Thought Room A Bit Overpriced. We Had It On A Good Rate From Booking.Com But Even So I Thought It A Little Overpriced,,,,,,
,41,Gin Bar Far Too Expensive,,,,,,
,42,After Leaving You I Went Elsewhere For A Couple Of Days. It Was Irritating  Upon Getting Home  To Find Two Emails Asking For This Survey To Be Completed. I Wouldn't Really Describe It As 'Short'  Either.,,,,,,
,43,Very Good Impression Of The Feathers And Would Recommend It To Acquaintances.,,,,,,
,45,We'll Be Back. The Â£60 Allowance For Dinner Was An Excellent Marketing Idea. Made Value For Money Great. Breakfast Was A Pleasure. Didn't Eat For The Rest Of The Day.,,,,,,
,46,It Was Disappointing On Checking Out To Find A 99 Pound Entry That Was Not Applicable.  This Was Quickly Rectified But Had The Effect Of Distracting Us From The 22 Pound Charge For Risotto That Was Listed On The Menu As 14 Pounds And A 4 Pound Entry For A Pinot Which We Did Not Have.   It Would Appear Reasonable To Suggest That The Account Section Of Your Orgnization Needs To Improve.,,,,,,
,50,Small Rooms Need Some Furniture Taking Out So There Is More Room To Walk Round The Room.,,,,,,
,51,I Am Unsure Of The Room Number But We Stayed One Night On The 8Th May. Mr & Mrs Cole. Email Address Sm.Cole@Hotmail.Co.Uk.,,,,,,
,54,Most Important Aspect I Believe Is To Ensure A Warm Greeting On Arrival - Which We Didn't Get After An Almost 2 Hour Drive To Get There.,,,,,,
,56,We Shall Definitely Return.,,,,,,
,68,Thank You For A Very Memorable And Relaxing Stay At The Feathers. We Will Definitely Be Returning In The Future And Look Forward To Seeing You Again.,,,,,,
,69,Such A Shame That There Were A Few Little Grievances As Otherwise It Was Really Excellent!,,,,,,
,70,Just A Personal Thank You For Eventually Finding My Raincoat That I Inadvertantly Left In The Wardrobe - Much Appreciated; Thank You Emily For Perservering In Tracking It Down!,,,,,,
,72,Afternoon Tea Was Very Nice  Too Much Slate Used In The Restaurant,,,,,,
,73,A Truly Lovely Experience And Chance To Catch Up With Old Friends. Thank-You So Much  Keep Up The Excellent Work.,,,,,,
,74,In Q19 I Have Answered Honestly - There Was An Error On The Account; However  It Was Corrected Efficiently  Courteously And With Full Apology.,,,,,,
,78,My Stay At The  Feathers Was My First Night In The Cotswolds And Was A Perfect Start To My Trip. Woodstock Is A Charming Town And I Will Make Sure That I Return.,,,,,,
,80,No  All Was Good Thank You,,,,,,
,81,What A Disappointment....Hotel Is Lovely But Food Totally Failed To Match It. All Seemed Lacking A Good Manager.,,,,,,
,82,We Came On A Travelzoo Deal And Felt That Even This Was Not Value For Money. All Said  We Did Enjoy Our Stay But You Did Ask For An Honest Opinion And Therefore We Have Provided You With Our Comments For Your Perusal.,,,,,,
,85,The Hotel Is Charming  An Eclectic Mix Of Interesting Styles. The Service Was Disjointed  A General Feeling Of Lack Of Cohesion. A Fire In The Study Would Have Made The Sumptuous Tea A Truly Memorable Experience.,,,,,,
,86,I Shall Watch Trip Advisor With Interest.  If Your Staffing Levels Improve We Should Be Delighted To Return  As The Food Is Simply Stunning - Especially The Gin-Tasting Menu.,,,,,,
,92,One Of Our Best Ever Weekends.  Thank You.,,,,,,
,93,The Only Other Negative Comment Is That We Were Woken Up Very Early  And Very Loudly  By Room Service Being Delivered To Two Of The Neighbouring Rooms!  This Could Be Done A Lot More Quietly And Discreetly. Overall Though  We Loved The Feathers And Particularly Bleneim  And We Would Like To Come Back At Some Point With Our Little Boy.,,,,,,
,96,We Stayed For Our Wedding Anniversary And Because Of This I Ordered A Bottle Of Champagne For The Room. This Was Not Provided So I Ordered One Through Room Service. On Check Out I Was Charged For Two Bottles Of Champagne!!!  I Had To Point Out This Mistake. I Feel Overall That Our Experience Was Not Good Value For Money,,,,,,
,98,We Are Looking Forward To Our Next Stay!,,,,,,
,104,I Liked The Sitting Area Where One Could Read Or Use The Internet. An Attractive And Quiet Area.,,,,,,
,106,I Think That Guests Should Be Warned Of This Type Of Event.  It Has A Major Impact On A Stay In Woodstock & At The Feathers.  We'd Been Trying To Plan A Visit For Ages And It Spoiled The Overall Experience For Us.  We Would Not Have Visited At This Time If We Had Known What Was In Store.,,,,,,
,110,It Was Many Years Since We Had Stayed And The Hotel Has Changed A Lot. It Was Our Fault For Not Checking The Website First. However Despite The Changes The Bed Was Very Uncomfortable And Sadly We Are Unlikely To Return,,,,,,
,111,Wonderful Hotel,,,,,,
,113,Kettle In Room,,,,,,
,120,We Would Not Have Stayed With You Without The Travelzoo Offer As We Are Retired And On A Limited Budget.,,,,,,
,121,I Would Like To Think That  If We Come Again  We Would Be Given A Room On A Lower Floor!,,,,,,
,122,We Loved The Quirks And Old Charm Of The Hotel And Our Room At The Top Was Lovely.  But A Better Level Of Service Would Have Seen Us Give This Stay Top Marks.,,,,,,
,124,Stayed 2 Nights And Sheets Not Changed And Even Bath Towels Just Folded Up And Put Back On Towel Rail!  Expect More In This Class Of Hotel,,,,,,
,125,I Would Like To See More Informal Seating In The Gin Bar.  I Thought The Tables And Chairs Too Formal For A Relaxing Drink. Mr Carpenter Would Like To See Tea And Coffee Facilities In The Room.,,,,,,
,126,I Have Stayed Many Times At The Feathers. This Was The Worst Stay By Some Margin And Was Poor Enough To Consider Whether I Would Come Back Or Try Out Somewhere Else In Oxford. What A Shame.,,,,,,
,127,The Girl Working In The Gin Bar Was Really Pleasant And Friendly And Made Every Effort To Please And Explain About The Different Gins.,,,,,,
,130,We Had A Little Problem With The Reservation And The Food But The Hotel Manager Was Very Good With It  Very Profesional!!!!! We Left The Hotel Happy. Thank You For That.,,,,,,
,133,Account Was Wrong Because Of The Chimney Fire And Everyone Was Very Pushed! Very Easily And Quickly Rectified By Yourselves Who Spotted The Mistake!! Thank You,,,,,,
,136,Overall I Was Very Impressed With The Food Gin Bar And Service. I Just Found The Room (I Think It Was Suite 2) A Bit Bland  Although I Had Stayed In A Cinema Suite At The Hotel Du Vin Cambridge On The Previous Night Which Was Amazing (May Have Set The Bar Very High). My Girlfriend Had Stayed At The Hotel Previously And Said It Was A Vast Improvement.,,,,,,
,139,Complimentary Morning Coffees For Residents Is A Great Idea - Especially As They Are Not Just Normal Coffee But From The Espresso Machine. Its Little Touches Like This That Make The Difference And Set You Apart From Other Hotels. Not Sure If We Like The Discretionary Service Charge On The Hotel Bill - Never Come Across This In Any Other Hotel We've Stayed At. We Like To Leave Personal Gratuities Where Deserved.,,,,,,
,143,I Did Have A Very Enjoyable Birthday Celebration At Your Hotel.,,,,,,
,144,Room Service Was Prompt And Efficient.,,,,,,
,147,Love The Hotel But Was Lacking A Little In Ambiance This Time Round. We Decided That Background Music Would Have Been An Advantage In The Dining Room Because  Even Although There Were Several Couples Having Breakfast The Room Was So Quiet And Everyone Was Whispering Self Consciously.,,,,,,
,149,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay  The Food And Service Was Fantastic And The Room Luxurious And Clean. It Was Good Value On The Offer We Booked Through And Located Very Conveniently For Bicester Shopping!,,,,,,
,152,Wonderful Stay And Would Be Even More Wonderful If I Could Have The Cauliflower Soup Recipe Asap Due To The Length Of Time I Have Left To Live Sadly.,,,,,,
,154,A Really Good/Exceptional Experience Just Blighted By One Key Failing.,,,,,,
,155,Thank You For Making Our Anniversary Night So Special!,,,,,,
,162,The Gin Bar Was Great And Knowledge Was Very Good,,,,,,
,164,Its All In Email!!!,,,,,,
,166,Perhaps Your Website Could Say That Parking Is Free Outside The Hotel  But I Suppose It Was A Nice Surprise To Find The Parking Restrictions Were Not Enforced.,,,,,,
,170,We Felt We Only Had To Option To Do The Taster Menu  No One Advised If We Could Change And Pay The Difference.  Upon Finding That The Taster Menu Was Not To Our Satisfaction  The Taster Was Exactly That And Not All Of The Small Courses Were Liked.  At This Stage We Would Of Decided To Stop The Taster Menu And Order A Further Meal From Another Menu As Eating So Little And Not Liking Each Course Left Us Deflated And Slightly Hungry.  Special Courses Were Catered For With The Lacto Intolerant Person  But Again No Choice To Opt Out If Not Liked.,,,,,,
,171,Our Day Was Perfect And We Felt That The Staff Went Above And Beyond Their Duties.  Eg The Champagne Brought To The Church And The Pumpkin Carving For The Children.  Brilliant Service Throughout.,,,,,,
,179,Thank You For Making Our Stay Any Partners Birthday Special,,,,,,
,186,We Think The Value And Quality Of Dining Experience Was Strong. The Accommodation Was A Little Pricey. Also Surprised That When We Checked On Your Website There Was No Rooms Showing As Available When We Could Find A Feature Room On Laterooms.,,,,,,
,187,We Enjoyed The Celebration In Spite Of The Fire And Were Looked After. We Hope We Can Return Sometime And Experience The Courtyard Also.,,,,,,
,188,I Was Also Very Unhappy That The Wine Cellar Keys Were Not Available As A Member Of Staff Had Taken Them Home (!) And I Could Not Have The Wine I Ordered With Dinner. I Had Made Sure That You Stocked Good Wines When I Made The Booking As This Is Equally As Important To Me When Dining  But I Was Hugely Disappointed And Ended Up With A Mediocre Glass Of Rioja. However  The Manager Was Very Apologetic  But This Does Not Detract From It Spoiling My Experience In Your Restaurant. On A Positive Point  I Felt That The Breakfast Manager Was Excellent And I Hugely Enjoyed This Dining Experience More Than Dinner - Which Is A First For Me!!!,,,,,,
,190,A Superb Mini Break And With The Offer We Were On ( Meals And Tickets To Blenheim Palace) Which Was Excellent Value For Money. Have Recommended Already To Friends And Family And Now Looking For Our Next Place Of Interest To Go To.,,,,,,
,198,We Really Enjoyed Our Stay With You And Stay In Hotels Very Regularly  Would Definitely Return And Would Recommend  It Was Also Great Value. Many Thanks,,,,,,
,202,This Is Way More Than You'd Normally Get In A Survey Out Of Me...,,,,,,
,208,Have Stayed At The Feathers Often  In Fact Spending One Christmas With Our Family But This Time Did Not Feel It Had Quite The Same Old World Charm,,,,,,
,213,We Would Love To Return At Some Point If Better Overall Experience Was Guaranteed :-),,,,,,
,214,Given An Incorrect Bill.  After Card Experience  Not Impressed.,,,,,,
,215,I Would Love To Return . Please Keep Me Informed Of Offers,,,,,,
,216,Thought The Newspaper Style Room Guide Was A Great Idea And Enjoyed Reading About The History Of The Hotel. Although We Arrived Before Our Room Was Ready  Staff Were More Than Happy To Look After Our Bags. Parking Was A Bit Tricky  But Staff Were Helpful In Telling Us That The Restriction Notices No Longer Applied. We Had A Thoroughly Enjoyable Stay.,,,,,,
,217,Great Hotel  Would Stay Again - Just A Few Minor Hiccups - Without Those It Would Have Been Perfect And For The Price It Should Be Perfect.,,,,,,
,222,Overall A Very Pleasant Experience. Thank You,,,,,,
,225,Good Luck And We Shall Come Back One Day.,,,,,,
,229,Although The Final Account Was Inaccurate  Staff Were Professional And Efficient In Correcting The Error.,,,,,,
,230,It Met Our Expectations Because We Have Stayed Here Before  We Think The Hotel Is Excellent And When It Is Excellent Again It 'Meets Our Expectations'. Do Not Take It As A Negative.,,,,,,
,231,Great Welcome Even With Our Dog - Definitely Dog Friendly (Not Just Dog Tolerant !) Loved It,,,,,,
,233,If You Have Any Offers In The Future Please Contact! We Would Love To Come Again  One Night Stay Was Not Enough...,,,,,,
,235,We Both Agreed That We Would Definitely Stay Again.  I Have Also Put A Review On Tripadvisor.,,,,,,
,236,Greeting Was Very Good And Then The Room Was A Disappointment. For A Hotel Of A 4 Star Rating This Was Poor.  Had We Booked A Longer Stay We Would Have Asked For A Change Of Room.  I Understand We Took This On A Travelzoo Voucher But This Should Not Have Made A Difference.,,,,,,
,239,We Enjoyed Our Stay But Please See Comments On Dining And Room Facilities. I Would Have Been Very Disappointed Had I Paid Full Price.,,,,,,
,242,I Am Grateful That You Found A Room For Me At Fairly Short Notice  And That On Arrival My Wife And I Were Welcomed And Very Courteously Treated. We Were Sorry Not To Have The Opportunity Of Dining In Your Hotel : We Had Dined Earlier  With Friends Nearby.,,,,,,
,244,Lovely Stay - Thank You.,,,,,,
,249,We Will Stay Again And Recommend Your Hotel.,,,,,,
,253,Your Staff Are Helpful  Or As Helpful As They Can Be. And You Do Have A Delightful Hotel.,,,,,,
,257,Drink Prices At The Bar Were A Bit Top-Heavy.,,,,,,
,259,We Had A Lovely Time And Much Appreciated The Surprise Upgrade To Our Room. When We Went Out For A Drink After Dinner (In The Rain/Snow) The Receptionist Gave Us An Umbrella Which Was Very Kind!,,,,,,
,266,The Room Was Not Good Value For Money - I.E. It Was Over-Priced. While The Setting Was Pleasant  The Food In The Restaurant Was Over-Priced And Was Often Disappointing. For Example  The Tuna At Lunch Was A Ver Small Portion And Did Not Have Much Flavour.,,,,,,
,268,Thank You All For A Lovely Break. Will Definitely Return And Recommend.,,,,,,
,270,I Think We Have Said Enough!,,,,,,
,271,We Didnt Pay The Service Charge - The Service Was Ok But We Felt Did Not Warrant The Charge. I Do Object To It Being Added Automatically To The Bill. If Asked If We Want To Pay Something We Would Have Made A Gesture.,,,,,,
,277,Music In The Restaurant Is Also Rather Mundane.,,,,,,
,278,Please Pass On Our Complements To The Chef And Ben As The Food Was Outstanding And Ben Was Superb,,,,,,
,283,My Only Observation Was That We Did Have To Wait 5-10 Min On 2 Occasions For Service .Firstly At The Bar Just After Arrival To The Point We Were Unsure It Was Open Or Not .Eventually A Member Of Staff Did Turn Up But Was Not Very Knowledgeable Of The Products Behind The Bar And So I Was Quite Dissapointed I Couldn't Try One Of The Gin Combinations Mentioned In The Brochure And Also My Husband Was Served An Entirely Different Drink Than He'd Asked For So We Had To Return To The Bar To Request The Correct Drink. The Second Time Was On Departure And Myself And A Number Of Other Guests Were Left Waiting Again For 5/10 Min Before A Staff Member Appeared.,,,,,,
,286,Thank You For A Lovely Stay And We Will Return For Another Experience.,,,,,,
,289,We Had Booked Dinner For Four But  In The Event  We Were Joined By Two More.  The Staff Were Most Obliging In Accommodating The Additional Booking And Setting A Table For Six In The Bar Area.  Also  A Non Meat Eating Member Had A Suitable Substitution For The Meat Course.  Many Thanks For This Individual Level Of Service,,,,,,
,291,No,,,,,,
,293,There Were Some Nice Touches  For Example  The Vast Knowledge Of The Gin Bar Waiter; And Having The Bill Ready For When I Came To Check Out.,,,,,,
,302,Food Was Great,,,,,,
,305,These Days We Do Not Often Visit The Cotswolds Having Been Many Times Before. There Is Usually A Reason And This Time We Wanted To Spend A Day At Blenheim Palace. We Could Not Have Chosen A Better Place To Stay.,,,,,,
,312,Would Have Preferred Tea / Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.  Having Stayed At Other Luxury Hotels Where This Has Been Discreetly Placed Inside Large Drawers We Know This Is Possible.  Alternatively Offering A Tea Delivery For Early Morning Would Have Been Wonderful.,,,,,,
,315,Staff Were Extrememly Friendly And Helpful  Lovely Place And Great Restaurant.  Only Two Minor Gripes Above Prevented It From Being Absolutely Perfect.....,,,,,,
,316,Thank You Again For All That We Experienced At The Feathers Making The Weekend A Very Special Occasion.,,,,,,
,317,Q19. Minor Point. The Water We Had With Dinner Hadnt Been Added To The Bill But Was Quickly Amended At Reception,,,,,,
,318,No,,,,,,
,319,I Would Word It 'Sad To Leave'... But  We Could Have Stayed Much Longer.... When Checking Our Bill At Home We Noticed It Was Accurate. We Do Hope That The Service Was Included As There Was No Specification Of It In Our Bill. Please  Let Us Know Otherwise And We Will Be Very Happy To Say Thanks In A Few Notes.   We Look Forward To Seeing You Soon. Thank You Again.  Mr And Mrs Harvey.,,,,,,
,328,Please Don;T Change A Thing - We'll Be Back!!,,,,,,
,330,It Was A Little Chilly In The Dining Room..But We Closed The Window,,,,,,
,331,I Feel The Mistake At Breakfast Was Made Because Of A Lack Of Communication Amongst The Serving Staff,,,,,,
,333,Thank You To The Whole Team For Making Our Visit Pleasurable.,,,,,,
,335,No,,,,,,
,338,No,,,,,,
,340,See You Again Soon  I Hope,,,,,,
,341,I Think It Is Such A Shame That Housekeeping Let You Down.  The Room Was Lovely.   I Think Service Overall Appears To Be Slightly Disjointed.   Also   It Would Have Been Nice To See The Manager At Some Point Given The Issues We Had Had   Although To Be Fair He Did Call And May Not Have Been On Site.,,,,,,
,343,Fantastic,,,,,,
,349,Was Not Aware We Had To Book The Gin Tasting  So We Missed Out On That.  However The Waiter Recommended Us A Couple Of Good Gins.,,,,,,
,350,We Have Stayed In Hotels All Over The World And We Would Rate The Feathers At The Top Of The List. We Were Very Impressed With The Whole Stay  From The Moment We Entered The Hotel To The Moment We Left. We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome By All Staff  Who Could Not Do Enough To Assist Us. We Will Definitely Return With Friends Later This Year.,,,,,,
,352,We Will Not Dine With You Again If We Stay,,,,,,
,354,Great To Have Free Wi-Fi.  The Gin Bar Was Superb And The Outside Seating Area Lovely In The Sunshine,,,,,,
,357,Otherwise My Wife And I Enjoyed Our Stay At Your Hotel.,,,,,,
,360,I Still Cannot Understand Why A Service Charge Was Added To Our Account (Only Noticed Afterwards) - It Is Not At All Obvious To What It Applies Ie It Does Not Appear To Be 10% Of Anything.,,,,,,
,361,Overall A Very Pleasant Experience,,,,,,
,371,We Have Stayed On Previous Occasions. Once In A Suite Which Was A Real Treat. We Will Stay Again As Soon As We Can,,,,,,
,376,Apart From Above All Ok,,,,,,
,380,Please Don't Take My Negative Comments To Represent A Bad Time. We Ate Drank And Took Everything In Our Stride. We Had A Nice Time,,,,,,
,382,Lovely Hotel The Gin Tasting Was Excellent And Was Well Explained By The Bar Manager,,,,,,
,384,At Breakfast On !St Morning Milk In Jug Was Sour,,,,,,
,385,The Chairs In Dining Room Also Very Comfortable. Nice Ambience And Liked The Feathers Carpet. Would Be Integrated In Knowing Who Manufactured It.,,,,,,
,386,We Travelled In From California And Jet Lag Made Getting Up In The Morning A Bit Challenging. My Son Was About 5 Mins Late To Breakfast And Was Refused Service. That Was Disappointing To Me.,,,,,,
,387,Very Nice Hotel  I Would Just Question The Value Proposition. I Thought The Price Was High For The Facilities Available. Thic Would Make Me Hesitate Next Time.,,,,,,
,390,All Lovely . Thankyou,,,,,,
,391,Look Forward To Staying With You Again Very Soon!,,,,,,
,392,Pleasant Stay With Great Gin Collection!,,,,,,
,401,Overall Excellent,,,,,,
,404,Thank You For This Survey But So Far All I Have Done Is Booked The Trip  I Haven't Actuall Stayed Yet!,,,,,,
,405,Did Not Anticipate The Parking Problems.,,,,,,
,414,No,,,,,,
,415,I Have Detailed Both Positive And Negative Comments Only Because We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay Yet Felt Some Fine Tuning Is Required. Hope You Remain A Warm And Inviting Place Whilst Continuously Improving The Service And Some Of The Dated Facilities.,,,,,,
,417,A Very Pleasant Stay All Round And Good Value For Money.,,,,,,
,418,No,,,,,,
,426,Why Did You Send This Questionnaire?,,,,,,
,427,Lovely Stay.,,,,,,
,428,We Hadnt Read Trip Advisor Before Booking This Break Through Secret Escapes Because I Knew Of The Hotel's Repution.  Given Other Reviews For The Weekend Previous To Ours  I Wonder If The Teams Of Staff Work Every Other One... As I Said Pre Arrival Communications Were Great -Emily I Think - But From The Point Of Being Shown Our Room  Which Was Along The Street  With The Staircase Leading To At Least Two Rooms Above Us Running Along The Bed Head Wall  It Went Downhill Rapidly! The Receptionist Didn't Offer Any Information On The Hotel Other Than Give Us The Hotel Information Which Is A Printed Leaflet (Different From The Usual Folder In Yr Room.) No Offer Of Newspapers  Direction Of The Lounge Area Etc. The Bedroom Itself Was Fine  The Bathroom Lovely. However The Customer Service Is Appalling. When We Did Get The Refreshments Mentioned Before  The  Afternoon Tea Included In Our Package  Was Very Nice. We Turned Up For Breakfast At Approx 9.45Am (10.30 Closing) On Saturday Having Been Woken By What We Assume Were Staff Delivering The Papers And Then Room Service From Approx 7.30Am To The Rooms Upstairs- Front Door Banged  Travelling Up The Stairs  Down The Stairs  Door Banged Again - Get The Picture? Arriving Back In Reception I Asked The Receptionist If We Should Wait To Be Seated Or Just Go In To The Restaurant For Breakfastband Was Totally Ignored. He Continued Looking At His Pc! We Went In To Find A Distinct Lack Of Cleared Tables And Not A Staff Member To Be Seen. 5 Minutes Or So Later Staff Returned And Began To Clear The Tables And Laid One For Us. Not A Friendly Face In Sight Sadly. No Cereal Bowls At The Buffet Table. However Breakfast Was Indeed Delicious With Good Choices On The Menu. Fruit Juices Was Lovely Too. Toast Was Decidly Weird - Appeared To Be Warmed Ciabatta. We Returned For Supper In The Hotel. Service Was Fine  Staff In Fact Very Nice And The Food Was Superb. Good Choice Of Wines.  Bar Man Very Friendly.  Returning To Our Room  We Were Grateful That The Guests Above Retired At Around The Same Time As Us Saving Us From The Disruption We'd Encountered The Night (& Morning) Before. Breakfast On Sunday Was Much The Same - No Clean Tables Available  No Offer Of Juices (Though Did Arrive After Request) No Bowls. Food Took Much Longer As Well And Despite Making The Same Order  The Content Was Different. We Weren't The Last In So Others Would Have Received Similar Service To Us. It Also Took 15 Minutes At Least To Check Out Due To A Lack Of Staff. When Asked If We'd Enjoyed Our Stay  Our Response Was 'No  Not Really' To Which The Staff Response Was 'Oh'.  Real Shame Because We Really Needed This Break Away.  ,,,,,,
,429,Made Them Already,,,,,,
,430,Gin Bar Prices Are A Little Excessive - Difficult Not To Feel A Little Fleeced. W Ewill Be Back And We Will Recommend/ Have Recommended Others - You Have A Special Venue - More Offers Like The One We Used And We Will Take It Up!,,,,,,
,432,No Thankyou,,,,,,
,438,Staff Were Very Helpful With Giving Us And Heating Up Milk For Our Toddler,,,,,,
,440,The Only Slip Up Was That We Ordered A Bottle Of Wine To Be In Our Room On Arrival As It Was My Husband's Birthday  And It Wasn't There!  It Got To Us Eventually But It Spoilt The Surprise.,,,,,,
,441,Can't Wait To Stay Again....Chester The Dog Enjoyed Himself Also,,,,,,
,442,Overall  A Great Stay  Excellent Setting And Service. Already Passed Recommendation To Friends And Will Endeavour To Return In The Not Too Distant Future. Thank You To All Staff  A Wonderful  Trouble Free Experience  Hard To Match But Hopefully Easily Maintained.,,,,,,
,443,Staff Are Key. You Have A Lovely Little Hotel But It Could Be Really Good If People Were Proud Of Where They Worked And Really Paid Attention To The Customers.,,,,,,
,444,Despite Minor Gripes Above I Thought The Feathers A Fine Establishment And Really Enjoyed Our Stay - We Have Already Recommended You To Friends And Would Be Happy To Return.,,,,,,
,445,Sharing A Pot Of Tea On The Terrace Was A Simple Pleasure!!,,,,,,
,451,The Stairs To Suite 1 Are Very Steep!,,,,,,
,455,Overall Value For Money And Standards Need Addressing,,,,,,
,459,We Did Tell Reception Of Our Experience,,,,,,
,464,I Would Emphasise That The Food And Service Was Excellent But That The Time Between Courses Was A Little Too Long (Even After Pre-Ordering) Which Meant That Personally  I Couldn't Completely Relax And Enjoy The Experience Fully.,,,,,,
,466,No.,,,,,,
,474,Very Pleasant Stay.  Great Gin And Tonic!,,,,,,
,476,We Wish That Circumstances Had Permitted Us To Try Some Of The Gins,,,,,,
,478,No,,,,,,
,486,There Was A Mix-Up With The Bill When We Left. Our Restaurant Bill Included Â£140 Worth Of Drinks That We Didn't Have! It Was Sorted Out Smoothly And Quickly However.,,,,,,
,489,Having Just Moved To Bladon We Will Probably Not Be Staying So Much In The Future But Will Be Very Happy To Recommend You To Friends And Visitors And We Will Dine With You Again.,,,,,,
,492,Looking Forward To A Further Stay With My Sister And Her Husband For A Special Anniversary At The End Of July,,,,,,
,493,Yes....These Will Be Added To Trip-Advisor  This Is The Least That I Can Do To Show Our Appreciation,,,,,,
,495,Apologies For Taking The Key!,,,,,,
,500,Enjoyed Our Stay Staff Lovely. Drinks Expensive!,,,,,,
,502,A Superb Hotel Which I Recommend Regularly To Friends And Colleagues.,,,,,,
,503,I Am A Regular Visitor To The Feathers  Often Travelling Alone For Business. However On This Occasion Came With Friends.  As Ever The Service And Hospitality Was Impeccable. Many Thanks,,,,,,
,506,Just Check Your Afternoon Tea Goods As Our Scones Were Very Dry. Wasn't A Major Problem But Some People Do Like Complaining!!,,,,,,
,507,Final Account Had Extra Bottle Of Wine Charged But Sorted Quickly And Courteously By Staff,,,,,,
,511,Quality And Standard Was Good Shame About The Hair In Bath   Bath Robe And Breakfast,,,,,,
,512,Oh  There Seemed To Be A Lack Of Ice Saturday Night Which Was A Bit Strange For A Gin Bar. We Had A Nice Stay But I'd Like To See A Few Improvements Before I Book Again.,,,,,,
,516,Wasn't Able To Pay My Bar Bill As The System Was Down. I Presume It Has Been Charged To My Credit Card. Still Haven't Received Copy By Email As Requested. Over All For A Â£200 Night Stay Didn't Think It Was Value For Money. If It Hadn't Of Been For Peter The Manager  Could Have Been A Whole Lot Worse. Nice Hotel  Nice Village. Don't Waste It,,,,,,
,518,I Found The Hotel On Secret Escapes A Couple Of Weeks Ago And As We Celebrated Our 30Th Wedding Anniversary On The 15/10 We Felt It Was Felt It Was Fate As We Stayed At The Feathers For The First Night Of Our Honeymoon!  Obviously  The Hotel Has Changed Significantly Since Then And Very Much For The Better.  If We Were To Visit The Area We Would Stay There Again.,,,,,,
,523,We Paid Â£149.00 For Dinner Bed And Breakfast And Thought It Exceptional Value.  When The Staff Found Out It Was Our Wedding Anniversary They Gave Us A Glass Of Champagne To Celebrate - A Very Nice Touch.  Thank You For Making It A Special Occasion.,,,,,,
,526,We Will Choose Not To Come At The Same Time As Grand Prix Dates  As The Room Costs Were Extremely High.  We Did Love Suite 2 However - Comfortable  Dark And Cosy.  We May Return For 2/3 Days In Late August When En Route From Scotland To France.  Thank You.,,,,,,
,529,Discretionary Service Charge On The Bill Is A Weird Tension That Most Guests Will Not Want To Deal With. Should Be All Inclusive Price,,,,,,
,530,It Was Our First Visit To The Gin Bar - A Great Addition!,,,,,,
,531,I Loved The Weather Report At Breakfast- Nice Touch. We Appreciated Buying Tickets For Blenheim Palace From You  But For Some Reason They Were Not Added To The Bill. As Christians  We Were Keen To Be Honest So Popped Back To Pay The Extra When We Realised. The Receptionist Was Lovely  And Sorted Quickly. Not A Big Issue At All; We Had A Fabulous Week-End To Remember  With Very Helpful Staff. Thank-You!,,,,,,
,545,Enjoyed The Free Morning Coffee Offered After Our Walk Around The Village...Nice Touch,,,,,,
,549,Peter  We Hope Your Wedding In Germany Is A Wonderful Experience And A Very Happy Day!,,,,,,
,551,Thank You To All Staff Who Made Our Stay So Fantastic And Gave My Sister A Birthday To Remember.,,,,,,
,553,A Memorable Stay Once Again. We Will Of Course Return. A Lovely Hotel In A Beautiful Village  So Easy For Exploring The Cotswolds.,,,,,,
,554,While We Stayed At The Feathers We Celebrated Our 40Th Wedding Anniversary. We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome And We Would Like To Compliment You On The High Standards Your Staff Maintain.,,,,,,
,560,An Enjoyable Stay Nonetheless. Thank You.,,,,,,
,561,The Bar Staff Didn't Serve Full Pints Of Cobra. They Needed Topping Up. Girl On The Bar Seemed Flustered With Bar Customers And Had Issues With The Till.,,,,,,
,566,A Really Enjoyable Experience. We Loved The Fact We Had Bleinham Tickets As Well As The Stay At The Hotel. Really Good Value For Money. Staff Were Helpful And Welcoming  Especially In The Restaurant. Thanks For A Lovely Weekend!,,,,,,
,571,It Might Have Been Nice To Have Been Informed That We May Be Woken Early By Deliveries (Which Was The Case...5-6Am!) & The Gin & Tonics Were Very Expensive!,,,,,,
,575,As Part Of A Travelzoo Offer  We Had Paid For A Tasting Meal Worth Â£55.  However  On The Evening That We Dined  The Menu Showed That The Price Was Â£45.  The Fact That The Chef Had Decided To Reduce The Price Does Not Detract From The Fact That The Offer Included The Higher Price.,,,,,,
,578,The Saturday Was Fabulous But The Sunday Wad Disappointing And Spoilt My Impression From The Day Before. I Have Already Mentioned Breakfast. Regarding The Bill It Was Lucky I Had Brought With The Email Confirming Our Offer From The Peugeot Magazine. The Bill We Initially Received Did Not Take The Offer Into Account And Was For Over Â£100 More. The Next Bill Was For Â£10 Or So For The Extras. I Was Honest Enough To Point Out That We Needed To Pay The Â£ 299 Offer Price Too.  After We Left I Realised The 3Rd Bill Was Wrong Too As We Had Been Charged For After Dinner Coffee And Petit Fours Rather Than The Tea On Arrival. I Wasn't Going To Go Back For Â£4 But That Was Sloppy. It Was A Shame As We Were Really Bowled Over By Everything The Day Before. I Would Be Happy For You To  Contact Me About All This On 07775672103 Lesley,,,,,,
,580,Thank You For Making Our Stay So Memorable - My Mother Thoroughly Enjoyed Her Birthday And We Would Both Look To Return In The Near Future.,,,,,,
,581,I Felt The Hotel Was Extremely Over Priced. I Work For An Airline So I Did Get Around Â£60 Discount. The Hotel Stay Was A Gift To My Partner And I Really Did Expect A Higher Standard Of Accommodation For The Money I Paid. Which Is A Shame.,,,,,,
,582,We Did Enjoy The Gin Bar  But It Is Very Overpriced.,,,,,,
,585,We're Looking Forward To Visiting Again To Sample Some More Gin!!,,,,,,
,588,Excellent Hotel - First Rate.,,,,,,
,595,Very Dissappointed With The Whole Experience.,,,,,,
,601,A Fridge  Tea And Coffee Facilities In The Bedroom Would Be A Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,606,We Have Stayed With You Four Or Five Times And This Is The First Time Our Stay Has Not Been Excellent!,,,,,,
,610,Service In The Bar Was Slow. Ordered A Picnic Hamper & It Was Not Mentioned That I Had To Return It. I Had To Make The Effort To Find Out. It Was Lucky I Opened It Before I Left As I Would Have Driven Home Thinking I Had Paid For It As A Package.,,,,,,
,613,No,,,,,,
,614,I Really Liked The Personal Touch Of The Email Subsequent To My Booking Through Booking.Com.  Often When You Book Through Secondary Websites There Is No Contact Between The Confirmation Email And Arrival  So This Was A Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,619,Car Parking Was Difficult  But Outside Of Your Control.,,,,,,
,620,We Were Charged In The Room Rate For Dinner And Also Again On The Night. I Didn't Notice This Until We Got Home But It Had Been Refunded Now.,,,,,,
,621,No,,,,,,
,623,Uninspiring (Sad Looking) Breakfast Table,,,,,,
,631,Previously The Breakfast Was Awful. The Polish Waiter Did Not Understand English And Insisted That The Parma Ham Was Lincolnshire Ham. Clearly Ridiculous And Extremely Aggravating.,,,,,,
,635,You Perhaps Should Consider A Loyalty Reward? We Have Stayed At Your Hotel Many Times And I Think That Would Be A Nice Gesture To Regular Guests?,,,,,,
,636,If You Can Prove To Me That The Hotel Is Back To Its Prior Form We May Come Again But You Are Probably Not Interested In Us As We Are But 2 Of Many-But I Do Think You Will Lose All The Loyal Customers Like Us If The Hotel Continues As We Found It Last Sunday.,,,,,,
,637,I Was Not Too Keen On Being Presented With My Bill With The Service Charge Already Added As A Done Deal.  I Would Have Preferred There To Have Been A Space On The Bill To Add A Discretionary Tip Of My Choosing. I Ended Up Having To Ask The Receptionist To Remove It & Add A Smaller Amount - The Irony Being That Had I Been Given The Choice In The First Place As Opposed To Being Told What To Pay Then I Would Probably Have Paid The Higher Amount!,,,,,,
,639,Nothing To Do With You But I Left My Sleeping Ware In Room 43. Would Be Happy To Pay Postage If You Cpuld Send It Back,,,,,,
,641,Thank You For A Lovely Evening - We Look Forward To Coming Back.,,,,,,
,646,Suite 4 Was Superb,,,,,,
,647,We Had A Lovely Stay...The Service Was Excellent And We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome. The Room Was Not As Clean As We Would Have Expected...Dead Beetle In The Chest Of Draws  Ornate Mirror In Need Of A Good Clean An Polish... Breakfast Was Scrummy  And The Room We Were Given Was Very Lovely. Thank You,,,,,,
,648, Breakfast The First Morning  There Was Nobody To Meet Us. We Waited 10 Mins Only To Hear Raucous Laughter Coming From The Kitchen. Eventually We Ordered Tea. Which When We Poured Out The Milk Into The Milk It Fell Out  It Was Solid And Rotten. Nobody Must Have Checked It. Very Poor Indeed.,,,,,,
,651,My Only Comment Would Be Â£18.50 For A G&T. I Genuinely Do Not Mind Paying For The Exceptional But This Was Not  Don't Know If There Was An Issue  It Tasted Like A G&T But Have Certainly Had Better For Far Less.,,,,,,
,654,The Whole Experience Was A Total Shambles  I Have Had Better Treatment From A Premier Inn . I Usually Stay At The Bear . In Future I Will Be Staying At The Bear,,,,,,
,655,Only That This Survey Has Made Me Check My Final Account And I Have Realised That It Is Incorrect. The Final Invoice Shows That 2 Sb Glasses Of Wine Were Served In The Bar. However We Only Took A Total Of 5 Glasses Of Wine  Not 7 - All Served In The Restaurant. My Fault For Not Fully Checking The Details At The Checkout.,,,,,,
,656,Would Not Have Booked Hotel Had We Known About The Fair,,,,,,
,660,Thank You,,,,,,
,663,The Key For Me Was A Short-Notice Trip And My Office Was Being Able To Book By Telephone Mid Sunday Evening And Be Able To Arrive At 1.0 Am With The Night Staff At Reception.,,,,,,
,664,Love This Hotel.  Hope You Can Keep Up The High Standards.  We Will Definitely Be Back.  Many Thanks,,,,,,
,669,Very Good Could Have Been Excellent,,,,,,
,670,I Had Booked This Break For My Husband's Birthday And We Were Not Disappointed.  Good Value For Money For A Winter Break In A Cosy Hotel In A Beautiful Village.  Would Love To Return When Weather Is Better!,,,,,,
,674,The Furniture In The Study And The Bar Lounge Seemed Out Of Keeping With The Hotel - Lacked Personality.,,,,,,
,680,I Would Like To Thank You For Your Kind Attention To Us And For Fulfilling Your Promise To Provide 3 Free Rooms To Us Because We Had Some Problems When We Stayed At New Year.  Please Know That Honour Is Definitely Satisfied And We Would Now Happily Recommend You.,,,,,,
,688,When We Checked Out We Were Charged 10% On Our Whole Bill But Changed To To The Meal Only. I Dont Think We Should Be Charging Service On The Room Even If It's Optional.,,,,,,
,689,I Feel I Received Value For Money At The Promotion Price. I Would Have Been Disappointed With The Overall Experience If I Had Paid The Rate Quoted On Your Website.,,,,,,
,690,Couldnt Get The Phone To Ring '0'  The Reception.,,,,,,
,692,You Have A Lovely Little Hotel In A Lovely Location. I Felt We Had Good Value In Our Accommodations.  My Criticisms Are Relatively Minor; However  More Attention To Ambiance And Beauty  Especially Outside And In The Rooms Would Be Desirable.,,,,,,
,703,Glad We Didn't Pay Full Price For The Feathers Experience!!,,,,,,
,705,We Had A Fab Stay And The Above Comments Are A Guide Not Criticism  Thank You,,,,,,
,706,Parking Can Be A Challenge! But  We'll Be Back,,,,,,
,708,We Have Stayed A Few Times And Never Had Any Cause For Comment Other Than Positive But This Stay Was Disappointing For Me Personally.,,,,,,
,710,We Did Overall Enjoy Our Stay At The Hotel And Would Return To The Same Room If We Were Staying In The Area Again. Just A Couple Of Points That Would Have Made It Top Notch.,,,,,,
,714,Our Friends David And Justine Edwards Arrive On Sunday With Our Daughter - They Deserve A Good Break And Won't Be Disappointed !,,,,,,
,717,Enjoyed Our Stay. Thank You All.,,,,,,
,723,The Staff Were Super Helpful And Friendly! I Have Stayed In Many 5 Star Hotels For Work  And None Has Service As Friendly And Courteous And What You Have. Your Staff Are A Great Asset To Your Hotel. They Should All Wear A Name Badge So I Could Have Better Commended Them.,,,,,,
,724,Really Helpful Staff That Are Always There To Help If Needed. Lovely Hotel Which Is Extremely Clean And Comfortable And The Food Just Adds To The Luxury!,,,,,,
,727,My Boyfriend Adored A Piece Of Artwork In The Reception Area And I Meant To Find Out If Any Of It Was For Sale But Completely Forgot...Is Any Of It For Sale??,,,,,,
,728,Excellent,,,,,,
,729,The Experience Of Our Stay Was Lovely And Would Want To Stay Again. Just A Shame The Resturant Let You Down,,,,,,
,742,No.,,,,,,
,743,You Did Ask For My Comments And I Believe I Have Been Honest And Constructive. The Feathers Is A Lovely Hotel And Apart From A Few Items Was The Perfect Place For Myself And My Daughter (Who Has Three Children) To Relax. We Would Certainly Stay Again But I Will Have To Bring A Fan Etc.,,,,,,
,752,Probably The Best Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In.,,,,,,
,754,Many Thanks For A Magical Evening And Stay.,,,,,,
,761,No Thanks.,,,,,,
,762,No,,,,,,
,763,Please Keep It Up And We'll Certainly Be Back! We Have Really Enjoyed The Taster Menus That Have Previously Been Available For Dining Options. Would Love To See This Back. Also  A Breakfast Menu / Arrival Info Pack Would Have Been Useful In The Room. Thanks For Making Our Stay So Enjoyable Once Again,,,,,,
,766,All Staff Were Fantastic  V Attentive And Informative. However A Few Basic Needs Were Lacking- Food And Sleep! Unfortunately Not Luxurious As I Think The Hotel Wants To Be Perceived As.,,,,,,
,768,A Very Difficult One In Such A Beautiful Old Building - Try And Resolve The Creaking Floorboards In Room 28 Both For The Occupants And Those In The Room Below?,,,,,,
,774,Nice Comfy Bed And Fabulous Bathroom. Nice To Have The Small Sitting Room To Use After Dinner. Great Location.,,,,,,
,788,The Bill Was Quickly Rectified Without Fuss At The End.  I Wouldn't Stay In Suite 5 Again - Purely Because Of The Road Noise  The Noise From The Restaurant And From Revellers In The Square Outside.  I'd Happily Return Again.  Charming Place And Staff Who Were Helpful And Attentive.,,,,,,
,791,Lovely Overall Experience. Will Be Coming Back As Soon As We Are Able ,,,,,,
,797,No,,,,,,
,801,The Final Account Was Inaccurate  But In Our Favour! We  Of Course  Queried The Exceptional Value And Paid Up!,,,,,,
,804,Keep Us The Good Work,,,,,,
,805,Keep Up The Great Work,,,,,,
,809,Just Want To Say That Our Expectations Were Very High Having Stayed At The Feathers Before And You Did Not Disappoint!  It Is Also Some Kind Of Record For Us To Stay At The Same Hotel Three Times In One Year!!,,,,,,
,810,Thanks ,,,,,,
,823,Generally More Relaxed And Friendly Atmosphere,,,,,,
,826,The Fire Was Most Welcome For Festive Stay We Went Into The Bear For Coffee  No Fire And Drab,,,,,,
,829,No  Loved Your Village  Gorgeous Location.,,,,,,
,837,It Was A Shame That My Complaints Outweighed My Positive Comments.  I Probably Would Try Again And Then If The Situation Stayed The Same I Would Not Stay Again. The Staff Though Were Polite And Friendly And Apologetic. ,,,,,,
,838,If You Have Other Offers Available Through Amazon Local We Will Definitely Return. Unfortunately Your Normal Rates Are A Bit Too Expensive For Us To Return In The Near Future.,,,,,,
,841,Not Enough Night Staff As The Same Girl Had To Keep Running Around For Us ,,,,,,
,844,I Have Stayed Here Many Times But Not In Its Current Incarnation.  Overall I Was Very Pleased Especially With The Cost As I Made A Last Minute Booking.  Sorry But I Do Not Like The Dining Room Carpet Or The Chairs - They Are Somewhat Incongruous.  Loved The Bar Area And Am Now On A Mission To Find The Gin And Tonic That I Tried.,,,,,,
,846,A Lovely Experince For Our Pearl Wedding Anniversary. Have Already Recommended You And We Will Remember Our Stay Fondly For Years To Come,,,,,,
,847,We Look Forward To Our Concerns Being Addressed For When We Next Stay With You?,,,,,,
,848,Will Definitely Keep My Eye Out For Any Future Offers!,,,,,,
,852,If We Were Visiting The Area Again We Would Definitely Use The Hotel Again And Will Recommend It.,,,,,,
,854,Enjoyed Our Stay   Recommended It To Others And Would Live To Come Back,,,,,,
,857,Hotel Side Excellent  Dining Let Down By Less Engaged Staff,,,,,,
,858,We Really Enjoyed It And All The Comments Are Really Intended To Be Constructive ,,,,,,
,862,Very Disappointed As We Had Been Looking Forward To My Partners Christmas Present Following A Previous Visit Which Was Lovely,,,,,,
,866,Just Keep E-Mailing Me About Offers  Dining Etc,,,,,,
,868,See Comment On Alcohol,,,,,,
,869,We Will Be Back For Sure  And Next Time We Will Tour The Palace!,,,,,,
,871,We Had A Very Enjoyable Christmas,,,,,,
,875,The Whole Team Made Our Stay Comfortable And Enjoyable.,,,,,,
,876,Room Service With The Teas And Coffees Was A Nice Touch And Very Efficient Service. Its A Shame That Our Expectations Weren't Met On So Many Levels As I Was Hoping And Wanting To Really Like The Feathers Hotel. It Was Meant As A Special Treat To My Wife  But Wasn't That Special.  I Think For The Kind Of Rate (I Paid £462 For The Room For Two Nights)  I Would Expect A Certain Level Of Service Alongside The Fabulous Furniture And Decor Of The Hotel - Unfortunately  The Service Didn't Meet The Standard Set By The Environment.,,,,,,
,877,The Receptionist Amended The Final Bill Quickly When An Item Had Been Added In Error. ,,,,,,
,879,Thank You,,,,,,
,882,Thank You For A Wonderful Stay. ,,,,,,
,884,We Were Sad That We Had Not Enjoyed Our Stay . We Were Looking Forward To Returning To The Feathers But It Failed In Our Expectations And Has Certainly Fallen Below Standard. We Noticed A Definite Difference From Previous Stays And Not For The Better. Unfortunately We Will Not Be Returning Unless There Is Improvement!,,,,,,
,889,The Food Was Remarkably Good. We Loved The Music On Nye  Though The Dance Floor Was Cramped And When It Was Vacated We Moved A Table.,,,,,,
,890,No,,,,,,
,891,No.,,,,,,
,892,I Think I Covered Everything. Many Thanks!,,,,,,
,893,I Think We'll Be Back But Perhaps Not Eat In The Hotel  Which We Generally Don't Normally Do Anyway. ,,,,,,
,894,Just To Say That 3 Drinks Had Been Added To Our Dining Bill That Wasn't Ours. Not A Major Error And It Was Sorted Out Very Quickly And Without Any Fuss.,,,,,,
,895,We Are Looking Forward To Our Next Stay.,,,,,,
,896,No,,,,,,
,898,We Were Delighted That We Could Bring Our Dog To The Hotel. It Was Also Terrific That He Could Be With Us While Dining  (In The Bar)  As It Could Have Been Difficult Leaving Him In The Room. Every Member Of Your Staff Was More Than Helpful In This Regard  Which Helped To Make Our Weekend At The Feathers A Delight. Thank You. ,,,,,,
,899,Look Forward To Returning,,,,,,
,900,At First I Hesitated To Book With You As You Were Offering A Two Night Stay For New Year Which We Couldn't Do  But I'm Glad It Was Possible To Reconfigure It Just For 31/12 It Suited Us And Was A Nice Change To See The New Year In With You.,,,,,,
,901,The Only Problem With The Account Was That A Bottle Of Champagne We Ordered Was Not On The Bill  But That Was Easily Remedied! ,,,,,,
,905,Asked For Our Night Caps At The Bar To Be Delivered To Our Suite. Bar Man Assured Us That Was Fine And Would Send Up. 45 Mins Later No Sign! Husband Went Downstairs To Find Said Bar Man Gone Home. So New Order Placed And Finally Received Over An Hour After Original Order.,,,,,,
,906,Discrepancy With The Bill But Soon Sorted Out.,,,,,,
,915,Keep Up The Great Work...,,,,,,
,918,The Hotel Is Meant To Be 4 Stars But Was Badly Let Down By A Large Number Of Small Errors. Each Time The Staff Were Apologetic And Tried To Put Things Right But This Number Of Mistakes Is Not Acceptable For A Hotel Of This Purported Standard  Hence Not Recommending It To Friends,,,,,,
,922,I Had Ordered Flowers For My Wife's Birthday - They Were In The Room On Arrival And Were Very Good. My Wife Particularly Appreciated The Card From The Manager. A Nice Personal Touch.,,,,,,
,925,No!,,,,,,
,927,Just To Thank You For A Most Enjoyable Stay,,,,,,
,928,Your Email 123 Offer Tempted Us To Return Again In February  Which We Probably Would Not Normally Do.,,,,,,
,929,If We Can Get A Last Minute Booking At That Sort Of Price We Would Be Interested,,,,,,
,930,A Pamphlet About The Gin Bar And Its History Would Have Been Interesting As Its So Unique.,,,,,,
,932,No,,,,,,
,933,I Booked The Gin O'clock Package And Was Told That I Would Get An Annual Pass To Blenheim Palace Sent To My Address (It Wasn't Open When We Visited). I Have Not Received It Yet Or Any Communication About It.,,,,,,
,938,No  Except That We Have Already Recommended The Feathers To Some Of Our Friends.,,,,,,
,943,No,,,,,,
,944,Shower Caps In The Bathroom Would Have Been Useful.,,,,,,
,947,No,,,,,,
,949,Wonderful Location For A Quiet Getaway,,,,,,
,957,Only Problem Was I Did Not Receive An Email To Confirm My Booking As Requested ,,,,,,
,964,We Consider The Lounge And Bar Areas Too Limited,,,,,,
,965,Thank You For Everything.,,,,,,
,968,Really Appreciated The Free Room Upgrade. Especially As Room We Enjoyed On Our Previous Stay. Most Considerate,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
