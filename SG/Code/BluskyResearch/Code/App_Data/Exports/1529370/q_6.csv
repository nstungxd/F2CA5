,786,Lovely Stay.,,,,,,
,787,Relaxed  Efficient  Friendly And Good Value.,,,,,,
,788,Really Lovely - It Was Just What We Wanted!,,,,,,
,790,Very Good  Food And Gin Were Amazing  And Great To Have To Free Pass To Blenheim. He Had Room 51  Really We'll Decorated And Appointed  Only Negative Points Were The Noisy Staircase On The Other Side Of The Wall To The Bed Head (Not Too Much You Can Do About That Though I Guess!) And The Water Pressure Of The Shower Was Very Low. Other Than That We Had A Great Stay ,,,,,,
,791,First Class. We Had A Lovely Visit  As We Always Do. ,,,,,,
,792,We Feel Like 'At Home.',,,,,,
,794,A Very Luxurious Stay! Great Food  Lovely Service And Comfy Room.,,,,,,
,795,Very Luxurious  Comfortable  Lovely Room And Bed. Excellent Selection Of Gin!,,,,,,
,796,Food Good Although Breakfast Buffet For Those Who Don't Want Cooked Breakfast Was A Bit Thin On Choice. No Croissants Even! Room Nice But Small,,,,,,
,797,My Husband & I Enjoyed Ourselves The Staff Were Friendly & Attentive. We Did Feel That In A Reasonably Short Period Of Time The Feathers Was Looking A Tad Sad & We Were Dissapointed That Food That We Had So Enjoyed On Our Previous Stay Was Not Available. That Doesn't Mean The Food Was Poor This Visit Just That The Astonishing Quality That We Had Relished With The Chef's Menu Was Not To Be.,,,,,,
,798,Absolutely Divine  A Big Bloke Even Carried Our Bags Up! The Room Was Fabulous And Breakfast A Real Experience  Superb. Thank You.,,,,,,
,799,It Was A Little Treat In The Working Week As The Rate - £89 - Was Competitive.  ,,,,,,
,800,Short But Sweet,,,,,,
,801,Couldn't Be Faulted  Service Excellent. Only Small Comment Is That The Pillows Are Too Soft!,,,,,,
,803,As There Did Not Appear To Be A Manager In Charge We Found Most Of The Staff Although Polite And Friendly Very  Inexperienced.  ,,,,,,
,804,Lovely Room  Great Staff Which Made The Weekend.,,,,,,
,805,Absolutely Perfect,,,,,,
,806,Staff Were Excellent  Couldn't Be More Helpful. Slightly Disappointed With The Meal Portions  But This Did Not Spoil Our Stay. Quite Impressed With The Gin Bar  And Would Suggest You Advertise This More Prominently. Once Again Thank The Staff On Our Behalf.,,,,,,
,807,Exactly What Was Required,,,,,,
,808,Good,,,,,,
,809,Warmth  Style  Comfort  Relaxation.......,,,,,,
,810,Good Valu With Helpful Staff,,,,,,
,811,Comfortable Room  Good Food Great Gin Bar And Above All Friendly Staff Made Our Stay Special.,,,,,,
,812,Really Lovely,,,,,,
,813,My Daughter And I Enjoyed A Lovely Evening At Your Hotel All The Staff Were Extremely Helpful And Polite And The Setting Was Perfect. Thank You Very Much Jessica Emery,,,,,,
,814,Good Time Had Whilst We Stayed At The Feathers. The Service And Food Was Of A Very High Standard. The Room We Had Was A Little Tired. The Plug In The Bath Did Not Work And We Had To Call For Assistance. This Came Very Quickly But We Were Told That It Is A Known Fault And Needed To Be Repaired........Why Put Someone In The Room When It Has A Known Concern. Also  Our Room Had A Lovely Mirror On The Dressing Table. It Could Not Be Used As It Just Swings On Its Hinges And Does Not Stay In Place. A Little Sad. I'm Sure Your Other Rooms Are Of A Very High Standard As The Hotel Came Highly Recommended. We Look Forward To Trying Out Another Room In The Future.,,,,,,
,815,I Think You Need To Get Your Front Door Key Situation Sorted And Ensure That Everyone Who Is Booked Into A Room Has A Key - As That Was An Aspect Which Was Slightly Odd About My Short Overnight Stay Where Two People Were On A Different Schedule Of Work.  Secondly I Think You Need To Be Very Clear Why You Dont Have Kettles In The Town House ( I Guess Fire Regs Or Insurance Right?) And To Make It Really Clear That If Someone Would Like Morning Tea Or Afternoon Tea Served In The Room At A Discounted Rate (Because You Are Not M Aking Available The Option To Have This In Your Room Made By Yourself) They Are To Feel Really Cool About Disturbing You Guys To Bring It Over - Or To Also Offer Afternoon Tea In Your Lounge At Discount As Part Of The Package With That Room Option. It Would Have Helped If You Had A Bottle (.75 L) Of Water In The Room With A Couple Of Glasses Instead - Which Sort Of Sends The Same Hospitality Message As A Kettle And Teacups Do In Standard Larger Hotel Operations.   It Was Also Confusing As To Which Breakfast Was Entailed In The Package I Booked In For And Some More Clarity On That One As We Booked In Would Have Been Good. I Think That You Are Definitely Missing A Trick By Not Mentioning That You Have Wifi - Indeed Free Wi Fi Across Your Accomodation - As I Nearly Didnt Book Into The Feathers As It Was Not Mentioned And I Knew That My Partner Was Thinking Of Doing Some Work Whilst I Was Out At My Meeting - Some Of The Sites You Have Put Your Details On Do Not Mention This And You Need To Put That Right For Business Overnighters If Not Those Taking A Break! Many Thanks,,,,,,
,816,Beautiful Old Hotel With A Very Gracious And Welcoming Staff.  The Room Was Lovely. It Was Old But Beautifully Updated In Such A Way That Everything Worked Together.  The Staff Is Fantastic And Will Even Deliver Coffee To Your Room In The Morning As Part Of The Service. ,,,,,,
,817,Ok,,,,,,
,818,Nice Ambiance  Great Food  Friendly Staff  Overall Great Stay We Will Be Back Next Year Hopefully.,,,,,,
,820,Comfortable Luxury Home From Home ,,,,,,
,821,Much More Relaxed Than Previous Visits Restaurant Had A More Relaxed Feel And Portion Sizes Were Improved Reservation Staff Very Helpful And All Staff Excellent During Stay Definately Our Favourite Visit To Date.,,,,,,
,823,Pitch Perfect For An Overnight Treat,,,,,,
,824,Lovely,,,,,,
,825,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Ladies Shopping Trip. We Received A Friendly Welcome From Reception And Our Room Was Upgraded. The Bar Is A Very Relaxing Place  The Only Downside Is The Lack Of Snacks Offered. There Were Only Olives Available Which Are Not To Everyones Taste. Other Nibbles Would Have Been Great Whilst Having An Early Evening Drink. We May Have Stayed In The Bar Longer If This Had Been The Case. The Food And Service In The Restaurant  Both At Dinner And Breakfast Was First Class.,,,,,,
,826,Our Only Problem Was The Size Of The Bed Which The Receptionist Said She Would Change Our Room But We Decided To Stay Put.  Have Put On Favourable Report On Trip Adviser,,,,,,
,827,Very Lovely Room - We Got An Upgrade - Excellent Food And Very Friendly Staff.,,,,,,
,828,Very Good In The Restaurant And Bar.  Reception Polite But Weak,,,,,,
,829,It Was Ok  The Staff Were Very Helpful  We Found The Atmosphere Slightly Sterile  No Music  A Wee Bit Crafty In The Dining Room   The Room Was Really Cosy And The Bed Comfortable.,,,,,,
,830,We've Stayed At The Feathers Many Times Over The Years In A Variety Of Rooms (Including The Excellent Suite 4) And It's Usually A Very Pleasant Place To Stay. We Had An Issue With A Generator Located In The Basement Under Our Room - Number 51. It Kept Resetting Itself Every Few Seconds. I Mentioned It To The Receptionist Around 7Pm And She Did All She Could To Resolve It - And For A Few Hours It Was All Quiet. Unfortunately Around 11Pm It Started Up Again And Carried On Through The Night - I Felt It Too Late To Mention Again So Did My Best To Get Some Sleep.We Will Be Returning - Probably Using The £149 Room Offer We Were Given By Your Staff - Sometime In February / March 2014 But We'd Like To Avoid Room 51 If Possible! It Also Suffers From Being On The Ground Floor And Next To A Set Of Very Noisy Stairs! Other Than This The Food Was Good And The Staff Pleasant As Ever. ,,,,,,
,831,Perfect - Although Room Was A Little Small!  Food Was Amazing And Staff Very Welcoming! ,,,,,,
,832,Stay Was Good Overall. However We Were Slightly Disappointed With The Food. We Chose To Have Dinner At The Hotel - Main Course Was Good. The Tarte Tatin Was Unlike Any Other Tarte Tatin I Have Had! No Caramelisation Of The Apple But 3 Slices Of Apple On Top Of Each Other Only Just About Cooked! The Icecream However Was Very Good.  Breakfast - The Addition Of A Fruit Salad Would Be Nice. Some Of The Toast Was Very Burnt.  ,,,,,,
,833,Very Enjoyable (Although We Booked For Another Couple And Didn't Stay) The Meal We Had Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,834,Everything Was Excellent  As Expected From Reccomendation.,,,,,,
,835,The Staff Were Polite And Welcoming And Our Room Was Nice And Clean.    Things To Note  Our Room Was A Disabled Room And Therefore The Bathroom Facilities Were Not What We Were Expecting.  We Had Not Been Told Of This When We Booked.  Our Room (52) You Can Hear The People Upstairs Moving About  Quite Clearly  Which Was Annoying When They Were Constantly Walking About The Room At 11Pm At Night.  Our Room Had No Wifi  Which My Husband Needed To Do Some Work  But The Duty Manager Did Give Us A Reduction In The Rate For This  Which Was Very Kind And The Right Thing To Do. Breakfast Was A Disappointment  I Ordered Eggs Benedict  On Apparently A Home Made Muffin.  When It Came It Has Serrano Ham (Which It Should Not Have Been) And The Homemade Muffin Was A Toasted Sesame Seed Burger Bun! Apart From All This  The Hotel Was Nicely Decorated  Clean And All Staff Were Courteous.,,,,,,
,836,Good Room And Good Food. Only Downside Was No Parking,,,,,,
,837,It Was Ok. There Was No Tea And Coffee In Room. Struggled To Stay Connected To Internet. Chef Didn't Arrive In Morning So We Couldn't Have A Cooked Breakfast. Very Disappointing.,,,,,,
,838,Could Not Find Fault!!!!  Very Relaxing  Excellent Food  Excellent Service.  Thank You Very Much!,,,,,,
,839,Lovely Staff. Comfortable Bed! Enjoyed The Gun Bar,,,,,,
,840,We Enjoyed The Hotel. The Front Desk Were Very Kind And Attentive. The Room Was Comfortable .A Mirror Is Badly Needed In The Bathroom. I Believe It Was Room 36.  Breakfast Buffet Choice Was Quite Poor!  We Would Come Back. ,,,,,,
,841,Charming Personal Service  Friendly And Very Helpful. Great Suite Number 5  Very Spacious And Full Of Character. Dana Was Superb! ,,,,,,
,842,Service Was Good  Especially By The Fellow At Breakfast  Bath Taps Poor Quality And Too Complicated ! ,,,,,,
,843,We Had A Wonderful Time And Delighted To Be Upgraded To A Suite As It Was My Husbands Birthday. Not Likely To Stay Again As We Live Quite Close But Would Visit For Dinner And Recommend ,,,,,,
,844,The Room Was Very Comfortable And The Good Very Good.  The Staff Were Also Very Good Although They Kept Getting My Name And Title Wrong.  Just Because Iw As A Woman Travellign Alone Does Not Mean I Am Single.  My Title Is Actually Dr But I Was Referred To As Miss.  Overall Though My Stay Was Very Nice.,,,,,,
,845,A Most Enjoyable Stay.The Hotel Was Very Welcoming Rooms Very Comfortable And The Cuisine Excellent.Also Enjoyed Pre Dinner Gin And Tonics In The Excellent Gin Bar.,,,,,,
,846,Excellent Service. All The Staff Were Great - Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. Only Two Suggestions - We Asekd The Waietr What Two Things Were On Our Plates - He Didn't Know - We Think He Ought To. And Fix The Glass In The Bathroom Window - There Is A Gap Betweeen Glass And Frame In Eagle Suite,,,,,,
,847,All Staff And Reception Always Excellent  This Visit And Previous. This Visit Staff Seemed A Bit More Stressed? Breakfasts  In Room  Late Both Mornings  But  Served With Nice Apologies. Dinner  On Our Second Night  Was Slow On Service And The Main Course Was Served  Not Hot  And Without One Of The Vegetables  Which  When Queried  Came Cold In A Side Dish? We Did Report These Issues Before We Checked Out. A Shame  Because We Do Like The Hotel.   ,,,,,,
,848,Our Experience Was Far Better Than Our Expectations.  The Staff Were Exceptional  And We Felt No Request Would Have Been Too Much.  Our Room Was Beautifully Clean  And Every Aspect Was To A High Standard.  Our Meal Was Amazing  And We Even Had A Surprise Of An Extra Course  Personalised For Our Wedding Anniversary.  Our Thanks To All Staff  And Compliments To The Chef.,,,,,,
,849,Elegant  Calm  Classy Surroundings And A Delicious Breakfast Served In A Beautiful Restaurant.,,,,,,
,851,Lovely Hotel Always A Pleasure To Visit. Staff Very Helpful Even When Extremely Busy  Food Is Very Good And Service Excellant  Will Certainly Return.   ,,,,,,
,852,Excellent Service From Friendly Staff; Although We Had One Of The Smaller Rooms It Was Comfortable And Well Appointed; Excellent Food Both In The Evening And Breakfast. Loved The Gin Bar. It Was Pleasant To Be Able To Sit In Comfort And Privacy Prior To Our Meal In The Evening. Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.,,,,,,
,853,Friendly  Helpful Staff. Very Comfortable Room ( Peacock) Good Food And Gin!,,,,,,
,854,Lovely Staff  Nice Room  Loved Woodstock,,,,,,
,857,Excellent Room. Good Value Package,,,,,,
,858,A Charming Hardworking Team Ensured A Lovely Stay. The Effort Was 100%. The Result Was 85% The Difference Was The Fact That A Lot Of The Team Were Clearly New To Their Jobs; Courteous And Keen But Still Building Experience . The Room Was Outstanding And The Way Staff Endeavoured To Make Us Comfortable Was Also Very Good. The Front Of House Could Perhaps Have Done With An Extra Pair Of Hands But This May Not Be Valid When The Team Is All Firing On All Cylinders . The Food Was Very Good Off A Narrow Menu . Enough For Us But Fussy People Might Think It Too Short.,,,,,,
,859,Outstanding Comfort And Hospitality In A Style Combining The Best Of Old And New.,,,,,,
,860,Friendly Staff  Great Rooms And Fantastic Food. ,,,,,,
,861,Thr Room Did Not Meet Our Expectations. Although We Accept The Price Had Been Slashed The Previosly Advertised Price Gave The Impression That This Was A Superior Style Room.However The Overall Experience Was Very Pleasant.,,,,,,
,862,Sadly It Was Very Ordinary As Compared With A Previous Visit About 2 Years Ago,,,,,,
,863,Great Service Throughout Is Your Strongest Feature. Food Excellent. Our Room At The Top Of The Hotel  Was Ok  Could Of Been A Little More Updated. Overall Loved It. ,,,,,,
,866,Everything Was Perfect  We Stayed About Three Years Ago And Always Wanted To Come Back Again. ,,,,,,
,867,Very Enjoyable.,,,,,,
,868,Excellent And Helpful Welcome In Reception.  Lovely Room And Facilities.  Meal Ok But Not Memorable.  Drinks Far Too Expensive  £72 For 3 Double Brandies.  The Price Of Alcohol Woukld Put Me Off Staying Again Or Recommending It To Friends,,,,,,
,869,We Were Looking For A Real Christmas Experience And Getaway With My 93 Year Od Mother In Law And We Found It At The Feathers.  Truly  All Of Our Expectations Were Exceeded..The Food Was Amazing  The Service Outstanding And Everyone Was Friendly And Helpful.  A Wonderful Holiday!,,,,,,
,870,Very Nice,,,,,,
,871,A Very Relaxing Christmas With Excellent Food And Friendly Service Throughout.,,,,,,
,873,Breakfast Was Awesome...,,,,,,
,874,Wonderful Christmas,,,,,,
,875,Restful And Enjoyable.,,,,,,
,876,Unfortunately The Water (Not The Fault Of The Hotel) Was Off When We Arrived  So My Wife Couldn't Have The Bath She Was Looking Forward To  And Toilets Couldn't Be Flushed For About 4 Hours - Not A Great Start! When I Asked The Receptionist For Some Water To Be Able To Wash My Hands With  She Had To Go And Check If That Was Ok Before Getting Me A Couple Of Bottles!!  Staff Were Friendly Enough  And The Food  Drink  And Accommodation Was Excellent And Relaxing  But The Main Reason I Was Disappointed Was That I Specifically Mentioned That It Was My Wife's Birthday During Booking  And Nothing Was Done To Honour That Fact - Perhaps A Small Cake With A Candle Could Have Been A Nice Gesture. Instead  We Got A "Happy Birthday" As We Walked Out Of The Restaurant  Despite My Re-Iterating To Staff It Is My Wife's Birthday At The Start Of The Meal  To Which I Got A "We Know!" Making Me Think That Some Small Token Was Imminent...   Having Stayed At Many Other Hotels It Is Not Uncommon To Have A Gesture Like This And A Bit Of Thought From Your Staff Would've Gone A Long Way  Unfortunately On This Occasion It Didn't.  When Checking Out  We Had Been Charged For Glasses Of Wine With The Meal Which We Didn't Have! I Think The Gin With The Gin Fusion Menu Was Quite Enough Without The Need For Wine Too! A Bit Embarrassing Having To Explain That During Checkout!  Not Quite Up To Our Expectations I'm Afraid!,,,,,,
,877,Very Enjoyable And Staff Very Helpful And Friendly. The Room Was Really Good. ,,,,,,
,878,Food Good  Rooms Good  Service Good,,,,,,
,879,The Staff Could Not Have Been More Accommodating  Really Made My Stay A Pleasure!,,,,,,
,881,Service Was Great However The Room Had A Very Noisy Fan  Switched Off The One In Our Bathroom But Still There Was A Bad Noise All Night. ,,,,,,
,882,Lovely. Friendly  Warm  Welcoming  Outstanding Food  Beautiful Facilities. ,,,,,,
,883,Excellent Accommodation  Attentive Staff  Awful Weather,,,,,,
,884,Disappointing. We  Have Stayed Before And Noticed A Definite Deterioration In The Overall Standard,,,,,,
,885,Wonderfully Relaxed - The Suite Was Beautiful And All Service Was Great,,,,,,
,886,Food Excellent Service Slow For Afternoon Tea As We Were On Package Not Very Organised Re Timings Of Afternoon Teas Etc And On New Year's Eve We Had To Ask For Our Drink On Arrival We Purchased A Martini 007 And Wasn't As Shown In Advertisement And Were Treated Slightly Second Class Citizens On That Evening Making Us Feel A Bit Shoved In Background - Other Than That Room Was Lovely And Food Excellent,,,,,,
,887,Rooms Were Wonderful.....The Restaurant Was Disappointing....But Overall Very Nice.,,,,,,
,889,Mostly Good,,,,,,
,890,A Relaxing Stay With Lovely Staff.,,,,,,
,891,Excellent.  Only One Minor Blemish - The Wardrobe In Our Room Was Far Too High And Would Have Needed A Step Or Ladder To Enable Us To Comfortably Hang Up Our Clothes.,,,,,,
,892,From The Moment We Arrived  We Were Treated Courteously And Helpfully By The Staff Who Bent Over Backwards To Satisfy Our Needs (Some Of Which Were Extreme!). Our Room Was Very Tastefully Decorated And Comfortable With All The Facilities We Required  We Found It Both Functional And Elegant. The Gala Dinner Food Was Better Than Expected Being Almost Fine Dining Standard - For Such Large Number Catering It Was Exceptional. Breakfast (Not Brunch?) Again Was Excellent  With A Very Good And Interesting Choice Of Dishes. The Entertainment  Although Minimal Was Very Pleasant And Just Right For The Place Available. Overall  We Were More Than Happy With The Whole Package  Which Was Difficult To Fault  And We Will Certainly Spread The Word!,,,,,,
,893,We Loved The Room And The Service Was Excellent  If We Had Perhaps Paid Full Price For Our Stay I Might Of Cared More About The Small Issues But As This Was A Amazon Local Deal I Felt That The Stay Offered Excellent Value. ,,,,,,
,894,Dear Peter Please Could You Refer To My Trip Advisor For Our Feedback. Its The Review Entitled ' A Glittering Star At The Top Of Our Christmas Tree'.,,,,,,
,895,We Really Enjoyed Our Return Visit To The Feathers For The New Year Celebration Package. The Service Was Excellent And Friendly And The Hotel Was Comfortable.,,,,,,
,896,We Very Much Appreciated The Warmth Of The Welcome And The Attention Given To Us By Your Staff.,,,,,,
,897,Enjoyed Overall Experience. ,,,,,,
,898,It Was A Lovely Couple Of Relaxing Days. We Were Looked After Perfectly By All At The Feathers. Thank You.,,,,,,
,899,Excellent Staff Very Friendly Plus A Very Nice Atmosphere ,,,,,,
,900,Nice Atmosphere For New Year's Eve  Canapes And Cocktails Started The Evening Off Well.  Lovely Dinner  Good Tastes And Well Presented Food.  Service Was Attentive And Friendly.  ,,,,,,
,901,A Good Relaxing Time. The Service Was Excellent And The Food Very Good,,,,,,
,902,Very Enjoyable. Everyone Was Great.,,,,,,
,903,Enjoyable ,,,,,,
,904,Pleasant But Not Overly Special. No-One To Take Our Bags To Our Room  Etc. The Little Things..,,,,,,
,905,Fantastic Gin Fusion Dinner And Gin Bar But Very Average Service.,,,,,,
,906,Lovely Reception Area With Pleasant Staff.  We Were Upgraded To A Suite Without Even Asking  Which Was Lovely.  The Bedroom Of Suite 2 Was Fantastic With A Very Comfortable Bed.  The Only Very Slight Problem Was That We Couldn't Tune The Television.  The Receptionist Tried To Help But She Wasn't Sire How To Do But Between Her And My Husband The Managed To Do It.  Also  The Shower In That Bedroom Need Attention As The Water Flow Is Not Very Good.  The Food In The Restaurant Was Excellent  Including The Breakfast Next Morning.,,,,,,
,907,An Enjoyable Stay But The Restaurant Service Was Disappointing  45 Minutes For The Amuse Bouche And 2.5 Hours To The Dessert.  Our Bottle Of Wine Offered To Another Table!  The Food Was Good So No Complaints There.  Room Was Good And Staff Very Friendly.,,,,,,
,908,This Was My Second Visit And We Stayed Through An Amazon Local Deal For Dinner Bed And Breakfast For £129. This Is An Excellent Deal And I Would Certainly Stay Again If I Saw A Similar Deal. The Food Was Excellent And The Service Very Good. The Only Part Of The Stay We Were Not 100% Happy With Was The Room. We Stayed In Room 14 Which Sadly Has  Very Bad Mould Issue On All Windows In The Room. This Lead To My Asthmatic Husband Struggling A Little With His Breathing By Morning. We Do Understand It Is Hard With Those Old Windows To Stop Mould Completely But The Cleaning Of The  Mould More Regularly Would Make A Huge Difference. ,,,,,,
,909,Welcoming And V Friendly Staff. Comfortable Gin Bar Exciting ,,,,,,
,910,Overall The Experience Was Good...Reception Very Helpful  Room Lovely  Bed Comfortable.  Restaurant Experience Could Have Been Better...But Generally Good. ,,,,,,
,912,Excellent; We Had A Great Time,,,,,,
,914,I Had A Lovely And Very Comfortable Room  Seems Like A Great Place For A Relaxing Weekend. The Kitchen Was Closed For Refurbishment So Didn't Get To Sample The Cuisine But Enjoyed The General Ambience Of The Hotel.,,,,,,
,915,Delightful  Despite The Problem With The Flooded Kitchen!,,,,,,
,917,Pity The Kitchen Was Flooded But We Enjoyed Dinner At The Kings Arms,,,,,,
,918,Concept Good But Lack Staff Training Led To A Poor Experience,,,,,,
,920,Excellent In Every Aspect,,,,,,
,921,Staff Were Friendly And Approachable Room Was Wonderful And Warm Tea And Coffee In Room Was A Little Hit And Miss.  First Coffee Was Stewed! It Would Be Helpful If The Team Had More Understanding Of Coealic Requirements (Not Unfriendly But Suggesting Pastries Full Of Gluten For Breakfast Is Not Going To Work!!!!)  ,,,,,,
,922,Friendly  Comfortable  Good Food.,,,,,,
,925,Ok But My Leek And Potato Soup At Supper Was Bright Green And Had A Strong Garlic Odour! At Breakfast My Egg Was Only Part Fried And No Hash Browns Available! The Chef's Morning Off Perhaps? And On The Bill I Reckon £6.60 For A Medium Sized Glass Of Bombardier Bitter Was Excessive! The Receptionist Didn't Comment To My Complaint!,,,,,,
,926,A Pleasant Yet Short Stay - Food Very Rich But Well Presented. Our Main Issue Was That Our Room Was Unbearably Hot... Quite An Uncomfortable Night Despite Opening Window. Open Fires Roaring Downstairs Were Attractive And Welcoming But Just Too Much For A Mild Feb Eve,,,,,,
,927,Excellent In Almost Every Aspect.  The Only Slight Negative (Not Worthy Of Complaint At The Time) Was The Breakfast: No Prunes  "Hotcake" With Maple Syrup And Banana Came Minus Banana And With  I Suspect  Honey But Definitely Not Maple.  Otherwise We Were Thrilled To Be Upgraded To A Fabulous Suite  Loved The Gin Bar (Saffron - Wow!) And Thoroughly Enjoyed The Taster Menu With Your Choice Of Wines.  Each Dish Was Delicious  Carefully Judged And Extremely Well-Executed.  I'm Sure We Benefited From Choosing A Week-End In Early Feb (The Upgrade) But No Doubt Your Other Rooms Are Pleasant.  Anyway  We Look Forward To Coming Back. ,,,,,,
,928,Relaxing  Good Food  And Friendly Staff,,,,,,
,929,It Was A Very Good Evening  Including The Food Which Was Good Value.,,,,,,
,930,It Was A Lovely Stay  The Staff Were Polite  Friendly And Courteous. We Loved The Room And The Quirk Of Having The Bedrooms Just Across The Road  Was A Lovely Unique Feature. Compliments To The Chef For Our Evening Meal And Lovely Smoked Salmon Breakfast. Already Planning Out Next Vist To Coincide With The Re-Opening Of Blenheim Gardens In The Spring. Thanks Again For A Lovely Couple Of Days.,,,,,,
,932,The Staff Were Efficient And Friendly And Nothing Was Too Much.  The Food Excellent.  The Bedroom Very Comfortable.,,,,,,
,933,The Welcome Was Good And The Room Was Lovely (Suite 3). I Liked That Tea And Coffe Was Brought By Room Service. Service In Both The Restuarant And Bar Was Quite Slow And Not Particularly Attentive. We Had The Gin Fusion Menu And Didn't Always Get The Gin At The Same Time As The Corresponding Course Which I Assume Is The Point. ,,,,,,
,934,Good Service And Food.,,,,,,
,935,Enjoyable,,,,,,
,936,We Stayed Here For The Gin Experience. However  There Was No Q Tonic Available (Although The Website Mentions It Specifically)  No Gin To Make The 'Ultimate G&T' As Per The List Of Drinks On The Website  And The Gin Fusion Menu Was Not At All To Our Liking (No Vegetarian Option At All). We Asked About This As It Was Not The One Which Was Offered Online. We Were Told That This Was Simply A Sample Menu  Although No Where Did It Actually Say That. The Maître D' Offered Us The Tasting Menu Instead Which We Had  But Did Not Enjoy Very Much. He Did Bring Us Gins But They Arrived A Course Too Late.
The Following Morning  The Bacon At Breakfast Was Overcooked And The Coffee Was Not Fair Trade.
Service Was Not Good. We Did Not Get A Sense That Anyone Was In Charge And During Dinner  It Was At Times Nothing Short Of Farcical.
I'm Also Disappointed That When I Booked  The Receptionist Made A Big Thing About 2 Free Tickets To Blenheim Palace. She Omitted To Mention That It Was Closed At The Time Of Our Visit. We Asked For Them When We Checked Out And Were Disappointed To Find Out That We Would Not Be Going. She Took Our Address And Promised To Send Them. It's Been Over. 2 Weeks But We Haven't Received Them.,,,,,,
,937,We Were Kindly Upgraded Free Of Charge To Room 28 We Stayed In Previously  Which Was A Lovely Consideration. Excellent Friendly Service From Reception  Dining And Aid Service. Excellent Food And Of Course The Gin Selection. I Look Forward To Our Next Stay,,,,,,
,938,We Loved The Village  The Stay At The Hotel Was Delightful. The Staff Were Lovely  Very Friendly And The Stay Was Wonderful.
,,,,,,
,939,We Have Stayed With You Previously And Noted That There Were A Couple Of Finishing Touches Which Were Absent On This Visit But Present Before. These Included Complementary Nibbles At The Bar And The Absence Of A Choice Of Salted And Unsalted Butter Served With Slices Of Bread Rather Than A Choice Of Rolls.  Whilst These Extras Were Not Our Motivation For A Return Visit  Their Absence Was Noticed. ,,,,,,
,940,Just Special In A Special Place. ,,,,,,
,941,Staff Were Lovely  Helpful Friendly And Professional. Room Was Very Small. Breakfast Poor Selection Of Freshly Prepared Fruit. Not Liking Cooked Breakfast  I Do Like A Choice Of Fruit  Not Just Melon . Real Disappointment Was When We Went Into Dinner We Were Only Offered The Tasting Menu And As There Was Nothing On There For My Husband  We Were Made To Feel Awkward When We Asked If There Was An A La Carte Menu And When We Asked For Steak Menu We Were Advised They Would Have To Go And Check If It Was Available. Why Then 
Was It Advertised Outside? When We Did Finally Get Our Fillet Steak It Was Beautiful  Perfectly Cooked.,,,,,,
,942,Superb!,,,,,,
,943,Efficient And Friendly Service  Good Food And Excellent Accommodation,,,,,,
,944,A Lovely Relaxing Stay  With Great Food And Exceptional Standards Of Cleanliness And Service,,,,,,
,945,A Wonderful Stay  Really Relaxing - Beautiful Room  Attentive Service  Generally Excellent All Round.,,,,,,
,947,Pleasant  Relaxing,,,,,,
,948,Just The Break That I Needed. The Staff Were Excellent  The Hotel Was Beautiful And I Can't Wait To Stay Again.,,,,,,
,949,A Wonderful Night Of Gin  Good Food Oustanding Rooms And Attentive Staff . Thoroughly Recommend It To Anyone Who Just Needs Some Downtime.,,,,,,
,951,A Special Time With Wonderful Food And Friends ,,,,,,
,952,Very Comfortable With Attentive Staff And Excellent Cocktails!,,,,,,
,953,Good.. Checkin In Great Very Welcoming.. Felt That The Toiletries Could Have Been Better Quality. Gin Bar Great But Could Be Much Better. Dinner Ok.. Wine Glasses Need Changing.. Very Basic. Breakfast Excellent. ,,,,,,
,957,A Very Relaxing Stay  Service Was Excellent And The Staff Were Very Friendly. Also We Loved The Large Bedroom And Bathroom. Will Definetely Be Back,,,,,,
,958,Just Lovely!,,,,,,
,959,Relaxed - Lovely Atmosphere,,,,,,
,962,Good,,,,,,
,965,Thoroughly Enjoyed The Stay. The Hotel Is Old But With A Modern Decor Which Gives It A Very Classy Feel. The Food Was Excellent  So Was The Gin Bar. The Staff Are Attentive  Finding Just The Right Level Without Being Annoying And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. The Lack Of Hotel Parking Was The Only Thing I Feel Should Be Improved. In Summary  We Had A Great Time And Would Definitely Go Back  Taking Friends With Us Too. ,,,,,,
,966,Very Enjoyable  Excellent Service. ,,,,,,
,967,We Booked A Tasting Break Package And Received A Complimentary Upgrade To A Suite. Excellent Value For Money At £149.00 For Two.  Friendly Check In From Jessica.  Suite Was Spacious  The Bed Comfortable And The Bathroom Also Good.  However We Felt That The Interior Decor Was Not Quite Right And Several Items Were More Shabby Than Chic (Particularly The Bedside Tables)  Some Lapses In Housekeeping With Sticky Glass Surfaces And Dust On Lamps And Carved Screen Behind Bed.  Dinner Was Mostly Enjoyed  But As The Dining Room Was So Quiet We Did Not Want To Linger....... Breakfast Good According To My Husband.  Efficient Check Out..   ,,,,,,
,968,Indulgent,,,,,,
