,2,Excellent. All The Efforts Of The Staff Were Much Appreciated.,,,,,,
,4,Easy Check-In  Friendly And Professional Staff. Special Thanks To Jessica  Who Was Very Wonderful.,,,,,,
,7,Very Pleasant And Helpful Both Before And During Our Stay,,,,,,
,12,All Very Friendly And Professional.,,,,,,
,18,All Was Good And Very Efficient,,,,,,
,22,Having Stayed Back In February Which We Thoroughly Enjoyed We Took Advantage Of A Emailed Special Offer. The Whole Experience Was Superb And The Food Was Amazing. Thank You So Much  We Hope To Come Again.  Mike Authers,,,,,,
,24,Even The Dog Thought It Was A Lovely Hotel,,,,,,
,27,Reception Was Organised And Efficient  But Not Necessarily Warm And Friendly,,,,,,
,28,I Had To Try Several Calls To Book The Private Dining Room  On Arrival Staff Had Differing Views On When We Could Use The Room. The Court Yard Needed Housekeeping Before Opening To Guests. Ordering Wine  Mineral Water And Requesting Menus  Came Slowly And Individually  At These Prices Service Needs To Be More Professional.,,,,,,
,32,Many Thanks For Uograding Us To A Suite Because It Was A Special Occasion  Much Apprecited.  We Will Certainly Return In The Furture.  The Bathroom Toilet Was Not Clean When We Arrived But As Soon As I Brought It To Receptionists Attention It Was Cleaned Right Away.,,,,,,
,36,The Waitress Who Served Us Our Evening Meal Was Unfriendly And Almost Rude. She Served Us Again The Following Day For Breakfast And Was Equally Grumpy Then. We Were Not The Only People Who Experienced Her Bad Mood! Also  The Toilet In Our Suite Smelt Quite Badly If Urine. We Mentioned It To Reception Who Assured Someone Would Come And Give The Loo A Clean But This Never Materialised  Consequently We Our Room Smelled Quite Strongly Of A Men's Urinal.,,,,,,
,42,It Was Not Clear From The Booking Website That There Was A Reduction For Single Occupancy.,,,,,,
,45,Hmm. You Kept Sending Me E-Mails Asking About My Experience Before I Had Actually Stayed!! No Big Deal Though.,,,,,,
,46,Because Of Our Age We Endeavour To Avoid Hotels That Do Not Provide An Elevator If Our Accommodation Is Upstairs.  We Failed To Check Whether This Was The Case.  However In The Instance Of Our Stay Your Receptionist Insisted That We Leave Our Suitcases In The Foyer And A Staff Member Delivered Them To Our Room For Which We Were Most Grateful.,,,,,,
,49,Resturant Staff Very Surly Especially The Breakfast 'Manager',,,,,,
,51,No Problems With Reception Staff,,,,,,
,53,My Reservation Was For 2 X Twin Rooms  I Cancelled One 4 Days Prior To Arrival  Upon Arrival I Was Shown To 1 X Double Room ( Reservation Was For A Group Of Ladies). We Were Offered Two Separate Rooms Albeit At Opposite End Of The Hotel  Also We Were Only Notified The Day Before Of The Woodstock Fair Causing A Problem With Parking And Horrendous Noise Outside The Hotel - I Would Not Have Booked If I Had Been Told Earlier.  I Have Stayed Many Times Whilst Travelling On Business And Always Considered The Feathers A Super Hotel  However After This Visit I Am Most Disappointed.,,,,,,
,54,Spanish Receptionist Was Rude On Arrival (Speaking In Spanish) Which We Understood! A Shame As All Other Staff Fantastic,,,,,,
,56,Full Information About The Booking Was Provided To Us Via Email.,,,,,,
,67,Superb  Faultless  Beautiful.,,,,,,
,70,Pre-Arrival Telephone Call Was Very Good - Which Is Why We Were Quite Disappointed When We Actually Arrived - The Staff Were Not Rude But Just Not Welcoming,,,,,,
,72,Very Good Pre Arrival Contact Friendly And Welcoming Receptionist,,,,,,
,73,Our Booking By Sally (May Have Got Name Wrong) Was Handled Brilliantly - She Was Very Helpful. Check In Was Swift And The Offer Of A Cuppa Alovely Touch.,,,,,,
,76,Very Helpful Receptionist Upon Arriving.  Helped Me Up To My Room With My Many Bags  Spoke To The Kitchen And Arranged For Me To Have Dinner In My Room.,,,,,,
,79,There Was No One At The Desk When We First Walked In,,,,,,
,80,A Little Confusing About Parking  But We Live In Bristol  Park For 5 Seconds And You're Charged,,,,,,
,81,Straightforward And Professional,,,,,,
,82,We Were Shown To Our Room And Offered Tea/Coffee  However It Would Have Been Nice To Know That This Was Complimentary. It Would Also Have Been Nice To Know That The Water In The Rooms Was Complimentary.,,,,,,
,83,We Were Offered Tea/Coffee On Arrival To Our Room  However It Would Have Been Nice To Know That This Was Complimentary. Also A Note By The Water To Say That This Was Also Complimentary.,,,,,,
,86,It Would Have Been Nice To Sit By A Fire And Enjoy Our Coffee - But The Only Fire Was In The Reception By The Draughty Door - The 'Snug' Has No Fire And Is Effectively A Corridor To The Rooms.  We Were Surprised There Was No Cosy Lounge.,,,,,,
,94,Service Throughout Was Excellent,,,,,,
,98,Something I Know You Have No Control Over  But Car Parking Would Be Wonderful.,,,,,,
,99,Fantastic!!!,,,,,,
,100,Organised Everything Through Emily. She Was Very Helpful,,,,,,
,104,Unfortunately The Person I Spoke To On The Phone When Booking Our Dinner For 3 Nights Booked The Time Requested (7.30Pm) For One Night Only. Not A Major Problem  But We Had Guests Travelling From Far Away And Couldn't Eat Until 8.30Pm One Night.,,,,,,
,110,Person Greeting Us Was Not Particularly Interested. It Was Almost As Though We Were Disturbing Him !,,,,,,
,111,Excellent Staff,,,,,,
,113,Very Helpful Regarding Parking And Mobility Issues,,,,,,
,125,My Husband Arrived Ahead Of Me And Was Given A Tour And Really Felt This Was A Good Way To Start The Stay. Parking Was Easy Which Really Helped And The Team Put Our Minds At Rest That We Had Parked Correctly.,,,,,,
,136,Arrival Very Slick  Liked Being Escorted To My Room Straight Away,,,,,,
,139,After Telephone Booking I Received A Very Detailed Confirmation Email From The Hotel. On Arrival Was Told That We Had Been Upgraded From A Classic Double To A Superior Double. Considering We Were Already On A Special Package This Was Appreciated. We Were Then Provided With Complimentary Coffees.,,,,,,
,143,Receptionist Helpful And Carried Our Cases To The Room. No One Explained Where There Were Places To Sit And Have A Cup Of Tea And In The End We Were Put In The Dining Room When We Would Have Preferred A Lounge Situation At 4 Pm. We Were Happy To Stay At The Dinner Table After Our Excellent Meal  But There Was Nowhere Else For 6 Of Us To Go As The Only Small Sitting Room We Found Was Reserved For Another Party To Use After Dinner. Staff Helpful About A Birthday Cake And Storing It Until We Left Next Morning.,,,,,,
,147,When I Telephoned To Make A Reservation A Few Days Prior To Travel I Was Quoted An Extremely High Room Rate.I Expressed My Disappointment And Stated That Laterooms Was Advertising A Much Lower Rate And Very Quickly I Was Told That The Hotel Would Match The Rate.I Was Disappointed That I Hadn't Been Offered A More Competitive Quote In The First Instance. On Arrival At Hotel No One Was On Reception And We Had To Wait Several Minutes.However The Receptionist Was Welcoming And Apologised For The Delay.,,,,,,
,151,2 Negatives The First And Most Important Was The Unhealthy Environment Of Room 14. Not A Particularly Attractive Room But The Major Problem Was The Room Temperature Which Must Have Been 40O Plus At 5Pm The Room Is Secondary Glazed And It Was Only Possible To Open A Portion Of The Windows  30 Minutes After Opening These The Room Temperature Was Still Above 35O The Receptionist. Was Very Helpful And We Were Able To Relocate To A Room With Normal Temperatures Lastly We Booked The Room 4 Weeks Prior To Our Arrival On Sunday  Nobody Told Us At The Time Of Booking Or At Any Time Before Our Arrival That Use To The Street Fair We Would Be Unable To Park Anywhere Near The Hotel  This Was A Serious Problem As We Had Several Bags And Clothes Which Had To Be Manhandled . The Feathers Must Have Been Aware Of This But Decided To Keep Us In Ignorance,,,,,,
,155,Always Polite And Professional Yet Informal/Casual. Hard Combination To Get Right!! Made To Feel Very Welcome. Kind Of The Receptionist To Point Out The Travelzoo Offer When Booking Afternoon Tea And Interested In Overnight Stay.,,,,,,
,158,Very Welcoming. Lovely Cup Of Coffee.,,,,,,
,164,See Email Sent To Pride Of Britain,,,,,,
,165,See Email To Pride Of Britain,,,,,,
,166,The Whole Experience Was Really Good,,,,,,
,171,Every Staff Member We Had Contact With At The Feathers Was Courteous And Helpful During The Arrangements Before Our Wedding And On The Day And The Following Morning,,,,,,
,178,No,,,,,,
,179,All The Staff Were Very Friendly And Extremely Welcoming,,,,,,
,180,Thank You Peter For A Very Warm  Professional And Engaging Welcome At The Feathers. Our Delegates (International Hospitality And Tourism Educators) Were Very Impressed With You And Your Work So Far.  From A Professional Point Of View Everything Was Spot On With The Exception Of The Tables Outside Which Were Quite Dirty (Stains  Un-Emptied Ashtrays Etc).   ,,,,,,
,181,Really Enjoyed Our Stay  Staff Were All Lovely  Receptionist On Arrival Went Out Of Her Way To Ensure That We Had The 'Quiet' Room That I Had Requested.  I Was Then So Impressed With Suite 5 That We Choose It Even Though It Was On The Road And Not That Quiet!  It Didn't Detract From Our Overall Enjoyment.  The Food Was First Class.  Must Get On Trip Advisor And Leave The Feedback You Deserve.  Should I Have To Find A Negative It Would Be That The Shower Head In Suite 5 Was Awful!  Overall A Definite 10 Out Of 10,,,,,,
,186,We Were Running Late But We Were Welcomed & Reassured The Restaurant Would Informed & Ready For Us.,,,,,,
,189,Unable To Find A Parking Space,,,,,,
,193,Initial Booking Was Great.  A Problem With Your It System Meant I Received Two 'How Was Your Stay?' Emails Before We'd Even Arrived!  Our Check In Was Interrupted By Some Restaurant Guests Wanting To Settle Their Bill  But Otherwise Went Smoothly.,,,,,,
,194,We Had A Fantastic Experience Staying At Your Hotel  From The Upgraded Room And Rose Petals To The Delicious Gin Tasting Session.  Thank You So Much!,,,,,,
,195,We Were Able To Take Our Dog Who Was Made Very Welcome.,,,,,,
,196,As Stated We Have Not Been Yet  Coming In September.... The Drinks Are On You!!!!!!,,,,,,
,197,Hotel Room And Communal Parts  Far Too Hot,,,,,,
,198,We Did Struggle To Find Somewhere To Park But Obviously This Isn't Your Fault!,,,,,,
,199,I Phoned To Book A Table For Dinner Then Received An Email A Week Later Asking If I Would Like To Make A Dinner Reservation.,,,,,,
,200,Great Gin ,,,,,,
,202,Friendly Is Good  Welcoming Is Great  But Don't Overwhelm Me. It Should Feel Like Coming Home - If A Little Bit Cooler  Chicer And Definitely Tidier!,,,,,,
,205,Staff Very Helpfull And Welcoming,,,,,,
,207,We Were Surprised That We Had Not Been Told Our Room Would Be On The Third Floor And That It Was Not Suitable For The Elderly Or Those With Mobility Problems.,,,,,,
,214,Was Contacted 4 Times Asking For My Credit Card Number  Number Given Each Time.  Filled In Form On Arrival With Card Details Given.  On Leaving Asked Again As The Incorrect Number Was On The Your Form,,,,,,
,215,Although Busy The Receptionist Was Really Helpful,,,,,,
,217,Staff Very Welcoming  Easy Check In,,,,,,
,225,We Have Already Done A Similar Crit On The Otel  It Was Absolutely Terrfic  Food Good  Staff Good Only Problem (For Us) Was The Room  Being Up At Top Of The Building,,,,,,
,226,Best Stay We Have Ever Had  Staff Excellent And Even Called Evening Prior To Ensure We Were Still On Track To Arrive That Evening - Will Be Visiting Again!  Many Thanks,,,,,,
,233,Excellent Service ..,,,,,,
,234,My Wife And I Cannot Speak Highly Enough Of The Wonderful Stay We Had At The Feathers.We Were Celebrating My Wife's Birthday And The Staff Could Not Have Made Us More Welcome.The Meal In The Restaurant On The Saturday Evening Was As Good As Anything We Had Experienced Anywhere And The Service Was Exemplory.Please Thank Everyone For A Delightful Stay. Regards Malcolm And Margaret Evans,,,,,,
,235,Liked The Fact That The Gentleman On Reception Took The Time To Show Us Around The Hotel Before Taking Us To Our Room.,,,,,,
,238,All Staff Were Very Welcoming And Professional. The Decor Is Wonderfully Individual Both In The Room And In The Hotel. It Was A Delightful Stay And We Look Forward To Visiting Again.,,,,,,
,242,It Was Odd To Receive A Request For Comments On My Stay Before It Had Taken Place!,,,,,,
,244,I Booked Four Rooms For My Family.  My Mother Was Upset That Her Room Smelt Musty On Arrival And Had To Ask For The Room To Be Aired.  Your Staff  Of Course  Did This But Unfortunately The Inital 'Wow Factor' Was Tainted For My Parents.,,,,,,
,245,I Personally Would Have Preferred Tea Making Facilities In The Bedroom - Although It Was Offered On Arrival And Told Could Request - For That Early Morning Cup Of Tea Much Easier To Make Yourself Especially If Other Person Is Asleep And You Don't Want Them Disturbed By Someone Bringing Tea Up To The Room.,,,,,,
,252,Excellent Stay And Great Service,,,,,,
,253,I Was Told That Parking Was Available Outside The Hotel. My Daughter And I Spent Half And Hour Looking For A Parking Space. Although He Was Offered Help With The Cases My Husband Did It Himself And Fell Up The Stairs. Please Ignore Elderly People Who May Have Difficulties With The Steps. Our Room Was Not A Twin And We Were Moved. I Think You Should Be Advised That The First Room Key Also Fitted The Room Next Door.,,,,,,
,254,Even Although My Husband Said He Would Take The Cases Up Himself I Am Afraid The Stairs Are Not Conducive For An Elderly Man To Navigate With Luggage As He Fell Up The Stairs When I Came In It Was Only To Find That The Key To Our Room Also Fitted The Other Room Next Door 23/24 And That Our Room Was Not As We Required.  It Was A Double Rather Than A Twin. Also My Daughter Found The Room 14 Extremely Cold And Had Go Ask For An Extra Blanket. She Was Still Cold.,,,,,,
,263,We Were Disappointed That The Gourmet Sunday That We Had Booked Was Withdrawn.  We Were More Disappointed That You Did Not Contact Us About This  We Only Found Out From Subsequent Viewing Of Your Web Page.  We Had To Ask Rather Than Be Told By You. We Have Also Been Confused To Receive 2 Feedback Requests Before Even Staying With You.,,,,,,
,264,Very Helpful In Respect Of My Wife's 'Diet' (Not A Meat-Eater  And Doesn't Like Garlic!),,,,,,
,268,Ipod Dock On Bedside Table Did Not Work. Not Important To Us But Thought We Would Mention It.,,,,,,
,269,Staff In Reception Were Very Helpful And Informative.,,,,,,
,270,Receptionist Very Helpful In Carrying Bag To The Very Top Room.  Little Useful Information Provided  Eg. On Street Car Parking Restrictions Or Not.  It Would Be Helpful To Have Set Out Clearly Exactly What Our 3 Day Package Comprised As It Was Never Clear From Website And No Information Given Upon Arrival,,,,,,
,277,All Staff On Contact And Arrival Very Helpful And Friendly.,,,,,,
,280,All Was Very Good,,,,,,
,286,The Only Disappointment Was Having To Ask To Have My Bottle Of White Wine  Ordered With My Evening Meal  Placed In An Ice Bucket After It Had Been Left On The Table For Over Half An Hour. All Other Guests Had Their Wines In Ice Buckets. Also My Husband And I Had Empty Glasses From Our Pre Dinner Drinks Left On The Table And Again I Had To Ask To Have Them Removed As The Main Course Was Served. Small Points But They Are The Reason Why I Haven't Selected 'Strongly Agree' Above.,,,,,,
,287,A Surprise Celebration Weekend Was Ruined To Many Things To Say But Will Be Talking With The Manager When He Returns From Honeymoon !,,,,,,
,289,I Did Mention That My Husband Had Mobility Problems And Used Sticks.  Pre-Arrival I Was Told That There Was No Lift But We Would Be Accommodated On As Low A Floor As Possible.  However  Our Room Was On The 4Th Floor With A Number Of Stairs To Reach It.  But We Coped And It Did Not Affect The Enjoyment Of Our Stay.  We Are Thinking Of Visiting Again With A Friend With More Severe Mobility Problems (Although Not Wheelchair Bound) And Wonder How She Would Be Accommodated.,,,,,,
,291,The Welcome  The Room  The Food Were All Excellent,,,,,,
,294,Noisy,,,,,,
,295,Hotel Manager Was Very Keen To Help Us With Bags Etc - Especially As The Room Was Difficult To Access With Suitcases!,,,,,,
,302,We Were Both A Bit Disappointed With Our 'Dog Friendly' Room Because It Wasn't As Nice As The Photos On Your Web Site.  We Know That We Had A Good Deal Price Wise But The Room Was Quite Small And Rather Tired And Dark.,,,,,,
,303,Other Than The Fire?,,,,,,
,309,The Room Was Very Hot,,,,,,
,310,No.,,,,,,
,312,Website Had Promised Jelly Beans In The Room...Had Just Told Husband Before We Got To The Room  But No Jelly Beans! Website Should Be Changed  Bit Disappointed (Although Not Massively!).,,,,,,
,313,The Girl On Reception Did Her Job Well. Waiters I Think Came From Falti Towers.,,,,,,
,316,I Experienced Difficulty In Parking Which Took Me Almost An Hour Driving Around Woodstock Before  Finding A Place To Park.  However The Staff Were Sincerely Apologetic And Understanding And Did Their Utmost To Make Sure That Our Stay Was As Comfortable And Enjoyable As Possible  The Hotel Manager And Reception Staff Were Superb Both In Their Warmth And Professional Manner.,,,,,,
,317,Rosie And Warren Great Over Email. Reception Who Welcomed Us On Arrival Was Great Too. All Waiting Staff Were Very Friendly And Informative,,,,,,
,327,We Will Complete Survey After Our Visit In August,,,,,,
,328,This Was Our Second Visit - We Came For The First Time In October - And We Just Love The Feathers And Everything About You,,,,,,
,332,Very Welcoming,,,,,,
,335,The Promotional Offer We Purchased Included Supper And Breakfast  Whilst This Was A Very Good Value For Money Opportunity The Explanation Via The Website Of The  5 Course Dinner Was Insufficient. It Was Not Made Clear That The Menu Was A 'Fixed Menu' Option. However  This Was Delicious And We Are Not Complaining! Just A Thought From A Marketing Perspective  A 5 Course Supper Is Not Everyone's Ideal  An Alternative Choice Option  Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,,
,338,Difficult Car-Parking,,,,,,
,340,I Called Ahead To Advise My Husband Was Lactose Intolerant And This Was Confirmed Prior To Arrival And Made The Stress Of Making Sure Everything Went Smoothly,,,,,,
,342,Fantastic Artistic And Ready To Appeal To Every Different Type Of Person Thankyou,,,,,,
,343,Fantastic,,,,,,
,348,Offering To Carry Bags Is A Nice Touch,,,,,,
,349,The Receptionist Was Very Helpful When She Realised My Husband Was Disabled She Went Out Of Her Way To Accommodate All Our Needs,,,,,,
,352,Was Quoted A Price Then Phoned To Confirm The Next Day The Prices Had Gone Up!  Nearly Walked Away At That Point.,,,,,,
,353,Warren Was A Bit Stroppy On The Phone When I Asked If That Was The Best Price He Could Do After Being Quoted A Much Better Price A Few Days Before.,,,,,,
,354,Excellent Welcome On Arrival And Upgraded When Asked.,,,,,,
,364,You Need To Offer An In House Pressing Service.,,,,,,
,371,We Tried To Book With Your Website But Nothing Available. When We Tried Through Late Rooms We Got A Room. Didn't Really Understand That. Maybe We Should Have Rung Direct. Will Definitely Stay Again.,,,,,,
,376,No Mention Of Specal Offers Given When We Booked With A Voucher And My Daughter Was Assured Such Would Be Available When We Booked With The Voucher . I Noticed That Dinner B&B Winter Break Was Advertised Outside Your Hotel And We Were Not Offered This Rate !?,,,,,,
,377,Welcoming Staff,,,,,,
,380,Shown To  And Around The Room. Nice Touch,,,,,,
,383,My Wife And Did Not Like The First Room Offered To Us It Was Ground Level In The Court Yard Very Dark Etc. Struck Me As Being A Room For A Visitor With Disabilities. We Were Then Shown The Red Kite Room Which Was Fine.,,,,,,
,386,Checking In Was A Bit Slow,,,,,,
,389,Lovely Hotel But We Stayed In Room 29 Mallard  The Room Had A Very Strange Noise Which Went On Into The Early Hours And Started Again At 6Am So Not A Good Night's Sleep - We Did Report It To Reception And Recorded The Noise  But Nothing Happened About It Or Any Explanation Given. Also Service In Restaurant Was Very Slow And Wrong Wine Was Served And We Had A Complain Three Times Before It Was Changed  Another Customer Had The Same Problem. Kind Of Took The Edge Off The Stay  However Woodstock Is A Lovely Place And We Would Consider Staying Again. ,,,,,,
,390,Lovely Food  Wine And Comfy Bed.,,,,,,
,391,Very Welcoming And Everything Straightforward And No Major Issues When Checking In Which Is A Massive Plus!!,,,,,,
,395,No Tea Or Coffee Making Facilities In The Rooms!,,,,,,
,402,Very Efficient Staff.,,,,,,
,414,Rosie And Warren Were Both Very Helpful And Fast At Answering My Questions Via Email,,,,,,
,415,I Found All The Staff To Be Very Warm  Efficient And Friendly. However  I Felt That Some May Find The Service Too 'Casual' If They Are Accustomed To The Standard Hotel Service In Big Cities (I Personally Found It Appropriate). Your Website And Its Overuse Of Pink Makes Some People Avoid Staying At The Hotel  I Feel. It Certainly Made Me Worry About My Decision To Stay And I Did Witness Certain 'Differences' In Our Taste In Varioys Areas Of The Room And Offer Facilities.,,,,,,
,418,The Receptionist Seemed Rather New In Her Job And Hence Not As Able To Answer Queries Quite As Readily As We Might Have Expected.  However  She Was Very Pleasant And Tried Her Best To Assist.,,,,,,
,420,Rosie Was Very Helpful In Sorting Out Several Queries And The Booking Itself. Upon Arrival The Gentleman On The Front Desk Was Polite And Chatty. It's A Great Place!,,,,,,
,424,The Stay Was Good But The Taster Menu Was Too Small. We Had To Go For A Meal Straight After As Were Were Still Hungry. This Was A Big Let Down For Us.,,,,,,
,425,Hotel Lacked Wi- Fi Access In Our Room And Only Had It In Very Specific Locations Such As Sofa At Bar.,,,,,,
,426,We Look Forward To Our Visit. Send The Questionnaire After We Leave.,,,,,,
,428,Pre Arrival Info & Comunication Excellent - Emily I Think . Arrival Poor - Other Than Being Shown To Our Room And Gven The Pink Leaflet Nothing Was Said.,,,,,,
,429,Pre-Arrival Emails - Excellent.  Very Impressed.  Greeting Upon Arrival Very Friendly.  Food Excellent. Rest Was Poor.  Customer Service Was Appalling.  Room Was Noisy And Outside Of Main Hotel Which We Weren't Expecting.  Stair Case Next To Our Room - Where The Head Of The Bed Was And Rooms Above - Noisy.  Upstairs Guests Going In And Out  Staff Delivering Newspapers  And Later On Room Services (Between 7.15-8Am) Really Noisy So Hardly Restful.  Friday - 40 Minutes Of Sitting In Study Before Being Acknowledged Despite 3 Staff Walking Past And Another Couple Actually Being Served Coffee Right Next To Us. Eventually Asked If We Would Like Refreshments By A Different Staff Member - Afternoon Tea Was Very Nice And The Waiter Very Friendly.  When Arriving For Breakfast  I Asked The Receptionist (Male) If We Should Wait Before Entering The Restaurant Or Go Straight In  He Didnt Respond And Continued To View His Pc.  We Went In.  Breakfast - No Tables Available When We Arrived At Approx 9.45Am  All Were Dirty. No Staff Around. So We Stood And Waited.  Table Was Laid Up For Us.  Breakfast Was Very Nice.  We Had Supper In The Hotel On Saturday Night And The Food Was Excellent.  Breakfast On Sunday  Repeat Of Previous Day Only Worse.  No Tea  Coffee  Juices Offered.  No Cereals Bowls.  We Weren't The Last To Arrive So Others Would Have Found The Same Issues. Seemed Surprised That Guests Would Actually Appear For Breakfast!  When Attempting To Check Out  We Had To Find The Staff As There Was No Receptionist.  When A Staff Member Was Found  They Had To Find Someone To Check Us Out.  15 Minutes Later We Managed To Leave.  So  No  We Wouldn't Return.  We Stayed In The Lords Last Year And  Although We Didnt Expect The Same  The Difference Is Quite Amazing.   Your Reputation Brings Guests  Your Customer Service I Think  Will Ensure They Dont Return.  Sorry.  ,,,,,,
,430,Friendly And Unfussy But Warm,,,,,,
,437,Loved My Stay - Slight Suggestion Would Be To Have A Gin Cocktails List As With The Array You Have Would Be A Nice Way Of Complimenting This As Opposed To Just A Normal Cocktail List.  Certainly Will Be Staying Again In The Future.,,,,,,
,441,All Staff Were Extremely Helpful Before And During Our Stay,,,,,,
,442,None At All  Very Pleasing.,,,,,,
,443,I Think The Hotel Is Lovely. We Travel A Lot With Work So We Do Have High Standards. I Think The Staff Let You Down Though. You Do Need Someone At The Bar At All Times. We Witnessed 2 Guests Calling One Of Your Staff Rude  But She Was Great With Us. The Hotel Really Lacks Atmosphere - There Is No Buzz And I Think That Comes Down To Your Staff  Lots Of Smiles  Chatting To Customers. I See That This Is A Constant Them On Review Sites. Rosie Was Very Good Upon Arrival  Everyone Was Cordial But You Need That Extra 'Zing'. By The Way  Great Food In The Restaurant But The Breakfast The Next Day Wasnt So Great. Continental Breakfast Choice Was Really Poor And Service Was A Let Down. The English Breakfast Was Great Though. Just Little Niggles  And If These Are Sorted Out  It Would Be A Buzzing Little Venue. By The Way - Will You Put Tea And Coffee Makers In The Rooms? Makes Such A Difference. Many Thanks,,,,,,
,450,I Am Vegetarian And The Man Who Took Our Bookings Asked Upfront About Dietary Requirements. I Was Really Impressed With That.,,,,,,
,452,All Contact Was Very Pleasant,,,,,,
,453,Our Stay Coincided With A Wedding Party And The Bar Area Was Unavailable,,,,,,
,455,Should Be Advised Of Difficulty In Getting Up Stairs,,,,,,
,459,The Gentleman Who Booked Us In Was Very Welcoming  Professional And Friendly,,,,,,
,461,The Gentleman At Reception Was Amazing Really Warm And Welcoming But Very Professional At The Same Time,,,,,,
,464,Pre-Arrival Contact: I Did Find Pre-Ordering Of Dinner To Be Very Time-Consuming And This Would Put Me Off Bringing A Large Group For Dinner Again,,,,,,
,476,All Excellent,,,,,,
,477,Very Pleasant Receptionist -Emily,,,,,,
,478,No,,,,,,
,483,It Was Better Than The Dorchester In London....,,,,,,
,488,A Bit Chaotic On Arrival. But We Had A Lot Of Luggage And The Reception Area Is Cramped. The Porters Were Exceptionally Helpful.,,,,,,
,489,Person I Spoke To On The Phone During Initial Booking Was Very Helpful And Friendly,,,,,,
,493,The Staff Are Unusually Friendly And Helpful. It Is Rare To Get This Level Of Professionalism In The Uk,,,,,,
,494,Booking Our Stay Was Very Easy And So Nice To Get Personal Responses To Emails And Promptly Too. Rosie In Particular. Queries Dealt With By Whoever Picked Up The Phone - No Transferring Between Departments Or Difficulties Because Calling Outside Office Hours. So Nice To Arrive And Not To Have To Go Through Any Lengthy Checking In Process - Were Just Taken Straight To Our Room.,,,,,,
,506,Only Negative Thing I Can Say Is To Suggest Is That Your Evening Dinner Menu In The Restaurant Appeal To A Wider Market. The Food Is A Work Of Art And It Is Clear That Your Chef Takes Pride In His Work But Some People Would Just Like A More Simple Fillet Of Beef And/Or Chicken Dish. We Stayed Recently For A Wedding Anniversary And Dined In The Restaurant But The Evening Didn't Go To Plan As There Were No Dishes That Appealed To Me So I Had To Ask For The Beef Dish To Be Cooked Differently And I Made It Clear That I Did Not Like Rare Beef. When My Meal Came It Was Pink And Rare So I Had To Send It Back. By The Time My Meal Came Back My Husband Had Finished His Dinner So We Did Not Get To Dine Together. The Restaurant Manager Dealt With This Situation In An Excellent Manner But It Could Have Been Avoided If There Were Just A Couple Of 'Simpler' Dishes On The Menu.,,,,,,
,509,No Comments As I Have Not Stayed.,,,,,,
,510,Room Was Ready Early Which Was Excellent. Also Your Check Out Time Of 1130 Is Fantastic. Means No Pressure.,,,,,,
,517,Telephoned Far Too Late To Be Informed That Kitchen Was Closed,,,,,,
,521,We Would Have Appreciated Warning That Our Room Was Up Three Flights Of Steepish Stairs. I Am A Reasonably Fit 83 But Found The Stairs A Struggle,,,,,,
,524,Very Prompt Reply Via Email When We Had Some Queries. Staff Very Polite Throughout Stay.,,,,,,
,532,The Young Lady On The Door  Im Sorry I Didnt Catch Her Name  Was Very Welcoming,,,,,,
,536,Poor Reception Staff At Checkout.,,,,,,
,540,Very Nice And Helpful Staff.  Wifi Very Weak. Had To Go To Another Location To Connect.,,,,,,
,543,Jessica Very Helpfull,,,,,,
,545,No Email Confirmation Of Dinner Booking Time As Requested But It Was Correct When We Arrived,,,,,,
,551,Excellent Service Throughout. I Was Booking A Group Stay For 4 Rooms/8 People For My Sister's 40Th Birthday.,,,,,,
,553,Every Member Of Staff Were Warm And Friendly. It Is Always Service With A Smile And A Chat.,,,,,,
,557,Daina (I Think That Was Her Name) Was Very Pleasant And Helpful ,,,,,,
,558,Just Thought The Carpet In The Restaurant A Little Loud And The Ornaments On The Shelves A Little Odd And Crowded.  Loved The Courtyard  The Food Etc...,,,,,,
,567,Reception Girls On Our Arrival Very Pleasant But Not Fully Conversant,,,,,,
,572,Room Was On The Top Floor Of The Adjoining House With Lots Of Stairs  Not A Problem For Us But Could Have Been And Maybe Worth Exploring/ Mentioning When Booking,,,,,,
,578,Very Friendly And Efficient,,,,,,
,581,Friendly Staff..,,,,,,
,582,We Had Asked For A Taxi To Be Booked To Take Us From The Station  And Despite Having This Confirmed By Email  No Taxi Was Booked And We Had To Wait At The Station For 20 Minutes Until A Replacement Could Be Ordered.,,,,,,
,584,Tried To Book On The Website Twice So Had To Phone In The End And Could Not Get The Date I Wanted,,,,,,
,585,Receptionist Was Extremely Helpful,,,,,,
,588,The Receptionist/Concierge On Duty On The 25Th And 26Th Was Unfailingly Courteous  Helpful And Welcoming - A Real Pro. She Had Arranged For Us To Have A Dog-Friendly Room Which Turned Out To Be Perfect.,,,,,,
,592,Everything Was Professionally Handled.,,,,,,
,599,The Lady That Booked Us In Was Very Polite But Did Not Seem To Know About The 4 Steps To Woodstock Which Included Afternoon Tea And Had To Check. I Showed Her My Email To Confrim This.  Only A Small Comment And It Did Not Spoil Anything.,,,,,,
,603,Bathroom -Only One Hook For Clothes; No Soap Dish ; Poor Light For Shaving With Only One Big Mirror,,,,,,
,609,All The Staff Were Very Helpful And Friendly,,,,,,
,611,Without Air Conditioning  It Was A Bit Warm For Our Taste (Being American)  But Was Still Lovely Overall.  The Only Issue We Had (Out Of Your Control) Was Contending With The Rowdy Bar Crowd Outside The Establishment Across The Street From Our Room  Since We Needed To Keep The Windows Open For The Cool Breeze. (Suite 5).,,,,,,
,613,No,,,,,,
,617,Peter Saunders Greeted Us Enthusiastically And Anticipated Our Every Need...And There Were Many Of Them.Returning Our Rental Car To Oxford  Figuring Out The Best Travel Option To Edinburgh  Bus Directions  Taxi Arrangements  Where To Eat  Etc. He Was Always Gracious  Never Lost Patience. We Loved Our Stay At Feathers And Peter Made Our Time There Very Special. We Would Recommend Feathers To Any Of Our Friends Visiting The Cotswolds. Warmly  Audrey And Harvey Scher,,,,,,
,618,Stairways Hard To Climb,,,,,,
,619,Being Shown To The Room Was Very Helpful,,,,,,
,620,None,,,,,,
,621,No,,,,,,
,628,Booking Was Very Easy And Prompt Confirmation,,,,,,
,632,2 Comments  1. I Booked Room 32 But Was Given Room 25 2. Ordered Extra Toast At Breakfast Which Never Arrived,,,,,,
,635,No Everything Was Fine As Always With 'The Feathers' Our Most Favourite Hotel!,,,,,,
,636,None,,,,,,
,644,Survey Loads So Slowly..Wasted 15 Mins So Far...Worst Part By Far!,,,,,,
,645,Parking Is The Only Drawback  Otherwise... Exceptional Service And Attention By Friendly Staff. Much Better Than Any Large Chain Of Hotels. Many Thanks.,,,,,,
,651,My Reservation Using Travelzoo Voucher Was Handled Well  Sometimes With Offers Such As This  When You Phone The Person Has No Knowledge Or Unsure What To Do  But Very Well Handled With Quick Follow Up E.Mail. On Arrival Check In And Short Tour A Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,652,Speed Of Email Query Return Was Good,,,,,,
,661,Very Friendly Receptionist (Morning Sunday 3 Nov).,,,,,,
,663,Excellent In Every Respect.,,,,,,
,668,The Room We Stayed In  Although Comfortable  Was Extremely Noisy. The Floor Upstairs Creaked And We Therefore Didn't Get Any Sleep.,,,,,,
,669,Very Friendly And Helpful But Initially Sent Wrong Details For Agreed Booking,,,,,,
,670,While The Reception/Restaurant Areas Were Very Pleasant  We Found The Colour Scheme Of The Room Rather Heavy And Dark.,,,,,,
,673,My Arrival And Pre Arrival Contact Was Really Stellar. Dana Was Amazing The Whole Way Through And Did An Amazing Pre Contact  Arranging So Many Things For Me And So Helpful. Also Jessica Helped Her  And Ana Was So Sweet And Helpful After My Arrival And During My Stay.,,,,,,
,677,Area Around Loo Smelled But Was Put Right Quickly,,,,,,
,678,My Partner Had A Specific Problem With Her Leg And Your Receptionist Was Extremely Helpful.,,,,,,
,680,Very Obliging Young Lady On Reception - Changed Our Room To Be On The Ground Floor To Help My Husband Who Is Having Difficulty With Stairs,,,,,,
,684,Poor Facilities-No Comfortable Lounge To Have Coffee And Meet Other Guests,,,,,,
,686,We Used A Travelzoo Voucher And We Were Very Impressed With The Way We Were Treated Just As Any Other Full Paying Guests...Brilliant.  Our Dog Was Taken Care Of In The Room With A Bed And A Bowl..Simple  But Effective! Ben Was Informative At Dinner And In The Gin Bar.  Lovely Place  Lovely Staff And Will Definately Recommend... Will Also Do A Tripadvisor For You.,,,,,,
,690,Very Good.,,,,,,
,692,I Was Disappointed That The Hotel Is Not Nearly As Attractive As It Was Several Years Ago When I Stayed.  At Least Window-Boxes On The Ground Floor And Something Around The Front Door Would Add To The Ambiance.  The Room  As Well  Could Be More Appealing Without The Ugly Blankets And Pink Clock That Was Incorrect.  Just By Adding More Attractive Features Would Improve Your Guests' Visits.  Don't Try To Be Modern Unless You Go All The Way.  Staff Was Very Pleasant  Including The Receptionist; However  She Must Learn To Multi-Task And Not Keep People Waiting For Long Periods Of Time While She Talks On The Phone Without Even Acknowledging Your Presence.  Normally I Do Not Submit Comments To Hotels  However  I Felt Let Down By The Changes Since By Last Visit  Admittedly Quite Some Time Ago.    Lenore E. Thornton,,,,,,
,696,The Response To The Chimney Fire Was Handled Well!,,,,,,
,698,When Initially Rang To Book The Wine And Dine Gourmet Evening I Was Told Sorry Fully Booked! I Queried This As I Had Rang Earlier And There Was A Few Rooms  The Chap I Spoke To Said Yes But The Restaurant Is Fully Booked!  This For Some Reason Didn't Ring True And I Was Correct As I Rang Back Later Still And Spoke To Rosie Who Said That Was Not The Case And So I Booked With Her. That Evening The Glass Shelf In En-Suite Fell Of Wall And Broke (Not Enough Screws Hokding It Up)  Door Handle Came Off When Member Of Staff First Took Us To Our Room And She Was Locked In With Us.  The Dinner Experience Was A Little Lacking In Atmosphere - Maybe Some Nice Background Music Would Add To This As Far Too Quiet.,,,,,,
,700,I Needed To Change The Reservation; The People I Spoke To Were Courteous And Efficient,,,,,,
,701,Great Staff And Very Relaxing Atmosphere.,,,,,,
,705,All My Contact Was Excellent,,,,,,
,706,A Drink On Arrival Would Be A Nice Touch,,,,,,
,707,Made To Feel Very Welcome,,,,,,
,710,I Called The Hotel To Book And No One Answered The Phone For Such A Long Time I Gave Up And Called The Next Day. Again There Was A Long Delay Before Someone Answered. On Arrival The Staff Were Very Welcoming And Efficient.,,,,,,
,719,Staff Were Very Helpful.,,,,,,
,723,The Is No Clear Pictures On The Website For The Room Types. I Was Disappointed With The Room And Bed We Had - Should There Have Been Pictures Or Better Room Descriptions On The Website - I Would Have Been Able To Choose Something More Suitable.,,,,,,
,724,Really Helpful Staff When I Contacted To Book. I Explained That My Uncle Had Problems With Steps Etc So A Ground Floor Room Was Provided Which Has Its Own Area To Sit Outside Which Was Ideal Considering The Weather. They Were Delighted With The Accomodation,,,,,,
,725,Thank You So Much For Making Our Stay Both Relaxing And Comfortable. The Room Was Great  Food Was Excellent And Pete And Jessica Were A Delight. Best Regards Matthew,,,,,,
,727,I Had Originally Called To Get Information On The Bistro Break Offer And Was Told There Was Plenty Of Availability On The Date That I Wanted.  Then When I Called Back To Book It (I Was Booking As A Surprise For My Boyfriends 40Th So Wanted To Check That I Could Get Him Off Work On The Monday Before Going Ahead With The Booking)  I Was Told That The Special Was No Longer Available Which I Was Very Disappointed About  However The Guy Who I Was Speaking To Was Kind Enough To Give Me The Deal And My Boyfriend Was Incredibly Happy With The Surprise.,,,,,,
,729,Fantastic Service,,,,,,
,735,This A Lovely Hotel  In A Beautiful Location. The Food Is Great.  The Style  Design And Facilities Are Very Good.  But What Lets This Place Down Is The Staff And The Administration. Whilst Everyone Is Friendly And Pleasant  No One Is Efficient  Professional Or Knowledgeable.,,,,,,
,742,No.,,,,,,
,743,I Asked Twice For A Letter/Email Of Confirmation But Did Not Receive One. Also  Curiously  I Was Reminded In Two Seperate Telephone Calls That My Daughter And I Could Actually Have Twin Beds Rather Than A Double Bed  As If I Was Completely Unaware Of That Possibility And Had Probably Just Landed From Another Planet. As I Was The  Customer They Should Have Realised That It Was Up To Me To Decide. They Both Tried In Their Own Quiet Way To Change My Mind And I Still Don't Know Why-Slightly Worrying.,,,,,,
,744,I Do Not Remember Receiving A Confirmation Of Booking Email/Letter Although I Asked Twice.,,,,,,
,751,We Are English But Work In Usa  We Came Over For The Battle Of The Proms  We Had Been Touring Uk  For Our Holiday  We Had The Family Room 2  Would Have Appreciated A Fan For Cool Air Though   The Staff Was Not Particularly Friendly  I Asked Did The Room Have A Hair Dryer  The Receptionist Did Not Know And Did Not Even Know Where In The Room There Would Be One. Did Not Have A Good Welcome. The Bottles Of Water In The Room Were Warm And One Which Should Have Been Fizzy Was Warm And Still. The Steps In That Family Room Are Dangerous  Fell On The Floor Because I Forgot There Was Some Steps  The Bath Rail Should Have Not Been On  It Was A Very Hot South Facing Room!!!!!! But The Breakfast Was Great  The Bed Was Comfortable Apart From The Bed Settee. A Nice Courtyard  But Noisey Due To Guests  If Young Children We  Would Not Stay With Young Children  And The Noise From The Ventilation At The Fire Exit End Was Too Loud For My Son To Get Off To Sleep. The Wardrobe Door Needs A Fix As It Swings Open And Hits You In The Head  Maybe A Fan And  A Fridge For Cold Water And Do Something About Those Dangerous Steps From The Bathroom It Could Be A Good Room. Needs Some Blinds To Keep Out The Hot Mid Day Sun On All The Windows.   ,,,,,,
,752,Very Good - Re-Confirmed My Reservation.,,,,,,
,754,Everything Was Perfect. We Only Stayed One Night But We Loved Every Second. A Beautiful Hotel.,,,,,,
,759,Pre Arrival Contact Re:Evening Menu Over 2 Evenings. We Felt We Should Have Been Told That The Taster Menu Was Virtually Identical To The A La Carte   So Gave Us A Poor Choice . Pre Arrival Contact Re:Parking Was Casual And We Had To Clarify Further On Arrival.,,,,,,
,761,All Good...  Very Nice,,,,,,
,762,Ac Would Be Nice  But I Stayed During A Heatwave!,,,,,,
,763,Staff Were Excellent As Always.,,,,,,
,771,The Smoking Fire The Whole Weekend Was Not Good. Had Problems Over My Wife Being Veggie.  Mentioned On Booking  Was Told All Fine.  Then Confirmation Email Asked About Dietary Needs  So Had To Reconfirm.  Then Got Call Saying Gin Experience Menu Had To Be Veggie For Both Of Us  So I Said Fine.  Asked Again At Dinner Whether We Both Wanted Veggie; When I Said I Would Prefer Not  I Was Given Non- Veggie.  I Was A Bit Confused And My Wife A Bit Embarrassed By Difficulty Of It All.,,,,,,
,788,The Staff Who Took The Booking Were Really Helpful And Accommodating.  They Were Knowledgeable And Courteous.,,,,,,
,791,We Had To Climb Some Floors To Our Room But It Was Worth It. ,,,,,,
,795,Courtesy Call Pre Check In Was Good,,,,,,
,796,No,,,,,,
,797,See Previous Comments,,,,,,
,798,Parking Is A Bit Hard But Overall Your Establishment Is Wonderful. I Will Write In Trip Advisor As Well. We'll See You Next Year.,,,,,,
,801,Wonderful All Round.,,,,,,
,804,Very Quick Service.,,,,,,
,805,Very Straight Forward,,,,,,
,806,The Young Ladies On Reception Were Excellent  Most Welcoming.,,,,,,
,807,No,,,,,,
,814,No More Comments  Thank You.,,,,,,
,815,It Was Odd That The Gas Man / Meter Man Took Priority Over A Paying Guest - Just Walking In Off The Street And Pulling Off The Receptionist Whilst I And My Partner Were Waiting To Check Out - But Apart From That Everything Was Up To Standard And Professional And Welcoming  Thank You,,,,,,
,821,See Earlier Comments,,,,,,
,823,Very Helpful Booking Arrangement Jessica Arranged Vip Passes At Bicester ,,,,,,
,826,It Was Good To Have A Call Prior To Our Arrival As Our Booking Was Via Internet It Gave The Personal Touch,,,,,,
,828,When I Called To Make A Booking  They Said Reception Was Busy And Asked Me To Call Back - If This Was My Business  I Would Make Sure That Potential Guests Are Called Back.   You Could Have Lost The Business.,,,,,,
,829,No It Was Fine For What We Paid  I Would Have Been Disappointed With The Experience If I Had Paid More Than £500. ,,,,,,
,832,We Thought The Hotel Information Done As A Paper Was A Very Good Touch. ,,,,,,
,836,Very Nice Lady Who Showed Us To Our Room. Very Helpful,,,,,,
,838,Happy With Everything - Thank You!,,,,,,
,841,Very Helpful & Professional... Happy To Move One Of The Staff Cars On Arrival So I Could Park. Nice Touch ,,,,,,
,843,Very Helpful In Booking And Check In,,,,,,
,846,Everything Was Really Professional And Welcoming. The Lady On Reception Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,847,Telephone Contact Re . Booking Dealt With Very Well!,,,,,,
,848,Upon Arrival We Were Made To Feel Very Relaxed  And Was Shown To Our Room Very Promptly.,,,,,,
,851,No Problems At All Everytime We Have Been  ,,,,,,
,852,Very Efficiently Dealt With Although There Were Some Problems With The Computer We Were Quickly Given The Keys To Our Room And Luggage Was Carried Up For Us.,,,,,,
,853,We Liked Most Of The Decor  But Felt The Lounge Was A Bit Dour And Would Benefit From A Warmer Refurb.,,,,,,
,854,Contact Was Informative   Helpful And Friendly,,,,,,
,858, Lovely Lady Handled The Process; She Seemed To Have A Lot On Her Plate With Multiple Entries / Exits And Dining Room Queries,,,,,,
,862,We Were Asked If We Needed Help With Luggage . We Said No But 3 Flights Of Stairs Later We Wished We Had Said Yes. The Receptionist Who Showed Us The Room Mentioned It Was An Upgrade . Compared To Our Previous Stay It Was Fairly Basic . No Information Was Offered Such As Breakfast Times. The Room Contained No Folder Of Local Information Or Hotel Facilities  Apart From Fire Instructions,,,,,,
,863,Would Advise Guests About The Parking Situation Before Arrival,,,,,,
,868,Free Parking Right Outside Was Useful,,,,,,
,869,Since I Was Coordinating Our Trip From The States  I Was On Email With Your Front Office Team Consistently.  Very Responsive And Accommodating With Our Needs....I Needed A Ground Floor Room For My Mother In Law  For Example  And It Was All Perfect When We Arrived.,,,,,,
,871,All Staff Were Very Helpful And Welcoming,,,,,,
,875,Efficient And Helpful.,,,,,,
,876,The Seats In Reception Are Right Next To The Door Making It Crowded And Cluttered. If You Arrive When Guests Are Leaving It Gets A Bit Much When You Have Luggage With You Too - I Would Recommend Having A Bit More Room To Enter And Exit The Hotel With The Reception Desk And Chairs Taking Less Room From The Passage Of People.,,,,,,
,881,Just That Loud Fan,,,,,,
,882,All Excellent.,,,,,,
,885,We Booked In On The Winter Warmer Package But When We Arrived Nothing Was Mentioned On This. We Were Supposed To Get Flask Of Coffee And Walking Guides Etc But Didn't  Although The Money For Dinner Was Removed From The Bill. ,,,,,,
,889,Needed To Be Warned About The Low Ceiling Outside Room 29  And As We Arrived In The Dark To Have The Fire Escape Mentioned. Diagram On Door Was Upside Down And Inaccurate.,,,,,,
,890,No,,,,,,
,891,No It Was All Fine - We Were Assisted With Our Luggage Which Was Important.,,,,,,
,892,It Was All Good!,,,,,,
,893,The Receptionist When We Checked In Was Very Friendly And Polite. The Receptionist On Our Departure Got The Bill Wrong But It Was Early Corrected. ,,,,,,
,894,Again  Much More Comprehensive Feedback In My Review On Trip Advisor. We Thought The Staff Were Welcoming  Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,,
,895,We Did Have A Few Problems With Making Our Booking  Including At One Point Being Sent A Confirmation At Double The Price That Had Been Quoted And Published.  All A Little Disconcerting But Eventually Sorted Out.,,,,,,
,904,Nice But Not A Special Welcome From Any Of The Staff.,,,,,,
,905,On Arrival We Were Shown To Our Suite But Were Given Information On Breakfast Times Or General Info. Asking If We'd Like A Morning Paper Might Also Have Been Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,906,Pre-Arrival - Staff Were Helpful And Pleasant As They Were On Arrival.,,,,,,
,907,Contacted Prior To Arrival To Confirm Our Booking And Ask Whether We Had Any Special Requirements.,,,,,,
,912,All Was Fine,,,,,,
,915,No.,,,,,,
,925,By Occupying Room 23 I Proved I Am Still More Physically Than I Thought I Was! Super Room  Access Difficult!,,,,,,
,927,Staff Efficient And Professional  Friendly But Not Over-Familiar,,,,,,
,928,Spotted Traffic Wardens Outside - Finding A Longer Period Space Can Be Frustrating,,,,,,
,929,No -  Very Friendly,,,,,,
,930,Pre Arrival Contact Was Made In Relation To Questions About Parking  Which Were Answered. The Welcome From Desk Staff And Other Staff Members Was Faultless. Thank You.,,,,,,
,932,On Arrival The Staff On Reception Were Very Helpful And Friendly But At First They Told Us To Go Through To The Bar Mistaking Us For An Afternoon Tea Booking Despite Being Given Our Amazon Voucher And Being Told That We Were Staying And Would Like To Go To Our Room.  However This Mistake Was Soon Rectified.,,,,,,
,933,I Was Passed Around Quite A Bit When I Called To Make My Booking Which Seemed Unnecessary But The Staff Were Friendly. Our Welcome On Arrival Was Good.,,,,,,
,934,Anna  The Receptionist Was Very Welcoming And Charming.,,,,,,
,937,Helpfully Changed Our Dates For Trip And Kindly Upgraded Our Room,,,,,,
,938,Most Welcoming,,,,,,
,939,We Have Visited The Feathers On Several Occasions And Always Look Forward To Our Return Visits.,,,,,,
,940,We Could Not Wish For A Better Stay.,,,,,,
,941,Reception Stay Were Lovely.,,,,,,
,943,On Arrival The Very Friendly And Helpful Receptionist Took Our Booking Paper And Put It Straight Into A Drawer.  With Surprise I Mentioned That We Would Like To Go To Our Room As We Were Staying Overnight.  She Ignored This And Told Us To Go Into The Bar!!  She Had Obviously Not Looked At The Paper And Took Us For An Afternoon Tea Booking.,,,,,,
,944,Always Polite And Friendly  Overall A Good Experience,,,,,,
,947,No,,,,,,
,949,Very Helpful Staff Who Did The Most Essential Thing First - Arranged For A Cup Of Tea! Well Done !,,,,,,
,952,No,,,,,,
,965,The Telephone Call To Confirm That We Were Still Coming Was Very Welcome  It Might Be A Good Idea To Explain The Parking Arrangements During This?,,,,,,
,968,Helpfully Moved Dates Of Reservation,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
