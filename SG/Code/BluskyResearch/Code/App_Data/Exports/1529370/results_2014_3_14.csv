,786,Lovely Stay.,,,,,,
,787,Relaxed  Efficient  Friendly And Good Value.,,,,,,
,788,Really Lovely - It Was Just What We Wanted!,,,,,,
,790,Very Good  Food And Gin Were Amazing  And Great To Have To Free Pass To Blenheim. He Had Room 51  Really We'll Decorated And Appointed  Only Negative Points Were The Noisy Staircase On The Other Side Of The Wall To The Bed Head (Not Too Much You Can Do About That Though I Guess!) And The Water Pressure Of The Shower Was Very Low. Other Than That We Had A Great Stay ,,,,,,
,791,First Class. We Had A Lovely Visit  As We Always Do. ,,,,,,
,792,We Feel Like 'At Home.',,,,,,
,794,A Very Luxurious Stay! Great Food  Lovely Service And Comfy Room.,,,,,,
,795,Very Luxurious  Comfortable  Lovely Room And Bed. Excellent Selection Of Gin!,,,,,,
,796,Food Good Although Breakfast Buffet For Those Who Don't Want Cooked Breakfast Was A Bit Thin On Choice. No Croissants Even! Room Nice But Small,,,,,,
,797,My Husband & I Enjoyed Ourselves The Staff Were Friendly & Attentive. We Did Feel That In A Reasonably Short Period Of Time The Feathers Was Looking A Tad Sad & We Were Dissapointed That Food That We Had So Enjoyed On Our Previous Stay Was Not Available. That Doesn't Mean The Food Was Poor This Visit Just That The Astonishing Quality That We Had Relished With The Chef's Menu Was Not To Be.,,,,,,
,798,Absolutely Divine  A Big Bloke Even Carried Our Bags Up! The Room Was Fabulous And Breakfast A Real Experience  Superb. Thank You.,,,,,,
,799,It Was A Little Treat In The Working Week As The Rate - £89 - Was Competitive.  ,,,,,,
,800,Short But Sweet,,,,,,
,801,Couldn't Be Faulted  Service Excellent. Only Small Comment Is That The Pillows Are Too Soft!,,,,,,
,803,As There Did Not Appear To Be A Manager In Charge We Found Most Of The Staff Although Polite And Friendly Very  Inexperienced.  ,,,,,,
,804,Lovely Room  Great Staff Which Made The Weekend.,,,,,,
,805,Absolutely Perfect,,,,,,
,806,Staff Were Excellent  Couldn't Be More Helpful. Slightly Disappointed With The Meal Portions  But This Did Not Spoil Our Stay. Quite Impressed With The Gin Bar  And Would Suggest You Advertise This More Prominently. Once Again Thank The Staff On Our Behalf.,,,,,,
,807,Exactly What Was Required,,,,,,
,808,Good,,,,,,
,809,Warmth  Style  Comfort  Relaxation.......,,,,,,
,810,Good Valu With Helpful Staff,,,,,,
,811,Comfortable Room  Good Food Great Gin Bar And Above All Friendly Staff Made Our Stay Special.,,,,,,
,812,Really Lovely,,,,,,
,813,My Daughter And I Enjoyed A Lovely Evening At Your Hotel All The Staff Were Extremely Helpful And Polite And The Setting Was Perfect. Thank You Very Much Jessica Emery,,,,,,
,814,Good Time Had Whilst We Stayed At The Feathers. The Service And Food Was Of A Very High Standard. The Room We Had Was A Little Tired. The Plug In The Bath Did Not Work And We Had To Call For Assistance. This Came Very Quickly But We Were Told That It Is A Known Fault And Needed To Be Repaired........Why Put Someone In The Room When It Has A Known Concern. Also  Our Room Had A Lovely Mirror On The Dressing Table. It Could Not Be Used As It Just Swings On Its Hinges And Does Not Stay In Place. A Little Sad. I'm Sure Your Other Rooms Are Of A Very High Standard As The Hotel Came Highly Recommended. We Look Forward To Trying Out Another Room In The Future.,,,,,,
,815,I Think You Need To Get Your Front Door Key Situation Sorted And Ensure That Everyone Who Is Booked Into A Room Has A Key - As That Was An Aspect Which Was Slightly Odd About My Short Overnight Stay Where Two People Were On A Different Schedule Of Work.  Secondly I Think You Need To Be Very Clear Why You Dont Have Kettles In The Town House ( I Guess Fire Regs Or Insurance Right?) And To Make It Really Clear That If Someone Would Like Morning Tea Or Afternoon Tea Served In The Room At A Discounted Rate (Because You Are Not M Aking Available The Option To Have This In Your Room Made By Yourself) They Are To Feel Really Cool About Disturbing You Guys To Bring It Over - Or To Also Offer Afternoon Tea In Your Lounge At Discount As Part Of The Package With That Room Option. It Would Have Helped If You Had A Bottle (.75 L) Of Water In The Room With A Couple Of Glasses Instead - Which Sort Of Sends The Same Hospitality Message As A Kettle And Teacups Do In Standard Larger Hotel Operations.   It Was Also Confusing As To Which Breakfast Was Entailed In The Package I Booked In For And Some More Clarity On That One As We Booked In Would Have Been Good. I Think That You Are Definitely Missing A Trick By Not Mentioning That You Have Wifi - Indeed Free Wi Fi Across Your Accomodation - As I Nearly Didnt Book Into The Feathers As It Was Not Mentioned And I Knew That My Partner Was Thinking Of Doing Some Work Whilst I Was Out At My Meeting - Some Of The Sites You Have Put Your Details On Do Not Mention This And You Need To Put That Right For Business Overnighters If Not Those Taking A Break! Many Thanks,,,,,,
,816,Beautiful Old Hotel With A Very Gracious And Welcoming Staff.  The Room Was Lovely. It Was Old But Beautifully Updated In Such A Way That Everything Worked Together.  The Staff Is Fantastic And Will Even Deliver Coffee To Your Room In The Morning As Part Of The Service. ,,,,,,
,817,Ok,,,,,,
,818,Nice Ambiance  Great Food  Friendly Staff  Overall Great Stay We Will Be Back Next Year Hopefully.,,,,,,
,820,Comfortable Luxury Home From Home ,,,,,,
,821,Much More Relaxed Than Previous Visits Restaurant Had A More Relaxed Feel And Portion Sizes Were Improved Reservation Staff Very Helpful And All Staff Excellent During Stay Definately Our Favourite Visit To Date.,,,,,,
,823,Pitch Perfect For An Overnight Treat,,,,,,
,824,Lovely,,,,,,
,825,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Ladies Shopping Trip. We Received A Friendly Welcome From Reception And Our Room Was Upgraded. The Bar Is A Very Relaxing Place  The Only Downside Is The Lack Of Snacks Offered. There Were Only Olives Available Which Are Not To Everyones Taste. Other Nibbles Would Have Been Great Whilst Having An Early Evening Drink. We May Have Stayed In The Bar Longer If This Had Been The Case. The Food And Service In The Restaurant  Both At Dinner And Breakfast Was First Class.,,,,,,
,826,Our Only Problem Was The Size Of The Bed Which The Receptionist Said She Would Change Our Room But We Decided To Stay Put.  Have Put On Favourable Report On Trip Adviser,,,,,,
,827,Very Lovely Room - We Got An Upgrade - Excellent Food And Very Friendly Staff.,,,,,,
,828,Very Good In The Restaurant And Bar.  Reception Polite But Weak,,,,,,
,829,It Was Ok  The Staff Were Very Helpful  We Found The Atmosphere Slightly Sterile  No Music  A Wee Bit Crafty In The Dining Room   The Room Was Really Cosy And The Bed Comfortable.,,,,,,
,830,We've Stayed At The Feathers Many Times Over The Years In A Variety Of Rooms (Including The Excellent Suite 4) And It's Usually A Very Pleasant Place To Stay. We Had An Issue With A Generator Located In The Basement Under Our Room - Number 51. It Kept Resetting Itself Every Few Seconds. I Mentioned It To The Receptionist Around 7Pm And She Did All She Could To Resolve It - And For A Few Hours It Was All Quiet. Unfortunately Around 11Pm It Started Up Again And Carried On Through The Night - I Felt It Too Late To Mention Again So Did My Best To Get Some Sleep.We Will Be Returning - Probably Using The £149 Room Offer We Were Given By Your Staff - Sometime In February / March 2014 But We'd Like To Avoid Room 51 If Possible! It Also Suffers From Being On The Ground Floor And Next To A Set Of Very Noisy Stairs! Other Than This The Food Was Good And The Staff Pleasant As Ever. ,,,,,,
,831,Perfect - Although Room Was A Little Small!  Food Was Amazing And Staff Very Welcoming! ,,,,,,
,832,Stay Was Good Overall. However We Were Slightly Disappointed With The Food. We Chose To Have Dinner At The Hotel - Main Course Was Good. The Tarte Tatin Was Unlike Any Other Tarte Tatin I Have Had! No Caramelisation Of The Apple But 3 Slices Of Apple On Top Of Each Other Only Just About Cooked! The Icecream However Was Very Good.  Breakfast - The Addition Of A Fruit Salad Would Be Nice. Some Of The Toast Was Very Burnt.  ,,,,,,
,833,Very Enjoyable (Although We Booked For Another Couple And Didn't Stay) The Meal We Had Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,834,Everything Was Excellent  As Expected From Reccomendation.,,,,,,
,835,The Staff Were Polite And Welcoming And Our Room Was Nice And Clean.    Things To Note  Our Room Was A Disabled Room And Therefore The Bathroom Facilities Were Not What We Were Expecting.  We Had Not Been Told Of This When We Booked.  Our Room (52) You Can Hear The People Upstairs Moving About  Quite Clearly  Which Was Annoying When They Were Constantly Walking About The Room At 11Pm At Night.  Our Room Had No Wifi  Which My Husband Needed To Do Some Work  But The Duty Manager Did Give Us A Reduction In The Rate For This  Which Was Very Kind And The Right Thing To Do. Breakfast Was A Disappointment  I Ordered Eggs Benedict  On Apparently A Home Made Muffin.  When It Came It Has Serrano Ham (Which It Should Not Have Been) And The Homemade Muffin Was A Toasted Sesame Seed Burger Bun! Apart From All This  The Hotel Was Nicely Decorated  Clean And All Staff Were Courteous.,,,,,,
,836,Good Room And Good Food. Only Downside Was No Parking,,,,,,
,837,It Was Ok. There Was No Tea And Coffee In Room. Struggled To Stay Connected To Internet. Chef Didn't Arrive In Morning So We Couldn't Have A Cooked Breakfast. Very Disappointing.,,,,,,
,838,Could Not Find Fault!!!!  Very Relaxing  Excellent Food  Excellent Service.  Thank You Very Much!,,,,,,
,839,Lovely Staff. Comfortable Bed! Enjoyed The Gun Bar,,,,,,
,840,We Enjoyed The Hotel. The Front Desk Were Very Kind And Attentive. The Room Was Comfortable .A Mirror Is Badly Needed In The Bathroom. I Believe It Was Room 36.  Breakfast Buffet Choice Was Quite Poor!  We Would Come Back. ,,,,,,
,841,Charming Personal Service  Friendly And Very Helpful. Great Suite Number 5  Very Spacious And Full Of Character. Dana Was Superb! ,,,,,,
,842,Service Was Good  Especially By The Fellow At Breakfast  Bath Taps Poor Quality And Too Complicated ! ,,,,,,
,843,We Had A Wonderful Time And Delighted To Be Upgraded To A Suite As It Was My Husbands Birthday. Not Likely To Stay Again As We Live Quite Close But Would Visit For Dinner And Recommend ,,,,,,
,844,The Room Was Very Comfortable And The Good Very Good.  The Staff Were Also Very Good Although They Kept Getting My Name And Title Wrong.  Just Because Iw As A Woman Travellign Alone Does Not Mean I Am Single.  My Title Is Actually Dr But I Was Referred To As Miss.  Overall Though My Stay Was Very Nice.,,,,,,
,845,A Most Enjoyable Stay.The Hotel Was Very Welcoming Rooms Very Comfortable And The Cuisine Excellent.Also Enjoyed Pre Dinner Gin And Tonics In The Excellent Gin Bar.,,,,,,
,846,Excellent Service. All The Staff Were Great - Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. Only Two Suggestions - We Asekd The Waietr What Two Things Were On Our Plates - He Didn't Know - We Think He Ought To. And Fix The Glass In The Bathroom Window - There Is A Gap Betweeen Glass And Frame In Eagle Suite,,,,,,
,847,All Staff And Reception Always Excellent  This Visit And Previous. This Visit Staff Seemed A Bit More Stressed? Breakfasts  In Room  Late Both Mornings  But  Served With Nice Apologies. Dinner  On Our Second Night  Was Slow On Service And The Main Course Was Served  Not Hot  And Without One Of The Vegetables  Which  When Queried  Came Cold In A Side Dish? We Did Report These Issues Before We Checked Out. A Shame  Because We Do Like The Hotel.   ,,,,,,
,848,Our Experience Was Far Better Than Our Expectations.  The Staff Were Exceptional  And We Felt No Request Would Have Been Too Much.  Our Room Was Beautifully Clean  And Every Aspect Was To A High Standard.  Our Meal Was Amazing  And We Even Had A Surprise Of An Extra Course  Personalised For Our Wedding Anniversary.  Our Thanks To All Staff  And Compliments To The Chef.,,,,,,
,849,Elegant  Calm  Classy Surroundings And A Delicious Breakfast Served In A Beautiful Restaurant.,,,,,,
,851,Lovely Hotel Always A Pleasure To Visit. Staff Very Helpful Even When Extremely Busy  Food Is Very Good And Service Excellant  Will Certainly Return.   ,,,,,,
,852,Excellent Service From Friendly Staff; Although We Had One Of The Smaller Rooms It Was Comfortable And Well Appointed; Excellent Food Both In The Evening And Breakfast. Loved The Gin Bar. It Was Pleasant To Be Able To Sit In Comfort And Privacy Prior To Our Meal In The Evening. Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.,,,,,,
,853,Friendly  Helpful Staff. Very Comfortable Room ( Peacock) Good Food And Gin!,,,,,,
,854,Lovely Staff  Nice Room  Loved Woodstock,,,,,,
,857,Excellent Room. Good Value Package,,,,,,
,858,A Charming Hardworking Team Ensured A Lovely Stay. The Effort Was 100%. The Result Was 85% The Difference Was The Fact That A Lot Of The Team Were Clearly New To Their Jobs; Courteous And Keen But Still Building Experience . The Room Was Outstanding And The Way Staff Endeavoured To Make Us Comfortable Was Also Very Good. The Front Of House Could Perhaps Have Done With An Extra Pair Of Hands But This May Not Be Valid When The Team Is All Firing On All Cylinders . The Food Was Very Good Off A Narrow Menu . Enough For Us But Fussy People Might Think It Too Short.,,,,,,
,859,Outstanding Comfort And Hospitality In A Style Combining The Best Of Old And New.,,,,,,
,860,Friendly Staff  Great Rooms And Fantastic Food. ,,,,,,
,861,Thr Room Did Not Meet Our Expectations. Although We Accept The Price Had Been Slashed The Previosly Advertised Price Gave The Impression That This Was A Superior Style Room.However The Overall Experience Was Very Pleasant.,,,,,,
,862,Sadly It Was Very Ordinary As Compared With A Previous Visit About 2 Years Ago,,,,,,
,863,Great Service Throughout Is Your Strongest Feature. Food Excellent. Our Room At The Top Of The Hotel  Was Ok  Could Of Been A Little More Updated. Overall Loved It. ,,,,,,
,866,Everything Was Perfect  We Stayed About Three Years Ago And Always Wanted To Come Back Again. ,,,,,,
,867,Very Enjoyable.,,,,,,
,868,Excellent And Helpful Welcome In Reception.  Lovely Room And Facilities.  Meal Ok But Not Memorable.  Drinks Far Too Expensive  £72 For 3 Double Brandies.  The Price Of Alcohol Woukld Put Me Off Staying Again Or Recommending It To Friends,,,,,,
,869,We Were Looking For A Real Christmas Experience And Getaway With My 93 Year Od Mother In Law And We Found It At The Feathers.  Truly  All Of Our Expectations Were Exceeded..The Food Was Amazing  The Service Outstanding And Everyone Was Friendly And Helpful.  A Wonderful Holiday!,,,,,,
,870,Very Nice,,,,,,
,871,A Very Relaxing Christmas With Excellent Food And Friendly Service Throughout.,,,,,,
,873,Breakfast Was Awesome...,,,,,,
,874,Wonderful Christmas,,,,,,
,875,Restful And Enjoyable.,,,,,,
,876,Unfortunately The Water (Not The Fault Of The Hotel) Was Off When We Arrived  So My Wife Couldn't Have The Bath She Was Looking Forward To  And Toilets Couldn't Be Flushed For About 4 Hours - Not A Great Start! When I Asked The Receptionist For Some Water To Be Able To Wash My Hands With  She Had To Go And Check If That Was Ok Before Getting Me A Couple Of Bottles!!  Staff Were Friendly Enough  And The Food  Drink  And Accommodation Was Excellent And Relaxing  But The Main Reason I Was Disappointed Was That I Specifically Mentioned That It Was My Wife's Birthday During Booking  And Nothing Was Done To Honour That Fact - Perhaps A Small Cake With A Candle Could Have Been A Nice Gesture. Instead  We Got A "Happy Birthday" As We Walked Out Of The Restaurant  Despite My Re-Iterating To Staff It Is My Wife's Birthday At The Start Of The Meal  To Which I Got A "We Know!" Making Me Think That Some Small Token Was Imminent...   Having Stayed At Many Other Hotels It Is Not Uncommon To Have A Gesture Like This And A Bit Of Thought From Your Staff Would've Gone A Long Way  Unfortunately On This Occasion It Didn't.  When Checking Out  We Had Been Charged For Glasses Of Wine With The Meal Which We Didn't Have! I Think The Gin With The Gin Fusion Menu Was Quite Enough Without The Need For Wine Too! A Bit Embarrassing Having To Explain That During Checkout!  Not Quite Up To Our Expectations I'm Afraid!,,,,,,
,877,Very Enjoyable And Staff Very Helpful And Friendly. The Room Was Really Good. ,,,,,,
,878,Food Good  Rooms Good  Service Good,,,,,,
,879,The Staff Could Not Have Been More Accommodating  Really Made My Stay A Pleasure!,,,,,,
,881,Service Was Great However The Room Had A Very Noisy Fan  Switched Off The One In Our Bathroom But Still There Was A Bad Noise All Night. ,,,,,,
,882,Lovely. Friendly  Warm  Welcoming  Outstanding Food  Beautiful Facilities. ,,,,,,
,883,Excellent Accommodation  Attentive Staff  Awful Weather,,,,,,
,884,Disappointing. We  Have Stayed Before And Noticed A Definite Deterioration In The Overall Standard,,,,,,
,885,Wonderfully Relaxed - The Suite Was Beautiful And All Service Was Great,,,,,,
,886,Food Excellent Service Slow For Afternoon Tea As We Were On Package Not Very Organised Re Timings Of Afternoon Teas Etc And On New Year's Eve We Had To Ask For Our Drink On Arrival We Purchased A Martini 007 And Wasn't As Shown In Advertisement And Were Treated Slightly Second Class Citizens On That Evening Making Us Feel A Bit Shoved In Background - Other Than That Room Was Lovely And Food Excellent,,,,,,
,887,Rooms Were Wonderful.....The Restaurant Was Disappointing....But Overall Very Nice.,,,,,,
,889,Mostly Good,,,,,,
,890,A Relaxing Stay With Lovely Staff.,,,,,,
,891,Excellent.  Only One Minor Blemish - The Wardrobe In Our Room Was Far Too High And Would Have Needed A Step Or Ladder To Enable Us To Comfortably Hang Up Our Clothes.,,,,,,
,892,From The Moment We Arrived  We Were Treated Courteously And Helpfully By The Staff Who Bent Over Backwards To Satisfy Our Needs (Some Of Which Were Extreme!). Our Room Was Very Tastefully Decorated And Comfortable With All The Facilities We Required  We Found It Both Functional And Elegant. The Gala Dinner Food Was Better Than Expected Being Almost Fine Dining Standard - For Such Large Number Catering It Was Exceptional. Breakfast (Not Brunch?) Again Was Excellent  With A Very Good And Interesting Choice Of Dishes. The Entertainment  Although Minimal Was Very Pleasant And Just Right For The Place Available. Overall  We Were More Than Happy With The Whole Package  Which Was Difficult To Fault  And We Will Certainly Spread The Word!,,,,,,
,893,We Loved The Room And The Service Was Excellent  If We Had Perhaps Paid Full Price For Our Stay I Might Of Cared More About The Small Issues But As This Was A Amazon Local Deal I Felt That The Stay Offered Excellent Value. ,,,,,,
,894,Dear Peter Please Could You Refer To My Trip Advisor For Our Feedback. Its The Review Entitled ' A Glittering Star At The Top Of Our Christmas Tree'.,,,,,,
,895,We Really Enjoyed Our Return Visit To The Feathers For The New Year Celebration Package. The Service Was Excellent And Friendly And The Hotel Was Comfortable.,,,,,,
,896,We Very Much Appreciated The Warmth Of The Welcome And The Attention Given To Us By Your Staff.,,,,,,
,897,Enjoyed Overall Experience. ,,,,,,
,898,It Was A Lovely Couple Of Relaxing Days. We Were Looked After Perfectly By All At The Feathers. Thank You.,,,,,,
,899,Excellent Staff Very Friendly Plus A Very Nice Atmosphere ,,,,,,
,900,Nice Atmosphere For New Year's Eve  Canapes And Cocktails Started The Evening Off Well.  Lovely Dinner  Good Tastes And Well Presented Food.  Service Was Attentive And Friendly.  ,,,,,,
,901,A Good Relaxing Time. The Service Was Excellent And The Food Very Good,,,,,,
,902,Very Enjoyable. Everyone Was Great.,,,,,,
,903,Enjoyable ,,,,,,
,904,Pleasant But Not Overly Special. No-One To Take Our Bags To Our Room  Etc. The Little Things..,,,,,,
,905,Fantastic Gin Fusion Dinner And Gin Bar But Very Average Service.,,,,,,
,906,Lovely Reception Area With Pleasant Staff.  We Were Upgraded To A Suite Without Even Asking  Which Was Lovely.  The Bedroom Of Suite 2 Was Fantastic With A Very Comfortable Bed.  The Only Very Slight Problem Was That We Couldn't Tune The Television.  The Receptionist Tried To Help But She Wasn't Sire How To Do But Between Her And My Husband The Managed To Do It.  Also  The Shower In That Bedroom Need Attention As The Water Flow Is Not Very Good.  The Food In The Restaurant Was Excellent  Including The Breakfast Next Morning.,,,,,,
,907,An Enjoyable Stay But The Restaurant Service Was Disappointing  45 Minutes For The Amuse Bouche And 2.5 Hours To The Dessert.  Our Bottle Of Wine Offered To Another Table!  The Food Was Good So No Complaints There.  Room Was Good And Staff Very Friendly.,,,,,,
,908,This Was My Second Visit And We Stayed Through An Amazon Local Deal For Dinner Bed And Breakfast For £129. This Is An Excellent Deal And I Would Certainly Stay Again If I Saw A Similar Deal. The Food Was Excellent And The Service Very Good. The Only Part Of The Stay We Were Not 100% Happy With Was The Room. We Stayed In Room 14 Which Sadly Has  Very Bad Mould Issue On All Windows In The Room. This Lead To My Asthmatic Husband Struggling A Little With His Breathing By Morning. We Do Understand It Is Hard With Those Old Windows To Stop Mould Completely But The Cleaning Of The  Mould More Regularly Would Make A Huge Difference. ,,,,,,
,909,Welcoming And V Friendly Staff. Comfortable Gin Bar Exciting ,,,,,,
,910,Overall The Experience Was Good...Reception Very Helpful  Room Lovely  Bed Comfortable.  Restaurant Experience Could Have Been Better...But Generally Good. ,,,,,,
,912,Excellent; We Had A Great Time,,,,,,
,914,I Had A Lovely And Very Comfortable Room  Seems Like A Great Place For A Relaxing Weekend. The Kitchen Was Closed For Refurbishment So Didn't Get To Sample The Cuisine But Enjoyed The General Ambience Of The Hotel.,,,,,,
,915,Delightful  Despite The Problem With The Flooded Kitchen!,,,,,,
,917,Pity The Kitchen Was Flooded But We Enjoyed Dinner At The Kings Arms,,,,,,
,918,Concept Good But Lack Staff Training Led To A Poor Experience,,,,,,
,920,Excellent In Every Aspect,,,,,,
,921,Staff Were Friendly And Approachable Room Was Wonderful And Warm Tea And Coffee In Room Was A Little Hit And Miss.  First Coffee Was Stewed! It Would Be Helpful If The Team Had More Understanding Of Coealic Requirements (Not Unfriendly But Suggesting Pastries Full Of Gluten For Breakfast Is Not Going To Work!!!!)  ,,,,,,
,922,Friendly  Comfortable  Good Food.,,,,,,
,925,Ok But My Leek And Potato Soup At Supper Was Bright Green And Had A Strong Garlic Odour! At Breakfast My Egg Was Only Part Fried And No Hash Browns Available! The Chef's Morning Off Perhaps? And On The Bill I Reckon £6.60 For A Medium Sized Glass Of Bombardier Bitter Was Excessive! The Receptionist Didn't Comment To My Complaint!,,,,,,
,926,A Pleasant Yet Short Stay - Food Very Rich But Well Presented. Our Main Issue Was That Our Room Was Unbearably Hot... Quite An Uncomfortable Night Despite Opening Window. Open Fires Roaring Downstairs Were Attractive And Welcoming But Just Too Much For A Mild Feb Eve,,,,,,
,927,Excellent In Almost Every Aspect.  The Only Slight Negative (Not Worthy Of Complaint At The Time) Was The Breakfast: No Prunes  "Hotcake" With Maple Syrup And Banana Came Minus Banana And With  I Suspect  Honey But Definitely Not Maple.  Otherwise We Were Thrilled To Be Upgraded To A Fabulous Suite  Loved The Gin Bar (Saffron - Wow!) And Thoroughly Enjoyed The Taster Menu With Your Choice Of Wines.  Each Dish Was Delicious  Carefully Judged And Extremely Well-Executed.  I'm Sure We Benefited From Choosing A Week-End In Early Feb (The Upgrade) But No Doubt Your Other Rooms Are Pleasant.  Anyway  We Look Forward To Coming Back. ,,,,,,
,928,Relaxing  Good Food  And Friendly Staff,,,,,,
,929,It Was A Very Good Evening  Including The Food Which Was Good Value.,,,,,,
,930,It Was A Lovely Stay  The Staff Were Polite  Friendly And Courteous. We Loved The Room And The Quirk Of Having The Bedrooms Just Across The Road  Was A Lovely Unique Feature. Compliments To The Chef For Our Evening Meal And Lovely Smoked Salmon Breakfast. Already Planning Out Next Vist To Coincide With The Re-Opening Of Blenheim Gardens In The Spring. Thanks Again For A Lovely Couple Of Days.,,,,,,
,932,The Staff Were Efficient And Friendly And Nothing Was Too Much.  The Food Excellent.  The Bedroom Very Comfortable.,,,,,,
,933,The Welcome Was Good And The Room Was Lovely (Suite 3). I Liked That Tea And Coffe Was Brought By Room Service. Service In Both The Restuarant And Bar Was Quite Slow And Not Particularly Attentive. We Had The Gin Fusion Menu And Didn't Always Get The Gin At The Same Time As The Corresponding Course Which I Assume Is The Point. ,,,,,,
,934,Good Service And Food.,,,,,,
,935,Enjoyable,,,,,,
,936,We Stayed Here For The Gin Experience. However  There Was No Q Tonic Available (Although The Website Mentions It Specifically)  No Gin To Make The 'Ultimate G&T' As Per The List Of Drinks On The Website  And The Gin Fusion Menu Was Not At All To Our Liking (No Vegetarian Option At All). We Asked About This As It Was Not The One Which Was Offered Online. We Were Told That This Was Simply A Sample Menu  Although No Where Did It Actually Say That. The Maître D' Offered Us The Tasting Menu Instead Which We Had  But Did Not Enjoy Very Much. He Did Bring Us Gins But They Arrived A Course Too Late.
The Following Morning  The Bacon At Breakfast Was Overcooked And The Coffee Was Not Fair Trade.
Service Was Not Good. We Did Not Get A Sense That Anyone Was In Charge And During Dinner  It Was At Times Nothing Short Of Farcical.
I'm Also Disappointed That When I Booked  The Receptionist Made A Big Thing About 2 Free Tickets To Blenheim Palace. She Omitted To Mention That It Was Closed At The Time Of Our Visit. We Asked For Them When We Checked Out And Were Disappointed To Find Out That We Would Not Be Going. She Took Our Address And Promised To Send Them. It's Been Over. 2 Weeks But We Haven't Received Them.,,,,,,
,937,We Were Kindly Upgraded Free Of Charge To Room 28 We Stayed In Previously  Which Was A Lovely Consideration. Excellent Friendly Service From Reception  Dining And Aid Service. Excellent Food And Of Course The Gin Selection. I Look Forward To Our Next Stay,,,,,,
,938,We Loved The Village  The Stay At The Hotel Was Delightful. The Staff Were Lovely  Very Friendly And The Stay Was Wonderful.
,,,,,,
,939,We Have Stayed With You Previously And Noted That There Were A Couple Of Finishing Touches Which Were Absent On This Visit But Present Before. These Included Complementary Nibbles At The Bar And The Absence Of A Choice Of Salted And Unsalted Butter Served With Slices Of Bread Rather Than A Choice Of Rolls.  Whilst These Extras Were Not Our Motivation For A Return Visit  Their Absence Was Noticed. ,,,,,,
,940,Just Special In A Special Place. ,,,,,,
,941,Staff Were Lovely  Helpful Friendly And Professional. Room Was Very Small. Breakfast Poor Selection Of Freshly Prepared Fruit. Not Liking Cooked Breakfast  I Do Like A Choice Of Fruit  Not Just Melon . Real Disappointment Was When We Went Into Dinner We Were Only Offered The Tasting Menu And As There Was Nothing On There For My Husband  We Were Made To Feel Awkward When We Asked If There Was An A La Carte Menu And When We Asked For Steak Menu We Were Advised They Would Have To Go And Check If It Was Available. Why Then 
Was It Advertised Outside? When We Did Finally Get Our Fillet Steak It Was Beautiful  Perfectly Cooked.,,,,,,
,942,Superb!,,,,,,

,944,A Lovely Relaxing Stay  With Great Food And Exceptional Standards Of Cleanliness And Service,,,,,,
,945,A Wonderful Stay  Really Relaxing - Beautiful Room  Attentive Service  Generally Excellent All Round.,,,,,,
,947,Pleasant  Relaxing,,,,,,
,948,Just The Break That I Needed. The Staff Were Excellent  The Hotel Was Beautiful And I Can't Wait To Stay Again.,,,,,,

,951,A Special Time With Wonderful Food And Friends ,,,,,,
,952,Very Comfortable With Attentive Staff And Excellent Cocktails!,,,,,,
,953,Good.. Checkin In Great Very Welcoming.. Felt That The Toiletries Could Have Been Better Quality. Gin Bar Great But Could Be Much Better. Dinner Ok.. Wine Glasses Need Changing.. Very Basic. Breakfast Excellent. ,,,,,,
,957,A Very Relaxing Stay  Service Was Excellent And The Staff Were Very Friendly. Also We Loved The Large Bedroom And Bathroom. Will Definetely Be Back,,,,,,
,958,Just Lovely!,,,,,,
,959,Relaxed - Lovely Atmosphere,,,,,,
,962,Good,,,,,,
,965,Thoroughly Enjoyed The Stay. The Hotel Is Old But With A Modern Decor Which Gives It A Very Classy Feel. The Food Was Excellent  So Was The Gin Bar. The Staff Are Attentive  Finding Just The Right Level Without Being Annoying And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. The Lack Of Hotel Parking Was The Only Thing I Feel Should Be Improved. In Summary  We Had A Great Time And Would Definitely Go Back  Taking Friends With Us Too. ,,,,,,
,966,Very Enjoyable  Excellent Service. ,,,,,,
,967,We Booked A Tasting Break Package And Received A Complimentary Upgrade To A Suite. Excellent Value For Money At £149.00 For Two.  Friendly Check In From Jessica.  Suite Was Spacious  The Bed Comfortable And The Bathroom Also Good.  However We Felt That The Interior Decor Was Not Quite Right And Several Items Were More Shabby Than Chic (Particularly The Bedside Tables)  Some Lapses In Housekeeping With Sticky Glass Surfaces And Dust On Lamps And Carved Screen Behind Bed.  Dinner Was Mostly Enjoyed  But As The Dining Room Was So Quiet We Did Not Want To Linger....... Breakfast Good According To My Husband.  Efficient Check Out..   ,,,,,,

,2,Excellent. All The Efforts Of The Staff Were Much Appreciated.,,,,,,
,4,Easy Check-In  Friendly And Professional Staff. Special Thanks To Jessica  Who Was Very Wonderful.,,,,,,
,7,Very Pleasant And Helpful Both Before And During Our Stay,,,,,,
,12,All Very Friendly And Professional.,,,,,,
,18,All Was Good And Very Efficient,,,,,,
,22,Having Stayed Back In February Which We Thoroughly Enjoyed We Took Advantage Of A Emailed Special Offer. The Whole Experience Was Superb And The Food Was Amazing. Thank You So Much  We Hope To Come Again.  Mike Authers,,,,,,
,24,Even The Dog Thought It Was A Lovely Hotel,,,,,,
,27,Reception Was Organised And Efficient  But Not Necessarily Warm And Friendly,,,,,,
,28,I Had To Try Several Calls To Book The Private Dining Room  On Arrival Staff Had Differing Views On When We Could Use The Room. The Court Yard Needed Housekeeping Before Opening To Guests. Ordering Wine  Mineral Water And Requesting Menus  Came Slowly And Individually  At These Prices Service Needs To Be More Professional.,,,,,,
,32,Many Thanks For Uograding Us To A Suite Because It Was A Special Occasion  Much Apprecited.  We Will Certainly Return In The Furture.  The Bathroom Toilet Was Not Clean When We Arrived But As Soon As I Brought It To Receptionists Attention It Was Cleaned Right Away.,,,,,,
,36,The Waitress Who Served Us Our Evening Meal Was Unfriendly And Almost Rude. She Served Us Again The Following Day For Breakfast And Was Equally Grumpy Then. We Were Not The Only People Who Experienced Her Bad Mood! Also  The Toilet In Our Suite Smelt Quite Badly If Urine. We Mentioned It To Reception Who Assured Someone Would Come And Give The Loo A Clean But This Never Materialised  Consequently We Our Room Smelled Quite Strongly Of A Men's Urinal.,,,,,,
,42,It Was Not Clear From The Booking Website That There Was A Reduction For Single Occupancy.,,,,,,
,45,Hmm. You Kept Sending Me E-Mails Asking About My Experience Before I Had Actually Stayed!! No Big Deal Though.,,,,,,
,46,Because Of Our Age We Endeavour To Avoid Hotels That Do Not Provide An Elevator If Our Accommodation Is Upstairs.  We Failed To Check Whether This Was The Case.  However In The Instance Of Our Stay Your Receptionist Insisted That We Leave Our Suitcases In The Foyer And A Staff Member Delivered Them To Our Room For Which We Were Most Grateful.,,,,,,
,49,Resturant Staff Very Surly Especially The Breakfast 'Manager',,,,,,
,51,No Problems With Reception Staff,,,,,,
,53,My Reservation Was For 2 X Twin Rooms  I Cancelled One 4 Days Prior To Arrival  Upon Arrival I Was Shown To 1 X Double Room ( Reservation Was For A Group Of Ladies). We Were Offered Two Separate Rooms Albeit At Opposite End Of The Hotel  Also We Were Only Notified The Day Before Of The Woodstock Fair Causing A Problem With Parking And Horrendous Noise Outside The Hotel - I Would Not Have Booked If I Had Been Told Earlier.  I Have Stayed Many Times Whilst Travelling On Business And Always Considered The Feathers A Super Hotel  However After This Visit I Am Most Disappointed.,,,,,,
,54,Spanish Receptionist Was Rude On Arrival (Speaking In Spanish) Which We Understood! A Shame As All Other Staff Fantastic,,,,,,
,56,Full Information About The Booking Was Provided To Us Via Email.,,,,,,
,67,Superb  Faultless  Beautiful.,,,,,,
,70,Pre-Arrival Telephone Call Was Very Good - Which Is Why We Were Quite Disappointed When We Actually Arrived - The Staff Were Not Rude But Just Not Welcoming,,,,,,
,72,Very Good Pre Arrival Contact Friendly And Welcoming Receptionist,,,,,,
,73,Our Booking By Sally (May Have Got Name Wrong) Was Handled Brilliantly - She Was Very Helpful. Check In Was Swift And The Offer Of A Cuppa Alovely Touch.,,,,,,
,76,Very Helpful Receptionist Upon Arriving.  Helped Me Up To My Room With My Many Bags  Spoke To The Kitchen And Arranged For Me To Have Dinner In My Room.,,,,,,
,79,There Was No One At The Desk When We First Walked In,,,,,,
,80,A Little Confusing About Parking  But We Live In Bristol  Park For 5 Seconds And You're Charged,,,,,,
,81,Straightforward And Professional,,,,,,
,82,We Were Shown To Our Room And Offered Tea/Coffee  However It Would Have Been Nice To Know That This Was Complimentary. It Would Also Have Been Nice To Know That The Water In The Rooms Was Complimentary.,,,,,,
,83,We Were Offered Tea/Coffee On Arrival To Our Room  However It Would Have Been Nice To Know That This Was Complimentary. Also A Note By The Water To Say That This Was Also Complimentary.,,,,,,
,86,It Would Have Been Nice To Sit By A Fire And Enjoy Our Coffee - But The Only Fire Was In The Reception By The Draughty Door - The 'Snug' Has No Fire And Is Effectively A Corridor To The Rooms.  We Were Surprised There Was No Cosy Lounge.,,,,,,
,94,Service Throughout Was Excellent,,,,,,
,98,Something I Know You Have No Control Over  But Car Parking Would Be Wonderful.,,,,,,
,99,Fantastic!!!,,,,,,
,100,Organised Everything Through Emily. She Was Very Helpful,,,,,,
,104,Unfortunately The Person I Spoke To On The Phone When Booking Our Dinner For 3 Nights Booked The Time Requested (7.30Pm) For One Night Only. Not A Major Problem  But We Had Guests Travelling From Far Away And Couldn't Eat Until 8.30Pm One Night.,,,,,,
,110,Person Greeting Us Was Not Particularly Interested. It Was Almost As Though We Were Disturbing Him !,,,,,,
,111,Excellent Staff,,,,,,
,113,Very Helpful Regarding Parking And Mobility Issues,,,,,,
,125,My Husband Arrived Ahead Of Me And Was Given A Tour And Really Felt This Was A Good Way To Start The Stay. Parking Was Easy Which Really Helped And The Team Put Our Minds At Rest That We Had Parked Correctly.,,,,,,
,136,Arrival Very Slick  Liked Being Escorted To My Room Straight Away,,,,,,
,139,After Telephone Booking I Received A Very Detailed Confirmation Email From The Hotel. On Arrival Was Told That We Had Been Upgraded From A Classic Double To A Superior Double. Considering We Were Already On A Special Package This Was Appreciated. We Were Then Provided With Complimentary Coffees.,,,,,,
,143,Receptionist Helpful And Carried Our Cases To The Room. No One Explained Where There Were Places To Sit And Have A Cup Of Tea And In The End We Were Put In The Dining Room When We Would Have Preferred A Lounge Situation At 4 Pm. We Were Happy To Stay At The Dinner Table After Our Excellent Meal  But There Was Nowhere Else For 6 Of Us To Go As The Only Small Sitting Room We Found Was Reserved For Another Party To Use After Dinner. Staff Helpful About A Birthday Cake And Storing It Until We Left Next Morning.,,,,,,
,147,When I Telephoned To Make A Reservation A Few Days Prior To Travel I Was Quoted An Extremely High Room Rate.I Expressed My Disappointment And Stated That Laterooms Was Advertising A Much Lower Rate And Very Quickly I Was Told That The Hotel Would Match The Rate.I Was Disappointed That I Hadn't Been Offered A More Competitive Quote In The First Instance. On Arrival At Hotel No One Was On Reception And We Had To Wait Several Minutes.However The Receptionist Was Welcoming And Apologised For The Delay.,,,,,,
,151,2 Negatives The First And Most Important Was The Unhealthy Environment Of Room 14. Not A Particularly Attractive Room But The Major Problem Was The Room Temperature Which Must Have Been 40O Plus At 5Pm The Room Is Secondary Glazed And It Was Only Possible To Open A Portion Of The Windows  30 Minutes After Opening These The Room Temperature Was Still Above 35O The Receptionist. Was Very Helpful And We Were Able To Relocate To A Room With Normal Temperatures Lastly We Booked The Room 4 Weeks Prior To Our Arrival On Sunday  Nobody Told Us At The Time Of Booking Or At Any Time Before Our Arrival That Use To The Street Fair We Would Be Unable To Park Anywhere Near The Hotel  This Was A Serious Problem As We Had Several Bags And Clothes Which Had To Be Manhandled . The Feathers Must Have Been Aware Of This But Decided To Keep Us In Ignorance,,,,,,
,155,Always Polite And Professional Yet Informal/Casual. Hard Combination To Get Right!! Made To Feel Very Welcome. Kind Of The Receptionist To Point Out The Travelzoo Offer When Booking Afternoon Tea And Interested In Overnight Stay.,,,,,,
,158,Very Welcoming. Lovely Cup Of Coffee.,,,,,,
,164,See Email Sent To Pride Of Britain,,,,,,
,165,See Email To Pride Of Britain,,,,,,
,166,The Whole Experience Was Really Good,,,,,,
,171,Every Staff Member We Had Contact With At The Feathers Was Courteous And Helpful During The Arrangements Before Our Wedding And On The Day And The Following Morning,,,,,,
,178,No,,,,,,
,179,All The Staff Were Very Friendly And Extremely Welcoming,,,,,,
,180,Thank You Peter For A Very Warm  Professional And Engaging Welcome At The Feathers. Our Delegates (International Hospitality And Tourism Educators) Were Very Impressed With You And Your Work So Far.  From A Professional Point Of View Everything Was Spot On With The Exception Of The Tables Outside Which Were Quite Dirty (Stains  Un-Emptied Ashtrays Etc).   ,,,,,,
,181,Really Enjoyed Our Stay  Staff Were All Lovely  Receptionist On Arrival Went Out Of Her Way To Ensure That We Had The 'Quiet' Room That I Had Requested.  I Was Then So Impressed With Suite 5 That We Choose It Even Though It Was On The Road And Not That Quiet!  It Didn't Detract From Our Overall Enjoyment.  The Food Was First Class.  Must Get On Trip Advisor And Leave The Feedback You Deserve.  Should I Have To Find A Negative It Would Be That The Shower Head In Suite 5 Was Awful!  Overall A Definite 10 Out Of 10,,,,,,
,186,We Were Running Late But We Were Welcomed & Reassured The Restaurant Would Informed & Ready For Us.,,,,,,
,189,Unable To Find A Parking Space,,,,,,
,193,Initial Booking Was Great.  A Problem With Your It System Meant I Received Two 'How Was Your Stay?' Emails Before We'd Even Arrived!  Our Check In Was Interrupted By Some Restaurant Guests Wanting To Settle Their Bill  But Otherwise Went Smoothly.,,,,,,
,194,We Had A Fantastic Experience Staying At Your Hotel  From The Upgraded Room And Rose Petals To The Delicious Gin Tasting Session.  Thank You So Much!,,,,,,
,195,We Were Able To Take Our Dog Who Was Made Very Welcome.,,,,,,
,196,As Stated We Have Not Been Yet  Coming In September.... The Drinks Are On You!!!!!!,,,,,,
,197,Hotel Room And Communal Parts  Far Too Hot,,,,,,
,198,We Did Struggle To Find Somewhere To Park But Obviously This Isn't Your Fault!,,,,,,
,199,I Phoned To Book A Table For Dinner Then Received An Email A Week Later Asking If I Would Like To Make A Dinner Reservation.,,,,,,
,200,Great Gin ,,,,,,
,202,Friendly Is Good  Welcoming Is Great  But Don't Overwhelm Me. It Should Feel Like Coming Home - If A Little Bit Cooler  Chicer And Definitely Tidier!,,,,,,
,205,Staff Very Helpfull And Welcoming,,,,,,
,207,We Were Surprised That We Had Not Been Told Our Room Would Be On The Third Floor And That It Was Not Suitable For The Elderly Or Those With Mobility Problems.,,,,,,
,214,Was Contacted 4 Times Asking For My Credit Card Number  Number Given Each Time.  Filled In Form On Arrival With Card Details Given.  On Leaving Asked Again As The Incorrect Number Was On The Your Form,,,,,,
,215,Although Busy The Receptionist Was Really Helpful,,,,,,
,217,Staff Very Welcoming  Easy Check In,,,,,,
,225,We Have Already Done A Similar Crit On The Otel  It Was Absolutely Terrfic  Food Good  Staff Good Only Problem (For Us) Was The Room  Being Up At Top Of The Building,,,,,,
,226,Best Stay We Have Ever Had  Staff Excellent And Even Called Evening Prior To Ensure We Were Still On Track To Arrive That Evening - Will Be Visiting Again!  Many Thanks,,,,,,
,233,Excellent Service ..,,,,,,
,234,My Wife And I Cannot Speak Highly Enough Of The Wonderful Stay We Had At The Feathers.We Were Celebrating My Wife's Birthday And The Staff Could Not Have Made Us More Welcome.The Meal In The Restaurant On The Saturday Evening Was As Good As Anything We Had Experienced Anywhere And The Service Was Exemplory.Please Thank Everyone For A Delightful Stay. Regards Malcolm And Margaret Evans,,,,,,
,235,Liked The Fact That The Gentleman On Reception Took The Time To Show Us Around The Hotel Before Taking Us To Our Room.,,,,,,
,238,All Staff Were Very Welcoming And Professional. The Decor Is Wonderfully Individual Both In The Room And In The Hotel. It Was A Delightful Stay And We Look Forward To Visiting Again.,,,,,,
,242,It Was Odd To Receive A Request For Comments On My Stay Before It Had Taken Place!,,,,,,
,244,I Booked Four Rooms For My Family.  My Mother Was Upset That Her Room Smelt Musty On Arrival And Had To Ask For The Room To Be Aired.  Your Staff  Of Course  Did This But Unfortunately The Inital 'Wow Factor' Was Tainted For My Parents.,,,,,,
,245,I Personally Would Have Preferred Tea Making Facilities In The Bedroom - Although It Was Offered On Arrival And Told Could Request - For That Early Morning Cup Of Tea Much Easier To Make Yourself Especially If Other Person Is Asleep And You Don't Want Them Disturbed By Someone Bringing Tea Up To The Room.,,,,,,
,252,Excellent Stay And Great Service,,,,,,
,253,I Was Told That Parking Was Available Outside The Hotel. My Daughter And I Spent Half And Hour Looking For A Parking Space. Although He Was Offered Help With The Cases My Husband Did It Himself And Fell Up The Stairs. Please Ignore Elderly People Who May Have Difficulties With The Steps. Our Room Was Not A Twin And We Were Moved. I Think You Should Be Advised That The First Room Key Also Fitted The Room Next Door.,,,,,,
,254,Even Although My Husband Said He Would Take The Cases Up Himself I Am Afraid The Stairs Are Not Conducive For An Elderly Man To Navigate With Luggage As He Fell Up The Stairs When I Came In It Was Only To Find That The Key To Our Room Also Fitted The Other Room Next Door 23/24 And That Our Room Was Not As We Required.  It Was A Double Rather Than A Twin. Also My Daughter Found The Room 14 Extremely Cold And Had Go Ask For An Extra Blanket. She Was Still Cold.,,,,,,
,263,We Were Disappointed That The Gourmet Sunday That We Had Booked Was Withdrawn.  We Were More Disappointed That You Did Not Contact Us About This  We Only Found Out From Subsequent Viewing Of Your Web Page.  We Had To Ask Rather Than Be Told By You. We Have Also Been Confused To Receive 2 Feedback Requests Before Even Staying With You.,,,,,,
,264,Very Helpful In Respect Of My Wife's 'Diet' (Not A Meat-Eater  And Doesn't Like Garlic!),,,,,,
,268,Ipod Dock On Bedside Table Did Not Work. Not Important To Us But Thought We Would Mention It.,,,,,,
,269,Staff In Reception Were Very Helpful And Informative.,,,,,,
,270,Receptionist Very Helpful In Carrying Bag To The Very Top Room.  Little Useful Information Provided  Eg. On Street Car Parking Restrictions Or Not.  It Would Be Helpful To Have Set Out Clearly Exactly What Our 3 Day Package Comprised As It Was Never Clear From Website And No Information Given Upon Arrival,,,,,,
,277,All Staff On Contact And Arrival Very Helpful And Friendly.,,,,,,
,280,All Was Very Good,,,,,,
,286,The Only Disappointment Was Having To Ask To Have My Bottle Of White Wine  Ordered With My Evening Meal  Placed In An Ice Bucket After It Had Been Left On The Table For Over Half An Hour. All Other Guests Had Their Wines In Ice Buckets. Also My Husband And I Had Empty Glasses From Our Pre Dinner Drinks Left On The Table And Again I Had To Ask To Have Them Removed As The Main Course Was Served. Small Points But They Are The Reason Why I Haven't Selected 'Strongly Agree' Above.,,,,,,
,287,A Surprise Celebration Weekend Was Ruined To Many Things To Say But Will Be Talking With The Manager When He Returns From Honeymoon !,,,,,,
,289,I Did Mention That My Husband Had Mobility Problems And Used Sticks.  Pre-Arrival I Was Told That There Was No Lift But We Would Be Accommodated On As Low A Floor As Possible.  However  Our Room Was On The 4Th Floor With A Number Of Stairs To Reach It.  But We Coped And It Did Not Affect The Enjoyment Of Our Stay.  We Are Thinking Of Visiting Again With A Friend With More Severe Mobility Problems (Although Not Wheelchair Bound) And Wonder How She Would Be Accommodated.,,,,,,
,291,The Welcome  The Room  The Food Were All Excellent,,,,,,
,294,Noisy,,,,,,
,295,Hotel Manager Was Very Keen To Help Us With Bags Etc - Especially As The Room Was Difficult To Access With Suitcases!,,,,,,
,302,We Were Both A Bit Disappointed With Our 'Dog Friendly' Room Because It Wasn't As Nice As The Photos On Your Web Site.  We Know That We Had A Good Deal Price Wise But The Room Was Quite Small And Rather Tired And Dark.,,,,,,
,303,Other Than The Fire?,,,,,,
,309,The Room Was Very Hot,,,,,,
,310,No.,,,,,,
,312,Website Had Promised Jelly Beans In The Room...Had Just Told Husband Before We Got To The Room  But No Jelly Beans! Website Should Be Changed  Bit Disappointed (Although Not Massively!).,,,,,,
,313,The Girl On Reception Did Her Job Well. Waiters I Think Came From Falti Towers.,,,,,,
,316,I Experienced Difficulty In Parking Which Took Me Almost An Hour Driving Around Woodstock Before  Finding A Place To Park.  However The Staff Were Sincerely Apologetic And Understanding And Did Their Utmost To Make Sure That Our Stay Was As Comfortable And Enjoyable As Possible  The Hotel Manager And Reception Staff Were Superb Both In Their Warmth And Professional Manner.,,,,,,
,317,Rosie And Warren Great Over Email. Reception Who Welcomed Us On Arrival Was Great Too. All Waiting Staff Were Very Friendly And Informative,,,,,,
,327,We Will Complete Survey After Our Visit In August,,,,,,
,328,This Was Our Second Visit - We Came For The First Time In October - And We Just Love The Feathers And Everything About You,,,,,,
,332,Very Welcoming,,,,,,
,335,The Promotional Offer We Purchased Included Supper And Breakfast  Whilst This Was A Very Good Value For Money Opportunity The Explanation Via The Website Of The  5 Course Dinner Was Insufficient. It Was Not Made Clear That The Menu Was A 'Fixed Menu' Option. However  This Was Delicious And We Are Not Complaining! Just A Thought From A Marketing Perspective  A 5 Course Supper Is Not Everyone's Ideal  An Alternative Choice Option  Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,,
,338,Difficult Car-Parking,,,,,,
,340,I Called Ahead To Advise My Husband Was Lactose Intolerant And This Was Confirmed Prior To Arrival And Made The Stress Of Making Sure Everything Went Smoothly,,,,,,
,342,Fantastic Artistic And Ready To Appeal To Every Different Type Of Person Thankyou,,,,,,
,343,Fantastic,,,,,,
,348,Offering To Carry Bags Is A Nice Touch,,,,,,
,349,The Receptionist Was Very Helpful When She Realised My Husband Was Disabled She Went Out Of Her Way To Accommodate All Our Needs,,,,,,
,352,Was Quoted A Price Then Phoned To Confirm The Next Day The Prices Had Gone Up!  Nearly Walked Away At That Point.,,,,,,
,353,Warren Was A Bit Stroppy On The Phone When I Asked If That Was The Best Price He Could Do After Being Quoted A Much Better Price A Few Days Before.,,,,,,
,354,Excellent Welcome On Arrival And Upgraded When Asked.,,,,,,
,364,You Need To Offer An In House Pressing Service.,,,,,,
,371,We Tried To Book With Your Website But Nothing Available. When We Tried Through Late Rooms We Got A Room. Didn't Really Understand That. Maybe We Should Have Rung Direct. Will Definitely Stay Again.,,,,,,
,376,No Mention Of Specal Offers Given When We Booked With A Voucher And My Daughter Was Assured Such Would Be Available When We Booked With The Voucher . I Noticed That Dinner B&B Winter Break Was Advertised Outside Your Hotel And We Were Not Offered This Rate !?,,,,,,
,377,Welcoming Staff,,,,,,
,380,Shown To  And Around The Room. Nice Touch,,,,,,
,383,My Wife And Did Not Like The First Room Offered To Us It Was Ground Level In The Court Yard Very Dark Etc. Struck Me As Being A Room For A Visitor With Disabilities. We Were Then Shown The Red Kite Room Which Was Fine.,,,,,,
,386,Checking In Was A Bit Slow,,,,,,
,389,Lovely Hotel But We Stayed In Room 29 Mallard  The Room Had A Very Strange Noise Which Went On Into The Early Hours And Started Again At 6Am So Not A Good Night's Sleep - We Did Report It To Reception And Recorded The Noise  But Nothing Happened About It Or Any Explanation Given. Also Service In Restaurant Was Very Slow And Wrong Wine Was Served And We Had A Complain Three Times Before It Was Changed  Another Customer Had The Same Problem. Kind Of Took The Edge Off The Stay  However Woodstock Is A Lovely Place And We Would Consider Staying Again. ,,,,,,
,390,Lovely Food  Wine And Comfy Bed.,,,,,,
,391,Very Welcoming And Everything Straightforward And No Major Issues When Checking In Which Is A Massive Plus!!,,,,,,
,395,No Tea Or Coffee Making Facilities In The Rooms!,,,,,,
,402,Very Efficient Staff.,,,,,,
,414,Rosie And Warren Were Both Very Helpful And Fast At Answering My Questions Via Email,,,,,,
,415,I Found All The Staff To Be Very Warm  Efficient And Friendly. However  I Felt That Some May Find The Service Too 'Casual' If They Are Accustomed To The Standard Hotel Service In Big Cities (I Personally Found It Appropriate). Your Website And Its Overuse Of Pink Makes Some People Avoid Staying At The Hotel  I Feel. It Certainly Made Me Worry About My Decision To Stay And I Did Witness Certain 'Differences' In Our Taste In Varioys Areas Of The Room And Offer Facilities.,,,,,,
,418,The Receptionist Seemed Rather New In Her Job And Hence Not As Able To Answer Queries Quite As Readily As We Might Have Expected.  However  She Was Very Pleasant And Tried Her Best To Assist.,,,,,,
,420,Rosie Was Very Helpful In Sorting Out Several Queries And The Booking Itself. Upon Arrival The Gentleman On The Front Desk Was Polite And Chatty. It's A Great Place!,,,,,,
,424,The Stay Was Good But The Taster Menu Was Too Small. We Had To Go For A Meal Straight After As Were Were Still Hungry. This Was A Big Let Down For Us.,,,,,,
,425,Hotel Lacked Wi- Fi Access In Our Room And Only Had It In Very Specific Locations Such As Sofa At Bar.,,,,,,
,426,We Look Forward To Our Visit. Send The Questionnaire After We Leave.,,,,,,
,428,Pre Arrival Info & Comunication Excellent - Emily I Think . Arrival Poor - Other Than Being Shown To Our Room And Gven The Pink Leaflet Nothing Was Said.,,,,,,
,429,Pre-Arrival Emails - Excellent.  Very Impressed.  Greeting Upon Arrival Very Friendly.  Food Excellent. Rest Was Poor.  Customer Service Was Appalling.  Room Was Noisy And Outside Of Main Hotel Which We Weren't Expecting.  Stair Case Next To Our Room - Where The Head Of The Bed Was And Rooms Above - Noisy.  Upstairs Guests Going In And Out  Staff Delivering Newspapers  And Later On Room Services (Between 7.15-8Am) Really Noisy So Hardly Restful.  Friday - 40 Minutes Of Sitting In Study Before Being Acknowledged Despite 3 Staff Walking Past And Another Couple Actually Being Served Coffee Right Next To Us. Eventually Asked If We Would Like Refreshments By A Different Staff Member - Afternoon Tea Was Very Nice And The Waiter Very Friendly.  When Arriving For Breakfast  I Asked The Receptionist (Male) If We Should Wait Before Entering The Restaurant Or Go Straight In  He Didnt Respond And Continued To View His Pc.  We Went In.  Breakfast - No Tables Available When We Arrived At Approx 9.45Am  All Were Dirty. No Staff Around. So We Stood And Waited.  Table Was Laid Up For Us.  Breakfast Was Very Nice.  We Had Supper In The Hotel On Saturday Night And The Food Was Excellent.  Breakfast On Sunday  Repeat Of Previous Day Only Worse.  No Tea  Coffee  Juices Offered.  No Cereals Bowls.  We Weren't The Last To Arrive So Others Would Have Found The Same Issues. Seemed Surprised That Guests Would Actually Appear For Breakfast!  When Attempting To Check Out  We Had To Find The Staff As There Was No Receptionist.  When A Staff Member Was Found  They Had To Find Someone To Check Us Out.  15 Minutes Later We Managed To Leave.  So  No  We Wouldn't Return.  We Stayed In The Lords Last Year And  Although We Didnt Expect The Same  The Difference Is Quite Amazing.   Your Reputation Brings Guests  Your Customer Service I Think  Will Ensure They Dont Return.  Sorry.  ,,,,,,
,430,Friendly And Unfussy But Warm,,,,,,
,437,Loved My Stay - Slight Suggestion Would Be To Have A Gin Cocktails List As With The Array You Have Would Be A Nice Way Of Complimenting This As Opposed To Just A Normal Cocktail List.  Certainly Will Be Staying Again In The Future.,,,,,,
,441,All Staff Were Extremely Helpful Before And During Our Stay,,,,,,
,442,None At All  Very Pleasing.,,,,,,
,443,I Think The Hotel Is Lovely. We Travel A Lot With Work So We Do Have High Standards. I Think The Staff Let You Down Though. You Do Need Someone At The Bar At All Times. We Witnessed 2 Guests Calling One Of Your Staff Rude  But She Was Great With Us. The Hotel Really Lacks Atmosphere - There Is No Buzz And I Think That Comes Down To Your Staff  Lots Of Smiles  Chatting To Customers. I See That This Is A Constant Them On Review Sites. Rosie Was Very Good Upon Arrival  Everyone Was Cordial But You Need That Extra 'Zing'. By The Way  Great Food In The Restaurant But The Breakfast The Next Day Wasnt So Great. Continental Breakfast Choice Was Really Poor And Service Was A Let Down. The English Breakfast Was Great Though. Just Little Niggles  And If These Are Sorted Out  It Would Be A Buzzing Little Venue. By The Way - Will You Put Tea And Coffee Makers In The Rooms? Makes Such A Difference. Many Thanks,,,,,,
,450,I Am Vegetarian And The Man Who Took Our Bookings Asked Upfront About Dietary Requirements. I Was Really Impressed With That.,,,,,,
,452,All Contact Was Very Pleasant,,,,,,
,453,Our Stay Coincided With A Wedding Party And The Bar Area Was Unavailable,,,,,,
,455,Should Be Advised Of Difficulty In Getting Up Stairs,,,,,,
,459,The Gentleman Who Booked Us In Was Very Welcoming  Professional And Friendly,,,,,,
,461,The Gentleman At Reception Was Amazing Really Warm And Welcoming But Very Professional At The Same Time,,,,,,
,464,Pre-Arrival Contact: I Did Find Pre-Ordering Of Dinner To Be Very Time-Consuming And This Would Put Me Off Bringing A Large Group For Dinner Again,,,,,,
,476,All Excellent,,,,,,
,477,Very Pleasant Receptionist -Emily,,,,,,
,478,No,,,,,,
,483,It Was Better Than The Dorchester In London....,,,,,,
,488,A Bit Chaotic On Arrival. But We Had A Lot Of Luggage And The Reception Area Is Cramped. The Porters Were Exceptionally Helpful.,,,,,,
,489,Person I Spoke To On The Phone During Initial Booking Was Very Helpful And Friendly,,,,,,
,493,The Staff Are Unusually Friendly And Helpful. It Is Rare To Get This Level Of Professionalism In The Uk,,,,,,
,494,Booking Our Stay Was Very Easy And So Nice To Get Personal Responses To Emails And Promptly Too. Rosie In Particular. Queries Dealt With By Whoever Picked Up The Phone - No Transferring Between Departments Or Difficulties Because Calling Outside Office Hours. So Nice To Arrive And Not To Have To Go Through Any Lengthy Checking In Process - Were Just Taken Straight To Our Room.,,,,,,
,506,Only Negative Thing I Can Say Is To Suggest Is That Your Evening Dinner Menu In The Restaurant Appeal To A Wider Market. The Food Is A Work Of Art And It Is Clear That Your Chef Takes Pride In His Work But Some People Would Just Like A More Simple Fillet Of Beef And/Or Chicken Dish. We Stayed Recently For A Wedding Anniversary And Dined In The Restaurant But The Evening Didn't Go To Plan As There Were No Dishes That Appealed To Me So I Had To Ask For The Beef Dish To Be Cooked Differently And I Made It Clear That I Did Not Like Rare Beef. When My Meal Came It Was Pink And Rare So I Had To Send It Back. By The Time My Meal Came Back My Husband Had Finished His Dinner So We Did Not Get To Dine Together. The Restaurant Manager Dealt With This Situation In An Excellent Manner But It Could Have Been Avoided If There Were Just A Couple Of 'Simpler' Dishes On The Menu.,,,,,,
,509,No Comments As I Have Not Stayed.,,,,,,
,510,Room Was Ready Early Which Was Excellent. Also Your Check Out Time Of 1130 Is Fantastic. Means No Pressure.,,,,,,
,517,Telephoned Far Too Late To Be Informed That Kitchen Was Closed,,,,,,
,521,We Would Have Appreciated Warning That Our Room Was Up Three Flights Of Steepish Stairs. I Am A Reasonably Fit 83 But Found The Stairs A Struggle,,,,,,
,524,Very Prompt Reply Via Email When We Had Some Queries. Staff Very Polite Throughout Stay.,,,,,,
,532,The Young Lady On The Door  Im Sorry I Didnt Catch Her Name  Was Very Welcoming,,,,,,
,536,Poor Reception Staff At Checkout.,,,,,,
,540,Very Nice And Helpful Staff.  Wifi Very Weak. Had To Go To Another Location To Connect.,,,,,,
,543,Jessica Very Helpfull,,,,,,
,545,No Email Confirmation Of Dinner Booking Time As Requested But It Was Correct When We Arrived,,,,,,
,551,Excellent Service Throughout. I Was Booking A Group Stay For 4 Rooms/8 People For My Sister's 40Th Birthday.,,,,,,
,553,Every Member Of Staff Were Warm And Friendly. It Is Always Service With A Smile And A Chat.,,,,,,
,557,Daina (I Think That Was Her Name) Was Very Pleasant And Helpful ,,,,,,
,558,Just Thought The Carpet In The Restaurant A Little Loud And The Ornaments On The Shelves A Little Odd And Crowded.  Loved The Courtyard  The Food Etc...,,,,,,
,567,Reception Girls On Our Arrival Very Pleasant But Not Fully Conversant,,,,,,
,572,Room Was On The Top Floor Of The Adjoining House With Lots Of Stairs  Not A Problem For Us But Could Have Been And Maybe Worth Exploring/ Mentioning When Booking,,,,,,
,578,Very Friendly And Efficient,,,,,,
,581,Friendly Staff..,,,,,,
,582,We Had Asked For A Taxi To Be Booked To Take Us From The Station  And Despite Having This Confirmed By Email  No Taxi Was Booked And We Had To Wait At The Station For 20 Minutes Until A Replacement Could Be Ordered.,,,,,,
,584,Tried To Book On The Website Twice So Had To Phone In The End And Could Not Get The Date I Wanted,,,,,,
,585,Receptionist Was Extremely Helpful,,,,,,
,588,The Receptionist/Concierge On Duty On The 25Th And 26Th Was Unfailingly Courteous  Helpful And Welcoming - A Real Pro. She Had Arranged For Us To Have A Dog-Friendly Room Which Turned Out To Be Perfect.,,,,,,
,592,Everything Was Professionally Handled.,,,,,,
,599,The Lady That Booked Us In Was Very Polite But Did Not Seem To Know About The 4 Steps To Woodstock Which Included Afternoon Tea And Had To Check. I Showed Her My Email To Confrim This.  Only A Small Comment And It Did Not Spoil Anything.,,,,,,
,603,Bathroom -Only One Hook For Clothes; No Soap Dish ; Poor Light For Shaving With Only One Big Mirror,,,,,,
,609,All The Staff Were Very Helpful And Friendly,,,,,,
,611,Without Air Conditioning  It Was A Bit Warm For Our Taste (Being American)  But Was Still Lovely Overall.  The Only Issue We Had (Out Of Your Control) Was Contending With The Rowdy Bar Crowd Outside The Establishment Across The Street From Our Room  Since We Needed To Keep The Windows Open For The Cool Breeze. (Suite 5).,,,,,,
,613,No,,,,,,
,617,Peter Saunders Greeted Us Enthusiastically And Anticipated Our Every Need...And There Were Many Of Them.Returning Our Rental Car To Oxford  Figuring Out The Best Travel Option To Edinburgh  Bus Directions  Taxi Arrangements  Where To Eat  Etc. He Was Always Gracious  Never Lost Patience. We Loved Our Stay At Feathers And Peter Made Our Time There Very Special. We Would Recommend Feathers To Any Of Our Friends Visiting The Cotswolds. Warmly  Audrey And Harvey Scher,,,,,,
,618,Stairways Hard To Climb,,,,,,
,619,Being Shown To The Room Was Very Helpful,,,,,,
,620,None,,,,,,
,621,No,,,,,,
,628,Booking Was Very Easy And Prompt Confirmation,,,,,,
,632,2 Comments  1. I Booked Room 32 But Was Given Room 25 2. Ordered Extra Toast At Breakfast Which Never Arrived,,,,,,
,635,No Everything Was Fine As Always With 'The Feathers' Our Most Favourite Hotel!,,,,,,
,636,None,,,,,,
,644,Survey Loads So Slowly..Wasted 15 Mins So Far...Worst Part By Far!,,,,,,
,645,Parking Is The Only Drawback  Otherwise... Exceptional Service And Attention By Friendly Staff. Much Better Than Any Large Chain Of Hotels. Many Thanks.,,,,,,
,651,My Reservation Using Travelzoo Voucher Was Handled Well  Sometimes With Offers Such As This  When You Phone The Person Has No Knowledge Or Unsure What To Do  But Very Well Handled With Quick Follow Up E.Mail. On Arrival Check In And Short Tour A Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,652,Speed Of Email Query Return Was Good,,,,,,
,661,Very Friendly Receptionist (Morning Sunday 3 Nov).,,,,,,
,663,Excellent In Every Respect.,,,,,,
,668,The Room We Stayed In  Although Comfortable  Was Extremely Noisy. The Floor Upstairs Creaked And We Therefore Didn't Get Any Sleep.,,,,,,
,669,Very Friendly And Helpful But Initially Sent Wrong Details For Agreed Booking,,,,,,
,670,While The Reception/Restaurant Areas Were Very Pleasant  We Found The Colour Scheme Of The Room Rather Heavy And Dark.,,,,,,
,673,My Arrival And Pre Arrival Contact Was Really Stellar. Dana Was Amazing The Whole Way Through And Did An Amazing Pre Contact  Arranging So Many Things For Me And So Helpful. Also Jessica Helped Her  And Ana Was So Sweet And Helpful After My Arrival And During My Stay.,,,,,,
,677,Area Around Loo Smelled But Was Put Right Quickly,,,,,,
,678,My Partner Had A Specific Problem With Her Leg And Your Receptionist Was Extremely Helpful.,,,,,,
,680,Very Obliging Young Lady On Reception - Changed Our Room To Be On The Ground Floor To Help My Husband Who Is Having Difficulty With Stairs,,,,,,
,684,Poor Facilities-No Comfortable Lounge To Have Coffee And Meet Other Guests,,,,,,
,686,We Used A Travelzoo Voucher And We Were Very Impressed With The Way We Were Treated Just As Any Other Full Paying Guests...Brilliant.  Our Dog Was Taken Care Of In The Room With A Bed And A Bowl..Simple  But Effective! Ben Was Informative At Dinner And In The Gin Bar.  Lovely Place  Lovely Staff And Will Definately Recommend... Will Also Do A Tripadvisor For You.,,,,,,
,690,Very Good.,,,,,,
,692,I Was Disappointed That The Hotel Is Not Nearly As Attractive As It Was Several Years Ago When I Stayed.  At Least Window-Boxes On The Ground Floor And Something Around The Front Door Would Add To The Ambiance.  The Room  As Well  Could Be More Appealing Without The Ugly Blankets And Pink Clock That Was Incorrect.  Just By Adding More Attractive Features Would Improve Your Guests' Visits.  Don't Try To Be Modern Unless You Go All The Way.  Staff Was Very Pleasant  Including The Receptionist; However  She Must Learn To Multi-Task And Not Keep People Waiting For Long Periods Of Time While She Talks On The Phone Without Even Acknowledging Your Presence.  Normally I Do Not Submit Comments To Hotels  However  I Felt Let Down By The Changes Since By Last Visit  Admittedly Quite Some Time Ago.    Lenore E. Thornton,,,,,,
,696,The Response To The Chimney Fire Was Handled Well!,,,,,,
,698,When Initially Rang To Book The Wine And Dine Gourmet Evening I Was Told Sorry Fully Booked! I Queried This As I Had Rang Earlier And There Was A Few Rooms  The Chap I Spoke To Said Yes But The Restaurant Is Fully Booked!  This For Some Reason Didn't Ring True And I Was Correct As I Rang Back Later Still And Spoke To Rosie Who Said That Was Not The Case And So I Booked With Her. That Evening The Glass Shelf In En-Suite Fell Of Wall And Broke (Not Enough Screws Hokding It Up)  Door Handle Came Off When Member Of Staff First Took Us To Our Room And She Was Locked In With Us.  The Dinner Experience Was A Little Lacking In Atmosphere - Maybe Some Nice Background Music Would Add To This As Far Too Quiet.,,,,,,
,700,I Needed To Change The Reservation; The People I Spoke To Were Courteous And Efficient,,,,,,
,701,Great Staff And Very Relaxing Atmosphere.,,,,,,
,705,All My Contact Was Excellent,,,,,,
,706,A Drink On Arrival Would Be A Nice Touch,,,,,,
,707,Made To Feel Very Welcome,,,,,,
,710,I Called The Hotel To Book And No One Answered The Phone For Such A Long Time I Gave Up And Called The Next Day. Again There Was A Long Delay Before Someone Answered. On Arrival The Staff Were Very Welcoming And Efficient.,,,,,,
,719,Staff Were Very Helpful.,,,,,,
,723,The Is No Clear Pictures On The Website For The Room Types. I Was Disappointed With The Room And Bed We Had - Should There Have Been Pictures Or Better Room Descriptions On The Website - I Would Have Been Able To Choose Something More Suitable.,,,,,,
,724,Really Helpful Staff When I Contacted To Book. I Explained That My Uncle Had Problems With Steps Etc So A Ground Floor Room Was Provided Which Has Its Own Area To Sit Outside Which Was Ideal Considering The Weather. They Were Delighted With The Accomodation,,,,,,
,725,Thank You So Much For Making Our Stay Both Relaxing And Comfortable. The Room Was Great  Food Was Excellent And Pete And Jessica Were A Delight. Best Regards Matthew,,,,,,
,727,I Had Originally Called To Get Information On The Bistro Break Offer And Was Told There Was Plenty Of Availability On The Date That I Wanted.  Then When I Called Back To Book It (I Was Booking As A Surprise For My Boyfriends 40Th So Wanted To Check That I Could Get Him Off Work On The Monday Before Going Ahead With The Booking)  I Was Told That The Special Was No Longer Available Which I Was Very Disappointed About  However The Guy Who I Was Speaking To Was Kind Enough To Give Me The Deal And My Boyfriend Was Incredibly Happy With The Surprise.,,,,,,
,729,Fantastic Service,,,,,,
,735,This A Lovely Hotel  In A Beautiful Location. The Food Is Great.  The Style  Design And Facilities Are Very Good.  But What Lets This Place Down Is The Staff And The Administration. Whilst Everyone Is Friendly And Pleasant  No One Is Efficient  Professional Or Knowledgeable.,,,,,,
,742,No.,,,,,,
,743,I Asked Twice For A Letter/Email Of Confirmation But Did Not Receive One. Also  Curiously  I Was Reminded In Two Seperate Telephone Calls That My Daughter And I Could Actually Have Twin Beds Rather Than A Double Bed  As If I Was Completely Unaware Of That Possibility And Had Probably Just Landed From Another Planet. As I Was The  Customer They Should Have Realised That It Was Up To Me To Decide. They Both Tried In Their Own Quiet Way To Change My Mind And I Still Don't Know Why-Slightly Worrying.,,,,,,
,744,I Do Not Remember Receiving A Confirmation Of Booking Email/Letter Although I Asked Twice.,,,,,,
,751,We Are English But Work In Usa  We Came Over For The Battle Of The Proms  We Had Been Touring Uk  For Our Holiday  We Had The Family Room 2  Would Have Appreciated A Fan For Cool Air Though   The Staff Was Not Particularly Friendly  I Asked Did The Room Have A Hair Dryer  The Receptionist Did Not Know And Did Not Even Know Where In The Room There Would Be One. Did Not Have A Good Welcome. The Bottles Of Water In The Room Were Warm And One Which Should Have Been Fizzy Was Warm And Still. The Steps In That Family Room Are Dangerous  Fell On The Floor Because I Forgot There Was Some Steps  The Bath Rail Should Have Not Been On  It Was A Very Hot South Facing Room!!!!!! But The Breakfast Was Great  The Bed Was Comfortable Apart From The Bed Settee. A Nice Courtyard  But Noisey Due To Guests  If Young Children We  Would Not Stay With Young Children  And The Noise From The Ventilation At The Fire Exit End Was Too Loud For My Son To Get Off To Sleep. The Wardrobe Door Needs A Fix As It Swings Open And Hits You In The Head  Maybe A Fan And  A Fridge For Cold Water And Do Something About Those Dangerous Steps From The Bathroom It Could Be A Good Room. Needs Some Blinds To Keep Out The Hot Mid Day Sun On All The Windows.   ,,,,,,
,752,Very Good - Re-Confirmed My Reservation.,,,,,,
,754,Everything Was Perfect. We Only Stayed One Night But We Loved Every Second. A Beautiful Hotel.,,,,,,
,759,Pre Arrival Contact Re:Evening Menu Over 2 Evenings. We Felt We Should Have Been Told That The Taster Menu Was Virtually Identical To The A La Carte   So Gave Us A Poor Choice . Pre Arrival Contact Re:Parking Was Casual And We Had To Clarify Further On Arrival.,,,,,,
,761,All Good...  Very Nice,,,,,,
,762,Ac Would Be Nice  But I Stayed During A Heatwave!,,,,,,
,763,Staff Were Excellent As Always.,,,,,,
,771,The Smoking Fire The Whole Weekend Was Not Good. Had Problems Over My Wife Being Veggie.  Mentioned On Booking  Was Told All Fine.  Then Confirmation Email Asked About Dietary Needs  So Had To Reconfirm.  Then Got Call Saying Gin Experience Menu Had To Be Veggie For Both Of Us  So I Said Fine.  Asked Again At Dinner Whether We Both Wanted Veggie; When I Said I Would Prefer Not  I Was Given Non- Veggie.  I Was A Bit Confused And My Wife A Bit Embarrassed By Difficulty Of It All.,,,,,,
,788,The Staff Who Took The Booking Were Really Helpful And Accommodating.  They Were Knowledgeable And Courteous.,,,,,,
,791,We Had To Climb Some Floors To Our Room But It Was Worth It. ,,,,,,
,795,Courtesy Call Pre Check In Was Good,,,,,,
,796,No,,,,,,
,797,See Previous Comments,,,,,,
,798,Parking Is A Bit Hard But Overall Your Establishment Is Wonderful. I Will Write In Trip Advisor As Well. We'll See You Next Year.,,,,,,
,801,Wonderful All Round.,,,,,,
,804,Very Quick Service.,,,,,,
,805,Very Straight Forward,,,,,,
,806,The Young Ladies On Reception Were Excellent  Most Welcoming.,,,,,,
,807,No,,,,,,
,814,No More Comments  Thank You.,,,,,,
,815,It Was Odd That The Gas Man / Meter Man Took Priority Over A Paying Guest - Just Walking In Off The Street And Pulling Off The Receptionist Whilst I And My Partner Were Waiting To Check Out - But Apart From That Everything Was Up To Standard And Professional And Welcoming  Thank You,,,,,,
,821,See Earlier Comments,,,,,,
,823,Very Helpful Booking Arrangement Jessica Arranged Vip Passes At Bicester ,,,,,,
,826,It Was Good To Have A Call Prior To Our Arrival As Our Booking Was Via Internet It Gave The Personal Touch,,,,,,
,828,When I Called To Make A Booking  They Said Reception Was Busy And Asked Me To Call Back - If This Was My Business  I Would Make Sure That Potential Guests Are Called Back.   You Could Have Lost The Business.,,,,,,
,829,No It Was Fine For What We Paid  I Would Have Been Disappointed With The Experience If I Had Paid More Than £500. ,,,,,,
,832,We Thought The Hotel Information Done As A Paper Was A Very Good Touch. ,,,,,,
,836,Very Nice Lady Who Showed Us To Our Room. Very Helpful,,,,,,
,838,Happy With Everything - Thank You!,,,,,,
,841,Very Helpful & Professional... Happy To Move One Of The Staff Cars On Arrival So I Could Park. Nice Touch ,,,,,,
,843,Very Helpful In Booking And Check In,,,,,,
,846,Everything Was Really Professional And Welcoming. The Lady On Reception Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,847,Telephone Contact Re . Booking Dealt With Very Well!,,,,,,
,848,Upon Arrival We Were Made To Feel Very Relaxed  And Was Shown To Our Room Very Promptly.,,,,,,
,851,No Problems At All Everytime We Have Been  ,,,,,,
,852,Very Efficiently Dealt With Although There Were Some Problems With The Computer We Were Quickly Given The Keys To Our Room And Luggage Was Carried Up For Us.,,,,,,
,853,We Liked Most Of The Decor  But Felt The Lounge Was A Bit Dour And Would Benefit From A Warmer Refurb.,,,,,,
,854,Contact Was Informative   Helpful And Friendly,,,,,,
,858, Lovely Lady Handled The Process; She Seemed To Have A Lot On Her Plate With Multiple Entries / Exits And Dining Room Queries,,,,,,
,862,We Were Asked If We Needed Help With Luggage . We Said No But 3 Flights Of Stairs Later We Wished We Had Said Yes. The Receptionist Who Showed Us The Room Mentioned It Was An Upgrade . Compared To Our Previous Stay It Was Fairly Basic . No Information Was Offered Such As Breakfast Times. The Room Contained No Folder Of Local Information Or Hotel Facilities  Apart From Fire Instructions,,,,,,
,863,Would Advise Guests About The Parking Situation Before Arrival,,,,,,
,868,Free Parking Right Outside Was Useful,,,,,,
,869,Since I Was Coordinating Our Trip From The States  I Was On Email With Your Front Office Team Consistently.  Very Responsive And Accommodating With Our Needs....I Needed A Ground Floor Room For My Mother In Law  For Example  And It Was All Perfect When We Arrived.,,,,,,
,871,All Staff Were Very Helpful And Welcoming,,,,,,
,875,Efficient And Helpful.,,,,,,
,876,The Seats In Reception Are Right Next To The Door Making It Crowded And Cluttered. If You Arrive When Guests Are Leaving It Gets A Bit Much When You Have Luggage With You Too - I Would Recommend Having A Bit More Room To Enter And Exit The Hotel With The Reception Desk And Chairs Taking Less Room From The Passage Of People.,,,,,,
,881,Just That Loud Fan,,,,,,
,882,All Excellent.,,,,,,
,885,We Booked In On The Winter Warmer Package But When We Arrived Nothing Was Mentioned On This. We Were Supposed To Get Flask Of Coffee And Walking Guides Etc But Didn't  Although The Money For Dinner Was Removed From The Bill. ,,,,,,
,889,Needed To Be Warned About The Low Ceiling Outside Room 29  And As We Arrived In The Dark To Have The Fire Escape Mentioned. Diagram On Door Was Upside Down And Inaccurate.,,,,,,
,890,No,,,,,,
,891,No It Was All Fine - We Were Assisted With Our Luggage Which Was Important.,,,,,,
,892,It Was All Good!,,,,,,
,893,The Receptionist When We Checked In Was Very Friendly And Polite. The Receptionist On Our Departure Got The Bill Wrong But It Was Early Corrected. ,,,,,,
,894,Again  Much More Comprehensive Feedback In My Review On Trip Advisor. We Thought The Staff Were Welcoming  Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,,
,895,We Did Have A Few Problems With Making Our Booking  Including At One Point Being Sent A Confirmation At Double The Price That Had Been Quoted And Published.  All A Little Disconcerting But Eventually Sorted Out.,,,,,,
,904,Nice But Not A Special Welcome From Any Of The Staff.,,,,,,
,905,On Arrival We Were Shown To Our Suite But Were Given Information On Breakfast Times Or General Info. Asking If We'd Like A Morning Paper Might Also Have Been Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,906,Pre-Arrival - Staff Were Helpful And Pleasant As They Were On Arrival.,,,,,,
,907,Contacted Prior To Arrival To Confirm Our Booking And Ask Whether We Had Any Special Requirements.,,,,,,
,912,All Was Fine,,,,,,
,915,No.,,,,,,
,925,By Occupying Room 23 I Proved I Am Still More Physically Than I Thought I Was! Super Room  Access Difficult!,,,,,,
,927,Staff Efficient And Professional  Friendly But Not Over-Familiar,,,,,,
,928,Spotted Traffic Wardens Outside - Finding A Longer Period Space Can Be Frustrating,,,,,,
,929,No -  Very Friendly,,,,,,
,930,Pre Arrival Contact Was Made In Relation To Questions About Parking  Which Were Answered. The Welcome From Desk Staff And Other Staff Members Was Faultless. Thank You.,,,,,,
,932,On Arrival The Staff On Reception Were Very Helpful And Friendly But At First They Told Us To Go Through To The Bar Mistaking Us For An Afternoon Tea Booking Despite Being Given Our Amazon Voucher And Being Told That We Were Staying And Would Like To Go To Our Room.  However This Mistake Was Soon Rectified.,,,,,,
,933,I Was Passed Around Quite A Bit When I Called To Make My Booking Which Seemed Unnecessary But The Staff Were Friendly. Our Welcome On Arrival Was Good.,,,,,,
,934,Anna  The Receptionist Was Very Welcoming And Charming.,,,,,,
,937,Helpfully Changed Our Dates For Trip And Kindly Upgraded Our Room,,,,,,
,938,Most Welcoming,,,,,,
,939,We Have Visited The Feathers On Several Occasions And Always Look Forward To Our Return Visits.,,,,,,
,940,We Could Not Wish For A Better Stay.,,,,,,
,941,Reception Stay Were Lovely.,,,,,,
,943,On Arrival The Very Friendly And Helpful Receptionist Took Our Booking Paper And Put It Straight Into A Drawer.  With Surprise I Mentioned That We Would Like To Go To Our Room As We Were Staying Overnight.  She Ignored This And Told Us To Go Into The Bar!!  She Had Obviously Not Looked At The Paper And Took Us For An Afternoon Tea Booking.,,,,,,
,944,Always Polite And Friendly  Overall A Good Experience,,,,,,
,947,No,,,,,,
,949,Very Helpful Staff Who Did The Most Essential Thing First - Arranged For A Cup Of Tea! Well Done !,,,,,,
,952,No,,,,,,
,965,The Telephone Call To Confirm That We Were Still Coming Was Very Welcome  It Might Be A Good Idea To Explain The Parking Arrangements During This?,,,,,,
,968,Helpfully Moved Dates Of Reservation,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,,
,1,We Think That The Room Should Have Had A Tea Tray So That We Could Make Our Own Morning Tea. Ringing Down For Tea Might Be Acceptable At 5* Hotels In London  But It Feels Very Outdated In 2013 In Our View. We Do Know How To Make Our Own!,,,,,,
,2,Suite 5 - Truly Excellent. Beautifully Decorated And Very Comfortable Bed. Purely As Constructive Criticism  Bath Robes Would Have Been A Nice Additional Touch.,,,,,,
,6,The Bathroom Looked A Little Bare. For A Non Standard Room I Would Have Expected Dressing Gowns  Slippers And More Products.,,,,,,
,7,Disapointed There Was No Hospitality Tray- Its Great To Be Able To Make A Cup Of Tea Etc,,,,,,
,10,No Tea And Coffee Making Facilities That Were Complimentary,,,,,,
,11,Unfortunately There Was An Unpleasant Smell On The Landing Outside Of Our Bedroom.  It Was As If Someone Had Cleaned Using A Dirty Mop Or Cloth.  We Both Found It Rather Off-Putting On Arrival.  For This Reason I Can't Give You The Room Or Hotel Full Marks.,,,,,,
,12,A Little Dark.,,,,,,
,13,I Thought The Suite Of Rooms Was Very Expensive For What It Was - Basically A Small Corridor To The Toilet,,,,,,
,14,No Mini Bar - So No Wine Or Champagne Glasses In Room Asked For Ice Bucket And Got A Bucket With Water And 3 Ice Cubes In It,,,,,,
,18,Unfortunately The Inside Air Temperature Was Above 30C Which One Small Fan Could Do Nothing About.... Room 43 With Dsash Window As Wide As Possible Was Worse Than The Black Hole Of Calcutta (As Mentioned To Staff On Check-Out). This Is Unfortunate As In All Other Aspects The Hotel Was Excellent And Friendly,,,,,,
,22,There Was A 30Mm Tear In The Bottom Sheet  However This Was Minor For Us.,,,,,,
,27,28.  These Suggestions Would Take Our Experience From Good To Great.  The Ironing Board Being Removed Or At Least Put Away Following Our Room Being Cleaned.  Luxurious Bath Products Being Made Available  We Loved The Bath And Bathroom  Some Lovely Bubble Bath Would Have Made This Perfect.  Also Robe And Slippers Would Have Been A Nice Final Touch.,,,,,,
,31,Beautifully Appointed And Decorated  Impressed By The Size And Quality.,,,,,,
,32,The Suite Is Lovely - The Little Living Room Is Sweet But Sort Of Lacks Character A Bit.,,,,,,
,36,The Toilet Smelt Strongly If Urine.,,,,,,
,37,Room A Bit Dark. Though Room Could Be Brighter Paintwork,,,,,,
,39,Room42-Tap In Bathroom Very Noisy And Pressure Too High.,,,,,,
,40,Chair Ripped And Beams Were Dusty,,,,,,
,42,Room 33. The Refusal Of The 'Dressing-Table' Mirror To Remain Upright Detracts From The Appearance Of The Room.,,,,,,
,44,Room A Bit Dusty Around Tv With Glass Mark On The Glass Top To Tv. Body Lotion Would Have Been Good In The Bathroom To. When We Booked We Did Not Ask For The 'Disabled' Room And Would Really Have Preferred Not To Have That.  The Room Was However Fine And As It Was Only One Night Perfectly Adequate But Not Quite The Real Luxury What I Was Expecting.,,,,,,
,46,Unfortunately We Were In England During A Rare Heatwave.  As A Result We Found The Room A Little Warm.,,,,,,
,48,Room 43 - For The Price Paid There Should Be Tea/Coffee Facilities In Room. 2 Dirty Glasses Were Not Removed Or Replaced During Our 2 Nights Stay. A Dirty Tray Of Crockery Was Left Outside Suite Next To Our Room For 24 Hours.,,,,,,
,50,Room Was Quite Squashed  With 2 People In  One Of You Was Always In The Way.  Room Very Hot Even With The Window Open.,,,,,,
,51,Would Have Liked Tea/Coffee In Room  Room Far To Hot Even With Window Wide Open  No Means Of Cooling It Down.,,,,,,
,52,I Didn't Stay The Night Only Had Lunch,,,,,,
,53,The Room Was At The Top Of The Hotel And Not The Standard Of Room I Felt I Reserved.,,,,,,
,54,A Little Cold On Entry.,,,,,,
,56,I Was Surprised To Find That Tea/Coffee Making Facilities Were Not Provided. It Was Easy To Order Hot Drinks For Room-Service But The Convenience Of Being Able To Make Ones Own Was Missed.,,,,,,
,57,The Staff Offered Tea And Coffee In The Room But I Do Enjoy Having My Own Kettle So That I Can Have A Drink Whenever I Would Like.,,,,,,
,63,I Was Surprised To Be Given A Very Small Room Not In The Hotel But In A Dull  Drab Room On The Street Which Was Very Noisey. The Bed Was Not A Divan And Was Extremely Uncomfortable  The State Of The Bathroom Was Deplorable.,,,,,,
,65,Room 29  (Mallard) Lamp On Desk Needed The Bulb Changing  Not Working  And The Radiator In The Bedroom Was Only Just Warm.,,,,,,
,68,We Stayed In Room 42 And We Disappointed To Find That The Sheet On The Bed Had A Hole In And Was Stained. That,,,,,,
,69,It Was Shame There Were No Tea/Coffee Making Facilities In The Room (Which Considering The Cost Should Be Included). Also  There Was No Information Card/Booklet On The Hotel Telling Me About Breakfast/Check In Times Or Details Of What To Call For Reception. I Had To Call Reception Via My Own Mobile To Find Out Information! Plenty Of Info Re. The Local Area Was Available Though.,,,,,,
,70,Whilst We Appreciate The Building Is Very Old  The Furnishings In The Room Were Very Tired Looking And The Room Was Very Dark & Slightly Opressive. However  The Bed Linen Was Pristine And The Bed Itself  Very Comfortable,,,,,,
,72,Would Have Preferred To Stay In The Main Building,,,,,,
,73,There Were 3 Of Us In Suite Number 3 And I Got The 'Sofa Bed' - This Could Have Done With A Matress Topper As Really Quite Uncomfortable For An Adult. But Everything Else Just Lovely - A Real Home From Home.,,,,,,
,76,I Think I Was Suite 4.  It Was Very Hot And Wifi Very Patchy Which Isn't Great Nowadays And Considered Upacceptable By My International Delegates. Products In The Bathroom Have Disappontedly Changed To Something I Don't Recognise From Molton Brown.  They Are Not Replenished By Cleaning Staff When They Clean Each Day.  Ditto The Flannels  The Same One Is Left To Dry Out And No New Ones Put In - In 5 Days Of Staying There.,,,,,,
,77,Some Body Moisturiser Would Have Been Good,,,,,,
,78,The Room Was Charming Very Well Appointed. I Especially Liked The Selection Of Still And Sparkling Water.,,,,,,
,79,Suite 3: It Would Have Beem Convenient To Have A Free Plug Socket Near The Bed Or A Table For Phone Charging,,,,,,
,80,No  It Was Fine,,,,,,
,81,Suite 4. Excellent,,,,,,
,82,Room 43,,,,,,
,83,Room 43,,,,,,
,85,Loved The Bedside Light / Table Combo's,,,,,,
,86,The Room Was Ok  But I Would Not Describe It As 'Luxurious'.  Having To Walk Outside To Get To It Was Not Ideal  And In The Morning We Discovered That The Secondary Double Glazing Was Not Properly Closed On 3 Of The Panes  Letting Noise In Over-Night. The Turn-Down Service (If That's What It Was) Seemed Odd - On The First Night The Blanket On The Bed Was Removed  But Nothing Else Seemed To Have Been Done.  The Second Night Nothing Happened At All.  Only 1 Shower Gel Was Provided For 2 People For 2 Nights(!) And When The Toilet Roll Ran Out  The Spare Was Not Replaced.,,,,,,
,88,We Stayed With You For Three Nights During Which No Bathroom Products Were Replaced.  Also Would Strongly Suggest The Provision Of A Bath Mat For Use Whilst Showering As The Bath Was Very Slippery.,,,,,,
,89,All Good But Would Suggest A Bath Mat For Use In The Bath When Showering As Bath Was Very Slippery!,,,,,,
,90,We Were There For Three Nights  During This Time No Bathroom Products Were Replaced.,,,,,,
,93,It Was Too Hot During The Night!,,,,,,
,96,A Mini-Bar And Facilities For Making A Hot Drink Would Be Beneficial. The Bathroom Heating Was On In The Afternoon But It Was Cold In The Morning,,,,,,
,97,Upper Level Room. Rooms Were Quite Dark  It Was Very Hot And No Air Conditioning  One Sash Window To Let In Any Air. Had To Ask For A Fan. Which Was Provided.,,,,,,
,102,Would Have Liked Tea-Making Facilities In The Room And A Fridge.,,,,,,
,104,It Would Have Been Nice To Have A Kettle (For Hot Water And Hot Water Bottle!).,,,,,,
,105,Would Have Been Nice To Have Tea/Coffee Making Facilities.,,,,,,
,106,We Were Shown To Room 32 - Excellent. However  Due To An Awful Visiting Funfair We Had To Be Re-Assigned To A Quieter Room.  Room 14 Was A Lower Standard Room And Much Smaller.  Also  While We Could Not Hear The Funfair Noise There Was The Constant Humming From The Kitchen Fans  Just Beneath The Windows  Which Woke Me Up Early The Next Morning.,,,,,,
,107,The Room Layout Was Poor/Inefficient. The Bathrooom Ceiling Leaked And Flooded The Room.,,,,,,
,110,We Had Booked In As 3 People 2 Parents And Child And Provided With One Set Of Bath Products !,,,,,,
,111,We Stayed In The Courtyard Room. On Reflection I Would Prefer To Be In The Main Part Of The Hotel.,,,,,,
,117,Tea And Coffee Should Be Available In The Room.  Some Dust.,,,,,,
,120,Would Have Preferred To Have Tea And Coffee Making Facilities Within The Room,,,,,,
,121,Room 29 - A Very Long Climb To The Room  Fortunately We Are Reasonably Fit But Others Might Find It Difficult!      Also We Would Have Liked A Room Directory (As In Other Hotels) Giving Reception Phone Number And An Example Of Menus Available In The Restaurant.,,,,,,
,122,The Bathroom Was A Bit Of A Problem - The Plug In The Bath Had To Be Leavered Out The Next Morning By A Staff Member So That We Could Have A Shower.  Apparently A Known Problem.  The Curtain In The Bathroom Couldn't Be Closed  Which Was A Little Uncomfortable And Was Coming Off The Railing.  And The Table Lamp Wasn't Working Either And Nor Was It Fixed For The Second Night.,,,,,,
,125,We Had To Ask For Bathrobes Which We Had Expected To Find In Our Suite.,,,,,,
,126,It Was Dark And Rather Depressing. The Temperature Was Unbearably Hot.,,,,,,
,127,The Shower Head Needed To Be Cleaned.,,,,,,
,139,Room 43 The Bathroom Is Quite Small And Whilst Using The Wash Hand Basin The Bathroom Door Is Constantly Hitting You On The Back.,,,,,,
,140,We Were Given Very Top Of Hotel And Those Stairs Are Terrible,,,,,,
,141,Would Prefer To Have Been Told At The Time Of Makiong The Reservation That The Room Allocated Had A Disabled Ensuite,,,,,,
,143,A Lovely Room But Difficult For Both Of Us To Climb 2 Flights Of Awkward Stairs. Unfortunately The Ambience Of The Room Was Spoilt By The Droning Of The Extracter Fans From The Kitchen. We Were Told They Would Be Switched Off By Midnight But Sadly The Noise Continued All Night And I Hardly Slept - Even After Trying Earplugs !  Would Not Stay In Room 14 Again !,,,,,,
,144,Room 55: Stairs Awkward With Luggage,,,,,,
,145,Room 55: Stairs Quite Difficult With Luggage!,,,,,,
,146,It Was Incredibly Hot In Our Room - Had To Have The Window Open Which Meant We Heard All The Recycling Bins Being Picked Up Very Early In The Morning Which Was Very Loud!,,,,,,
,147,We Were Upgraded To Wren Suite Because There Had Been A Mix Up With The Superior Room We Had Booked.It Was A Nice Suite But I Would Have Been Disappointed If We Had Paid Top Rate For This Room.Thought The Lighting Was Insufficient And A Bit Gloomy And The Separate Lounge Area Was Not Particularly Welcoming. The Bathroom Was Very Nice But I Would Have Liked A Curtain On The Window As I Felt A Little Exposed When The Light Was On And Wasn't Entirely Sure If You Could See In From Outside. While The Room Was Very Clean  The Area  Between The Back Of The Toilet Seat And The Lid Was Dirty And I Found This Off Putting. I Would Have Liked To Have Completed A Customer Satisfaction Form But I Didn't Spot One In The Room.,,,,,,
,149,Having Seen The Photos Of The Rolltop Bath We Had Expected One And Was A Little Disappointed On Arrival But Our Room Was Lovely Still! We Were In Suite 2,,,,,,
,151,See My Comments Re Room14,,,,,,
,154,The Room Itself Was Good However As It Was Over The Reception. I Was Awoken At 6:30Am By The Reception Staff Either On The Phone Or Dealing With Other Staff.  So Great Hotel But It Really Depends On What Room You Get.  To Put It In Context  We Were Away For The Weekend Without Our Son For The First Time In 5 Years And Were Really Looking Forward To A Sleep In.  As It Ended Up We Were First To Breakfast And Probably First To Check Out.,,,,,,
,155,Suite 3. Weren't Expecting Suite Accommodation At Booking So Very Pleased To Stay In Suite 3! Beautiful Room.,,,,,,
,156,Suite 2. It Would Have Been Nice To Have Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room. Whilst Admittedly There Was The Option To Call Reception For Tea And Coffee To Be Brought To The Room  This Seemed A Long-Winded Solution To Get Get A Cup Of Tea.,,,,,,
,160,No Problem But Over Priced,,,,,,
,164,S5 It Was Very Hot!!!,,,,,,
,166,We Were In Room 4 And It Was A Warm Night So We Had The Windows Open.  Unfortunately It Rained So The Noise From The A44 Was Quite Loud - Not Your Fault  But Would Choose A Room At The Back If We Were To Stay Again And Would Recommend Our Friends To Do The Same,,,,,,
,170,Room 33 Is Quite Dark.  Only One Chair In The Room Which Forced One Of Us To Sit On The Bed.  No Seat To Do Make Up And Hair Next To A Mirror Or A Plug Socket For Hairdryer Or Straightners Next To A Mirror Or Seat.  Bathroom Also Not Natural Or Strong Lighting For Make Up Application.,,,,,,
,174,Surprised To Find No Coffee / Tea Making Facilities,,,,,,
,177,We Were A Family Of 4 In One Suite.  Our Bath And Shower Products Were Not Replenished For The 2Nd Day Of Our Stay.  This Appears Somewhat 'Cheap'.,,,,,,
,178,Noisy Water Pump In Bathroom,,,,,,
,179,The Room Was Lovely And Very Relaxing A King Size Bed Would Of Been Preferred As My Partner Is 6Ft 6 So The Bed Frame Was A Little Short,,,,,,
,180,Did Not Use The Accommodation Facilities. You Should Have A N/A Box On Many Of Your Scales.,,,,,,
,181,Suite 5 Bed Was Extremely Comfortable  Windows Very Drafty But Only To Be Expected Considering The Age Of The Property.,,,,,,
,183,My Husband And I Both Found The Room Very Nice But The Pillows Very Disappointing. At A Hotel Of This Standard We Would Always Expect Down Pillows - The Ones On The Bed Were Lumpy And Uncomfortable. We Should Have Asked If It Was Possible To Swap Them  But Didn't Bother In The End. Overall  This Was The Only Flaw In An Otherwise Excellent Visit.,,,,,,
,185,Our Room (25) Was Poorly Decorated And Had Very Tatty Furniture  It Did Not Have Any Infomation Avalible In The Room Ie  Room Service Details  Check Out Etc. No Tea And Coffee Facilities Were Avalible In The Room And We Were Not Told We Could Request Complimentary Tea/Coffee On Our Arrival. Our Phone Did Not Work When We Arrived   However It Was Fixed After Soon After We Reported It.,,,,,,
,186,You Choose Not To Provide Tea & Coffee  Preferring To Send This Up When Required. Our Order After Dinner Was Vey Slow 30Mins Requiring Me To Go Downstairs And Chase  Giving The Impression We Had Been Forgotten. Only Blip With Services But A Shame.,,,,,,
,187,Appeared A Little Warm On Arrival And Once Settled With A Welcoming Pot Of Tea  We  Were Unfortunately Evacuate Due To A Fire In The Hotel! After A Few Hours We Were Able To Return.   I Have To Mention The Extremely Comfortable Bed. We Did Regret That In The Short Time We Had There We Were Not Able To Take Full Advantage Of The Wonderfully Comfortable Bed; Which Was Pure Luxury (Due To The Evac).,,,,,,
,188,The Rooms Are Lovely  But I Would Not Consider Them Luxurious. The Twin Room Was Very Small.,,,,,,
,189,The Bedroom Was Poorly Lit,,,,,,
,190,It Would Be Good To Have The Option Of Tea Making Facilities Whilst There Was A Note Stating That Morning Coffee Was Available To All Guests We Would Have Preferred To Be Able To Make Our Own. In The Bathroom The Option Of A Shower Cap Would Have Been A Blessing.,,,,,,
,191,It's A Minor Thing  I Found The Room To Be Dark And I Prefer Well Lit Rooms.  The Black Lapshades  Don't Help.  I Also Thought The Choice Of Draperies In Suite 2  While Of High Quality  Made The Room Darker By Having Them Joined At The Top Instead Of Having 2 Panels That You Could Separate To Let In Maximum Light During The Day.  On A Repeat Trip I Would Probably Try A Different Room.,,,,,,
,192,Pieces Of Plaster And Paint On Top Of The Bed From The Ceiling  Throughout Early Evening There Was A Great Deal Of Noise/Jumping From The Room Above  Obviously Causing The Plaster On Ceiling To Fall Off. Tea Making Facilities Would Have Been Nice  We Were Offered A Cup Of Tea And Then Charged Â£4 Per Cup For It!,,,,,,
,193,Room 32 - Overall Really Liked It,,,,,,
,194,Beautifully Set And And Scrupulously Clean!,,,,,,
,198,Suite 2  We Were Very Happy To Be Upgraded To This Lovely Suite And It Was Beautifully Clean  Spotless  I Liked The Fact That Your Toiletries Smelt Nice  We Go Away A Lot And They're Usually Always A Very Masculine Scent But Yours Were Nice And Both Me And My Husband Were Happy To Use Them.,,,,,,
,199,Suite 1 The Water Stopped While I Was In The Shower And I Had To Rinse Shampoo Off My Hair In The Sink But Only Boiling Hot Water Was Coming Out. We Were Given Another Room But Nobody Offered To Help Us Move Our Things Which We Had Unpacked. There Is No Kettle In The Room Which Is A Basic Facility ,,,,,,
,204,It Was Extremely Hot Overnight Despite Having The Window Open.Also It Was Noisy With A Lot Of Door Banging About 11.30Pm  Not Sure If This Was Staff Going Through One Of The Private Doors Nearby Or Just Finishing Up For The Night.,,,,,,
,207,29. Tea Making Facilities Should Be In Superior Rooms.,,,,,,
,208,The Bathroom Seemed Quite Cold,,,,,,
,212,The Water Pump Woke Us Up At 7Am And Was Very Disruptive. I Am Heavily Pregnant And Came To The Feathers To Relax And Catch Up On Rest  So This Was Far From Ideal.,,,,,,
,214,42 Exceptional Amount Of Dust Around Scrolls On Furniture. Bathroom  Hand Basin Tap Difficult To Use Without Splashing Water Everywhere.,,,,,,
,215,51 Very Lovely Room,,,,,,
,216,Initially Thought That The Relatively Noisy Ventilation Unit/Extractor Outside Our Room Would Be An Issue  But In The End It Didn't Bother Us. Lovely Room Otherwise.,,,,,,
,217,Suite 3 - Room Was Fine  Bathroom Walls Above The Door Were Dusty. Room Serviced On First Day But No Toiletries Replaced - We Called Reception And They Were Sent Up,,,,,,
,220,4Foot 6Inch Bed Too Small,,,,,,
,222,The Furniture Was Covered In Dust And The Mirrors Left A Lot To Be Desired.,,,,,,
,229,Would Have Appreciated Being Able To Make Tea And Coffee In The Room.,,,,,,
,232,The Bedroom Was Really Hot - We Opened Windows But If You Ever Consider Aircon In The Rooms This Would Be Of Great Benefit.,,,,,,
,233,No,,,,,,
,235,We Stayed In Room 25.  We Liked The Large Bed That Was Very Comfortable.  The Bathroom Was A Bit Small But Well Appointed.  Bath And Shower Excellent.  The Room Was Rather Warm But There Was A Fan Available If We Needed It.  We Were Woken Up Very Early Morning By The Bin Men But It Didn't Spoil Our Stay.,,,,,,
,236,Cobwebs Hanging From The Ceiling Over The Window.  Cobwebs In Window And Coving Over The Door.  Thick Dust On Top Of The Curtains. Bath Had Water In It As Taps Not Able To Be Closed Off Properly.  Childs Medication Left On Mantlepiece Of Fire.  Long Hairs On The Duvet.  Only One Chair To Sit And Relax!  Light In Wardrobe Not Working.  We Found The Bed Uncomfortable And Too Small For A Superior Room.  Pillows Were Too Small And Lumpy And Not Comfortable.  Sparkling Water Had Been Opened And Was Flat.,,,,,,
,239,This Is The Only Hotel I Have Stayed In Which Did Not Provide Free Tea/Coffee Facilities Within The Room And The Absence Of A Mini Bar/Fridge. There Was No Bubble Bath For The Bath  Only Shower Gel.,,,,,,
,244,There Was No Shampoo Provided.  Only Shower Gel And Bubble Bath.,,,,,,
,247,The Mattress On The Bed Was So Uncomfortable That We Both Awoke With Sore Backs.  We Were Awake At 7Am As The People Above Us Were Moving Around The Room A Great Deal And The Ceilings Were Really Creaky!  It Is An Old Building  So Doubt You Can Do Much About That But Definitely Time To Change The Mattress.  We Were Staying In The Ground Floor Outbuilding With The Disabled Access Wet Room.,,,,,,
,248,25 We Would Have Liked Tea Making Facilities. The Jelly Beans Were A Nice Touch  But If Left In The Jar For Any Length Of Time They Do Stick Together And Are Not Accessible. It Would Be A Good Idea To Empty And Refill For Each Booking So That This Does Not Happen.,,,,,,
,253,Suite 3. I Found The Hot Towel Rails Were Unfortunately Far Too High To Be Of Any Use For More Than One Towel,,,,,,
,256,We Would Have Liked A Larger Bed,,,,,,
,257,25 Wifi Would Be A Nice Feature In The Room.,,,,,,
,259,Suite 1. No Hand Cream Or Shower Cap! Sorry To Be Picky!,,,,,,
,263,Bathroom Very Clean. Room A Little Dark.,,,,,,
,264,I Made The Point When We Left That The Hot Water System Had Struggled With The Very Cold Weather To Provide A Hot Bath - It Was Ok In The Basin - And Double-Glazing Might Have Been A Plus!,,,,,,
,265,I Would Have Liked A Shower Cap.  Also  On Of The Blinds Was Broken So It Had To Remain Down All The Time.,,,,,,
,266,We Were In Room 42 And It Was Quite Dark  As There Was Only A Relatively Small Window. Not Much You Can Do With The Room Configuration  But We Prefer Brighter Rooms.,,,,,,
,269,The Ipod Doc On The Bedside Table Did Not Appear To Work. We Did Not Mention It At The Time As It Wasn't Important To Us. The Bottle Collection On The Weds Morning Was Noisy But That Can't Really Be Avoided.,,,,,,
,271,Bed Not As Comfortable As Others In Similar Hotels,,,,,,
,276,Room Was Well Appointed  Comfortable And Clean Although No Coffee / Tea Making Facilities Were Available In The Room.,,,,,,
,277,I Had Read Reports From Customers Who Said They Loved The Jelly Beans In Their Rooms So Dissapointed We Did Not Get Any.,,,,,,
,278,Room Number 32 There Was No Tea Or Coffee Making Facilities However Everything Else Was Excellent,,,,,,
,282,First Room We We're Put In Very Dark And Drab  Up On The Third Floor   Ask To Be Moved   Went To Room 28 Much Better But Bathroom Needed Attention Peeling Paint Work Around Shower   Toilet Seat Stained And Needed Replacing And Two Towel Rails Which Didn't Work  Dressing Table Mirror Needed Repair As It Wouldn't Stay Upright   Do You Not Have A Housekeeper Checking These Things? We Booked On A Sunday Evening Thinking We Would Get A Decent Room   But So Disappointed .,,,,,,
,283,Would Of Liked Hot Drink Making Facilities .,,,,,,
,284,Tea Making Facilities Would Have Been Appreciated,,,,,,
,286,It Was Lovely And The Bottles Of Water And Jelly Beans Were A Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,288,Room Was Very Basic  No Bedside Tables Or Lamps  No Tea/Coffee In Room  Noise From Aircon Units Below  Bed Not Very Comfortable. When I Called For Coffee Sunday Morning It Took 3 Minutes For The Phone To Be Answered,,,,,,
,292,No Coffie Or Tea Im Room,,,,,,
,293,It Was A Sunny Day And The Room Had Become Far Too Hot. Fortunately The Window Opened. However  The Towel Rail In The Bathroom Was Fully On And Seemed Impossible To Turn Down.,,,,,,
,294,Too Amall,,,,,,
,295,Room 24 Stairs Difficult To Negotiate For Elderly,,,,,,
,296,Pre Warn Guests About Location Of Room At App Of House In Case Of Mobility Issues,,,,,,
,297,We Bought Some Friends With Us And Their Room Needed A Chair At The Dressing Table But Otherwise Everything Was O.K.,,,,,,
,302,Oops I Have Already Commented About That!  The Room Was Cleaned But There Were Stains On The Carpet And The Shower Screen In The Bathroom Needed Attention.  The Rubber Seal Needs Replacing.  I Turned The Shower On And Went Back In To Find Water Running Out Onto The Floor.,,,,,,
,303,There Wasn't Any Lotion In Our Room And I Had To Request It.,,,,,,
,305,The Bedside Lamps In Room 25 Are Dangerous. I Toppled One Full Onto My Head  In The Dark  In The Middle Of The Night. My Wife Thought That The Pillows Were Too Soft But Its Personal Opinion.,,,,,,
,310,The Plug In The Bath Didnt Work So We Weren't Able To Use The Bath Which Was A Disappointment.,,,,,,
,312,The Switches For All 3 Table Lamps Were Too Low Down On The Flex.  On The Desk I Had To Crawl Under The Desk To Switch The Light On.  An Electrician Could Move The Switches Nearer To Base Of The Lamp On The Same Flex,,,,,,
,316,Although Clean I Thought That It Was Rather Shabby. One Particularly Small Round Table Needed Attention.  The Bathroom Was Pleasant And I Appreciated The Generous Amount Of Towels Provided.,,,,,,
,317,We Were Given Suite 4 Which Was Fabulous My Partner Likes To Make Her Own Tea. No Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,322,It Would Of Been Nice To Of Had Tea Making Facilities  But Loved The Room,,,,,,
,326,The Armchair Was Wonderfully Comfortable. Two Would Be Better In A Double Room Though.,,,,,,
,328,Lovely - Warm  Stylish  Comfortable. We Had Only 1 Of Everything Of The Products Which Was Less Useful When I Wanted A Bath On The Evening Of Check-In And We Each Had A Shower The Following Morning - We Had Brought Extra Supplies With Us - But Had We Not We Would Have Felt Perfectly Comfortable Asking For More Supplies.,,,,,,
,329,No Tea Making Facility And Could Of Had More Luxurious Bath Room Products Wardrobe Door Difficult To Close. Plus Points Bath Robes Plenty Of Towels And Bed Very Comfortable,,,,,,
,334,Suite 2. My Only Grip Is The Light Intrusion Into The Room  From The Large Gap Under The Door (I Had To Place A Towel On The Floor Against The Door  The Very Bright Standby On The Tv (I Had To Hang A Coat Over The Tv To Cover It And The Glow Coming From The Emergency Escape Sign In The Sitting Room Which I Guess We Have To Live With. It Would Have Been Nice To Have Beverage Facilities In The Room Without Relying On Room Service.,,,,,,
,335,The Room Was Quite Warm. We Opened The Windows But The 'Kitchen Noise 'Woke Us Early Morning.,,,,,,
,338,42 Is A Dark  Gloomy  Poorly-Lit Room. The Bathroom Was Inconvenient  And The Shower Controls Were Confusing.,,,,,,
,340,The Climb Up The Stairs Was A Surprise  We Were More Than Able To Deal With It But If We Had Been Older  Whether Or Not Infirm  It Could Have Been An Issue.  Also Where Ever We Go We Think Could We Have Taken Our Parents And On This Occasion  In This Room The Answer Would Have Been No.  Thats Not A Problem But We Would Have Wanted To Be Aware Of That When Booking.,,,,,,
,341,Suite 5.   The Room Was Not Cleaned Upon Arrival.  We Found A Dirty Towel On The Floor When We Were Shown To The Room.  There Was Evidence Of The Previous Occupant In The Shower  Grit At The Bottom Of The Bathtub  Smears On The Mirror And The Bed Side Cabinets Were Dirty Also.  The Room Was Re-Cleaned   However Even After That We Found Lipstick Marks On The Glasses And Had To Ask For Replacements. Also  When I Moved The Lamp There Was A Black Line Of Dirt Across The Bedside Table  Very Disappointing And Not Acceptable For The Price We Paid.  There Were Lovely Temple Spa Products   But Not Enough Of Them.,,,,,,
,343,I Slept Well,,,,,,
,344,Actually Two Issues. The Amin Issue Was The Location Of The Room Itself (51) On The Ground Floor  At Street Level  Looking Directly Out Onto The Street. I Like To Change My Clothes And Go Out Jogging But Felt Very Inhibited By Having To Strip Off In Full Public View And Net Curtains Are Just Not Opaque Enough.  Second  The Remote Control For The Television Did Not Work.,,,,,,
,347,Room Was Very Cold And No Means Of Controlling The Temperature. Needed An Extra Duvet.,,,,,,
,348,Unfortunately The Bath Plug Was Faulty And The Shower Seemed Blocked At The Tray Filled Up,,,,,,
,350,Suite 4. We Loved The Suite. We Only Wished We Had Book A Longer Stay  To Enjoy The Room More.,,,,,,
,352,Foot Stool Was Filthy!,,,,,,
,353,The Footstool In Bedroom Was Filthy  Not Hoovered At All.,,,,,,
,354,Very Warm Overnight  Even With A Fan (Suite 1).  Would Be A Struggle In The Height Of Summer,,,,,,
,356,No Large Mirror In Bathroom. No Tea And Coffee In Room,,,,,,
,360,Think It Was Room 23.  Disappointingly Small Room And Dark.  Wardrobe Was Abysmal.  Very Cold When We Arrived.,,,,,,
,361,The Lighting Wasnt Great In The Lounge Area Of Suite 2 And We Were Woken At 545Am By Noisy People (Staff?) Who Sounded Like They Were Moving A Beer Barrel,,,,,,
,362,I Have Stayed In The Feathers Many Times Over The Years  But Not Since Your Refurbishment.  These Things Are Very Much A Personal Taste  But I Felt The Facelift Has Lost The Heart Of The Hotel,,,,,,
,365,We Were Located In The Ground Floor Room At The Rear Of The Courtyad And Were A Little Dissapointed There Was No Bath.,,,,,,
,366,Some Cobwebs Visible Above The Bed. Room 25,,,,,,
,369,We Stayed In The Eagle Suite.  We Were Surprised That There Were No Tea/Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.,,,,,,
,370,32 Bedside Lighting Very Difficult To Read By.,,,,,,
,371,Only The Stairs Getting To The Room. The Lady Showing Us To The Room Did Offer A Lower Room But We Declined.,,,,,,
,372,Room 33.  Perhaps A Little Dark  With The Curtains Covering Much Of The Window.  We Also Thought The Bathroom Decor Was Rather Monochrome.,,,,,,
,374,We Really Liked The Separate Sitting Room.,,,,,,
,375,Would Have Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,376,The Blind To The Rear Window Was Left Down As Broken  Therefore Rather Dark. The Room Was Rather Quaint But Acess Was Difficult For 'Mature' People And We Were Not Advised In Advance,,,,,,
,377,Disappointed In Our Room And Found The Bed Small And Not Comfortable Courtyard Room,,,,,,
,380,No Bubble Bath Available.,,,,,,
,382,Room 42 Bad Points: Would Have Liked Some Coffee / Tea Making Facility In Room. The Tap In The Bathroom Was Very Fierce And Sprayed Water All Over You Each Time You Turned It On.,,,,,,
,384,No,,,,,,
,385,Room 33 . Bed Very Comfortable. Would Like To Know The Mattress Type And Brand.,,,,,,
,386,I Wanted Some More Shampoo And Conditioner And I Had To Ask Multiple Times.,,,,,,
,389,As Previously Stated. Soft Furnishings Very Nice And Comfy Bed.,,,,,,
,391,Air Conditioning Needed Desperately In Warm Weather As The Rooms Become Very Stuffy,,,,,,
,392,24. Very Wobbly Headboard - Could Not Move At All Without It Banging On The Wall Behind The Bed.,,,,,,
,395,The Room Was Very Hot And Uncomfortable During This Hot Weather - Perhaps Some Air-Conditioning Should Be Considered?,,,,,,
,396,It Was Too Hot  Unbearable,,,,,,
,401,Cover The Hot Water Pipe In The Floor. Bathroom Excellent When You Figure Out How The Shower Works.,,,,,,
,402,Very Comfortable!,,,,,,
,405,The First Night Was In The Courtyard Room Designed For People With Disabilities And Frankly Disappointing. The Second Night We Were Upgraded To Suite 5 Which Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,409,Room32  Would Have Liked To Have The Facilities Of Tea/Coffee   When Reading The Comments In The Guest Book  Quite A Few Previous Guest Also Made This Comments  Being An Early Riser Would Have Appreciated This  ,,,,,,
,412,The Room Was Extremely Hot. We Had A Fan But This Did Little To Cool The Room. We Stayed During The Recent Really Hot Weather So There Isn't Much Else That Could Have Been Done. Also  Would Be Nice To Have Tea/Coffee Making Facilities.,,,,,,
,413,Room 28  Sash Windows Don't Close Tight  Creating A Draft  Curtains Don't Close Tight Meaning Room Is Very Light.  Extractor Fan In Bathroom Very Loud.,,,,,,
,414,51 I Would Have Expected Bath Robes In A Hotel Such As This,,,,,,
,415,We Loved The Design Of Our Room  However There Were Minor Points That Made It Appear Less Luxurious  In Our Opinion. Those In Questions Are The Pink Alarm Clock With An Ipod Speaker  Gigantic Lamps And Standing Shower That Does Not Drain. In Addition  One Of The Windows Did Not Have A Lock.,,,,,,
,416,Suite 1. Great. Upgraded From A Cotswold Double,,,,,,
,417,Would Have Liked Tea/Coffee Making Facility,,,,,,
,418,A Couple Of Comments About The Room.  We Stayed In The Annex  And Although The Bathroom Was Very Well Decorated It Was  Frankly  Too Small And Cramped And Not What You Would Expect When Paying A Relatively High Price For The Room Secondly  The Absence Of Corporate Feel Was Good  Up To A Point.  However  Not Supplying Tea Making Facilities Was A Mistake. You 'Lost Points' For That.,,,,,,
,421,I Would Have Preferred To Have Had A Room With A Bath.,,,,,,
,422,There Was No Bath.,,,,,,
,428,I Wouldn't Describe It As Luxurious Butit Was Very Nice - Apart From Being Next To A Staircase And Front Door So Had The Upstairs Guests Tramping Upstairs/Downstairs Which Was Very Noisy.,,,,,,
,429,Room In The House Next Door  Just Inside The Front Door  Left.  Sorry Cant Remember The Number.,,,,,,
,434,Room 51 Would Have Prefered A 1St Floor Room. No Tea & Coffee Making Facliaties In The Room,,,,,,
,435,We Stayed With You Before In May 2012 And Had A Fabulous Time  Everything Was Just Perfect And That Is Why We Came Back Again  But This Time We Were Far From Impressed.  We Stayed In Room 14  Where The Bathroom Had Been Shoe-Horned In And The Toilet Seat Was Badly Cracked Which Is Not Only Very Unhygienic But Also Very Uncomfortable As It Pinches Your Flesh When Sitting On It.  There Are No Bedside Tables  To Put Our Water Or Drinks On.  We Ordered Tea To Be Brought To Our Room For 7.00 A.M. And Rang Reception At 7.20 And Nobody Answered The Phone So Had To Ring Again At 7.30 As Still  Nothing Had Been Delivered And Were Told There Was Only 1 Member Of Staff In The Restaurant And They Were Busy.  I Fail To See Why Tee/Coffee Making Facilities Cannot Be Provided In The Rooms.,,,,,,
,436,33 - We Would Like To Have Tea/Coffee Making Facilities In The Room And A Second Chair Would Have Made The Room More Comfortable.,,,,,,
,441,We Stayed In Room 52 And This Was Perfect As We Had Our Labrador With Us....And We Loved The Patio Area!,,,,,,
,442,Room 51  Shame About The Staircase Leading To Upstairs  As All Movement Was Clearly Heard  Although It Is Appreciated That In Older Buildings  This Would Be Difficult To Improve.,,,,,,
,443,It Was Suite 3. It Was Fine - Again We Stay In Amazing Hotels So I Expect A High Standard. Would Have Liked Tea And Coffee In The Room. For A Suite You Might Consider Upgrading To Better Toiletries?,,,,,,
,444,No Bubbles For The Lovely Bath - Just Shower Gel - Not The Same!!,,,,,,
,447,No Bedside Tables To Put A Night Time Water On. Also One Of The Bottles Of Complimentary Water Was Labelled Still Yet Was Carbonated.,,,,,,
,449,Suite 1 1. We Weren't Able To Watch One Of The Dvd's We Borrowed As I Couldn't Change The Channel On The Tv To The Hdmi Av Input - The 'Tv/Av' Button Simply Didn't Work! I Tried All Manor Of Things But Eventually Had To Give Up. I Might Have Been A Numpty And Pressed All The Wrong Buttons But Consider Myself Reasonably Tech Savvy So Sincerely Hope This Wasn't The Case.   2. The Extractor Fan In The Bathroom Was Particularly Noisy  Probably Just Needs A Clean But Either Way It Certainly Didn't Contribute To A Nice Relaxing Soak In The Bath!,,,,,,
,451,Suite 1 - The Shower Was Rather Weak. Would Have Expected A Power Shower At This Standard Of Hotel.,,,,,,
,452,Our Bedroom Was Fine But Our Friends In 24 Had No Cross Ventilation And It Was Very Hot. The Rooms 23 And 24 Were Nice But Very Expensive For Their Size.,,,,,,
,453,A Pile Of Dirty Towels Had Been Left On The Chair When We Came Back To Our Room In The Evening,,,,,,
,455,Heated Towel Rail Not Working No Shower Gel Or Shampoo Just Soap Staff Getting Up At 6.00Am Noisy And Woke Us Up Only One Dressing Gown Which Was Too Small,,,,,,
,458,The Water In Our Room Wasn't Hot When I Complained To Reception They Upgraded Us To A Suite With No Quibble Excellent Service,,,,,,
,467,The Bath Wasnt Perfectly Clean But The Most Disappointing Were The Products For Going Away Means A Relaxing Bath With Nice Products Which I Expect A Hotel Like Yours To Provide. You Have A Good Brand In The Ladies Room In The Restaurant And I Think They Should Be In The Rooms.Secondly We Had A Real Problem With The Bed  Every Time You Moved It Made A Noise We Reported It In The Morning And I Do Hope You Look Into That Because It Would Put Us Off Returning,,,,,,
,474,Partridge  I Think.  It Would Be Nice To Be Able To Blow Dry Hair In Front Of A Well Lit Mirror.,,,,,,
,477,We Stayed In Suite 3 - Unfortunately As A Result Of Your Kitchen Staff Talking Until 11.30Pm And A Piece Of Black Metal Sheet Near The Fire Escape Banged All Night (Because It Was Windy) The Person Sleeping On The Sofa Bed Did Not Sleep At All Well.,,,,,,
,478,No,,,,,,
,481,Generally Very Clean! But On Entering The Room You Foul See That Under The Bed Was A Layer Of Dust.,,,,,,
,482,There Was Some Dust Under The Bed On Entering The Room  However  Very Good Otherwise.,,,,,,
,486,Too Hot - And We Had Difficulty Turning Off The Bathroom Radiator,,,,,,
,489,Tiny Bit Small With Extra Bed In And Because Of Hot Weather We Needed The Windows Open So Collection Of Bottles Early On Wed Morning Was Very Noisy,,,,,,
,493,Suite 1. Sympathetically Decorated - Extremely Nice!,,,,,,
,494,Our Dog Was Chuffed That She Even Had Her Own Bed - We Needn't Have Brought Hers !!,,,,,,
,498,The Room Did Not Have A View - Overlooked Working Areas,,,,,,
,500,Stayed In Room 43  Bathroom V Compact.Room On A Slant And Bed Rather Uncomfortable.,,,,,,
,502,Wi Fi Access In The Rooms Please,,,,,,
,506,We Stayed In Suite 3 And It Was Wonderful. Lovely Soft Bedding And Lots Of Space To Relax.,,,,,,
,511,I Found Someone Else's Hair In Bathroom And I Think The One Bathrobe Had Been Used .,,,,,,
,512,29 Mallard. This Is An Honest Account And I Hope It Helps. I Will Not Put This On Tripadvisor. Dusty Mirror  No Wine Glasses Or Fridge And It Would Have Been Nice To Have Drinks Making Facilities In The Room. Our Room Was In The Roof And Was Very Hot So Air Con Would Have Been A Big Plus. Only One Robe Was Provided And The Roman Blind In The Bathroom Was A Bit Difficult To Close. The Bed Was Massive And Really Comfortable. The Ensuite Was Clean And Modern With A Good Shower. The Toiletries Were A Nice Touch And Smelt Lovely. Most Of All The Interior Was Modern And Luxurious Which Appealed To Us. We Had A Pleasant Stay.,,,,,,
,516,Suit 1 Far Too Hot During This Hot Spell Needed Fan In Room,,,,,,
,519,We Were Not Really Expecting To Be Put In Room 52 Which Is Kitted Out For The Disabled.  It Was A Nice Room But It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Bath And The Toilet Was A Little High.,,,,,,
,520,25 The Room Was On A Slope So Not Pleasant For Sleeping And Generally Felt Disorientating. It Would Have Been Better If Tea And Coffee Facilities Were Available In The Room. The Room Was Also Extremely Hot Even When The Towel Heater Was Turned Off.,,,,,,
,523,Suite 3 - We Were Upgraded And Thought It Was A Beautiful Room,,,,,,
,526,We Would Have Really Valued Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.  As Someone Who Routinely Wakes Up At 5.30Am  I Would Clearly Not Ask A Member Of Staff To Provide Tea Or Coffee.,,,,,,
,529,Bathroom Very Hot,,,,,,
,531,Mallard Room- Lots Of Loud Strange Noises On Arrival Which Sounded As If In Th Hotel (As If Plumbing/Sawing) But It Stopped Before We Got Back From Dinner.,,,,,,
,532,Not Very Clear On How To Work The Dvd Player But Im Sure Someone With Knowledge Would Be Fine,,,,,,
,534,Suite 4   Room Extremely Hot At Night.,,,,,,
,537,The Bathroom Products Were Not Replaced Each Day,,,,,,
,545,Easier To Have Tea And Coffee Making In Room With Biscuits.....Gives More Flexibility.,,,,,,
,548,I Completely Appreciate That I Booked A Mid Week Break At A Very Reasonable Price So Thought The Room Would Be One Of Your Smaller Ones. It Was Very Small... But Very Nice,,,,,,
,549,Suite 2 - The Room Was Lovely And Warm  But The Bathroom Was Chilly All The Time Even Though The Towel Rail Was Hot.,,,,,,
,551,More Than One Bath/Shower Gel Would Be Helpful Although I Am Sure This Would've Been Provided If I Had Asked.,,,,,,
,553,We Were Upgraded To Suite 5 As We Did Not Want To Stay In The Annex. On Seeing Our Dissapointment We  Were Happily Offered  The Alternative Room Which Was Really Super. It Was A Lovely Treat But I Must Stress That All The Rooms Are Very Nice.,,,,,,
,554,Room 51 : The Creaking Staircase On The Bed Head Wall Caused Considerable Disturbance From Other Guests Using The Stairs (I At First Thought A Small Troupe Of Tap Dancing Elephants Were Practicing Next Door) Especially From 6Am On The Day Of Our Departure. If Sound Proofing Cannot Be Arranged Maybe A Note Could Be Left In The Rooms Above Requesting Consideration For Other Guests.,,,,,,
,557,Room 32 The Room Was Very Clean Nice Comfy Bed  We Just Found The Room Very Dark (Quite Depressing) We Do Understand That It's An Old Building Ect But Maybe Brighter Curtains And Decor Would Help ,,,,,,
,558,The Room Was Clean  However The Dressing Table/Mirror Area Was Quite Dusty  But Overall Really Impressed.,,,,,,
,559,The Room Was A Bit Tired  Shower Fittings Lose  Drafty Windows And Little Sound Proofing Between Floors And Rooms.,,,,,,
,561,Can Hear The Other Guests In Their Room Clearly.,,,,,,
,564,Room Was Quite Depressing And In Desperate Need Of Redecoration And Paintwork Really Dirty.  Not Nice Room At All  Looked Like An Old Granny's Guest Room.,,,,,,
,567,The First Room Which We Were Given(Swan) Was Dark And Miserable  Ie  A New Colour Scheme Would Help  Look At The Room From The Bed And Not The Door And You Will See What I Mean. The Second Room We Were Given After Complaining (24) Was Fine Even Though The Wall Paper Was Rather Overpowering! Need A New Designer Perhaps  However The Tiling In Bathrooms Was Second To None.,,,,,,
,571,A Little Dark.,,,,,,
,572,Room Was Extremely Hot  The Fan Provided Helped But There Seemed To Be Little Air Circulating. Top Floor Rooms Need Enhanced Cooling/ Additional Or Stronger Fans In Hot Weather.,,,,,,
,573,Aylesbury We Found The Room Very Hot During The Night But Noisy When We Opened The Window And Had Difficulty With The Blind In The Bathroom So Consequently Didn't Get A Good Night's Sleep.  We Appreciated The Bottles Of Water In The Bedroom But Would Have Liked Facilities To Make A Hot Drink And There Was Only 1 Bath Robe And I Couldn't Work Out At First How To Run A Hot Bath!,,,,,,
,575,Bedside Lamps Did Not Give Enough Light For Reading Purposes.  We Had The Room Outside In The Courtyard/Garden:  No. 52(?),,,,,,
,581,Sorry Cannot Remember But First Floor Turn Right. Very Unpleasant Smell In Hall Way A Sick Smell,,,,,,
,582,I Would Prefer A Kettle In The Room To Having To Order Tea To Be Brought Up.,,,,,,
,583,No Dressing Gown In The Room And Tea And Coffee Would Have Been Nice. No Indication If The Water Was Free Or Charged Same With The Sweets.,,,,,,
,585,Room 29 Mallard. Beautifully Decorated  The Bed Was Huge And Very Comfy  Pillows Were Lovely. Tea Making Facilities Would Have Been Very Welcome  We Felt Guilty That Someone Would Have Had To Struggle Up The Stairs!!,,,,,,
,588,52 - Dog-Friendly  Nicely Done.,,,,,,
,591,Bed And Pillows Were Particularly Hard. Difficult Nights Sleep.,,,,,,
,594,Would Prefer Tea Making Facility,,,,,,
,605,I Think Our Room Was Number 42 But Cannot Be 100% Certain. It Was Distinctly Average Overall  Aside From A Beautiful Chair There Was Nothing Very Nice About It And It Was So Loud All Through The Night And Morning. A Combination Of Street Noise And Neighbours.,,,,,,
,606,Room 51. Would Have Liked A Kettle In The Room.,,,,,,
,607,52 - No Air Conditioning - Very Hot. Disabled Suite Inappropriately Furnished Re Aids In The Bathroom. No Tea Or Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.,,,,,,
,613,Yes  This Is The Only Reason Why We Would Not Return.  The Situation Of The Hotel Is Such That A Great Deal Of On Street Noise Enters The Room  Whether It Be Late Drinkers Leaving The Local Pub  Deliveries Or Rubbish Removal Early In The Morning.  As A Consequence We Had To Sleep With The Windows Shut.  The Room Was Unbearably Hot And Airless And Both My Husband And I  Who Normally Sleep Extremely Well No Matter Where  Had Just About The Worst Nights Sleep In Recent Years.  We Did Mention This In The Morning On Checkout.,,,,,,
,619,I Would Have Preferred Tea/Coffee Making Facilities And An Ironing Board And Iron In The Room,,,,,,
,620,The Room Was Very Warm And Stuffy But Opening All The Windows Helped.,,,,,,
,623,Lack Of Internet In Room,,,,,,
,624,Breakfast Meeting Only So Please Disregard The Answers In Q8,,,,,,
,626,Did Not Get Much Chance To Enjoy The Room And Facilities As We Were Evacuated By The Fire Brigade,,,,,,
,628,Suite 1 - Surprised That There Were No Tea/Coffee Facilities. However  Never A Problem To Get Tea/Coffee From Staff In The Room Or In The Lounge.,,,,,,
,635,The Table Lamp Did Not Work And The Radio/Ipod Player Had A Fault On Its Aux Input But Apart From That Lovely Room.,,,,,,
,636,None,,,,,,
,639,Rather Dark  Needed Morelighting,,,,,,
,645,Our Upgrade Was Not Expected  All Together A Very Plesant Experience.,,,,,,
,648,The Toilet Was In A Very Poor Way And We Informed Reception  It Was Cleaned Straight Away. Room 26.,,,,,,
,651,I Think We Were 28. I Thought The Actual Room A Good Standard But Not Luxurious. The Sleigh Bed Was Great  But Felt The Quality Of Furniture And Tv Etc Let It Down. The Bathroom However Was Excellent With A Great Bath And So Nice (And Less Dangerous) To Have A Separate Shower.,,,,,,
,652,We Were Upgraded To Suite 5 And Was Amazed Loved The Bath!!!,,,,,,
,654,No,,,,,,
,656,33. Bedding Had Stain And Hair In Bed,,,,,,
,658,It Would Have Been More Comfortable If There Had Been More Pillows Available And Perhapd A Choice Of Duvets,,,,,,
,664,We Were Initally Disappointed With Our Allocated Room As I Had Telephoned Prior To Arrival To Ask If We Could Have An Upgraded Room As It Was My Partners Birthday.  When I Pointed This Our We Were Immedialy Allocated Your Best Suite Which Was Absolutely Wonderful,,,,,,
,668,See Above,,,,,,
,669,Toiletries Looked Good A Bit Basic  Delighted We Were Up Graded Thanks,,,,,,
,670,Suite 2   As Previously Stated  Although The Bed And The Room Was Comfortable And The Bathroom Excellent  We Found The Furnishings And Dã©Cor Rather Dark.  Also  Could Hear The Noise Of The Extractor Fan/Aircon Unit Outside The Fire Exit Door All Night (Fortunately I Had Earplugs!)  There Was Also A Very Cold Draught Coming Through The Gap Between The Two Bathroom Window Panes  Though Fortunately The Bathroom Radiator Was Very Hot.,,,,,,
,673,I Stayed In Room 51 (The Room Called Snipe  I Think 51 Was The Number) At First I Was Shocked By How Dark It Was And That It Was Like A Store Front. I Do Not Care For Dark Painted Rooms And Dark Fabrics. The Curtains Were Lovely Though  And The Bed  And In General The Room Was Cozy. The Bathtub Plug Does Not Work. The Windows Do Not Open And That Disappointed Me. However If I Opened My Door And The Door To The Building I Could Get Some Air. It Would Be Good To Let The Window Be Opened To Get A Little Fresh Air! The Street Was So Nice And Quiet And In The End I Really Liked The Location Of My Room And Found It Pretty Cozy. The Bed Was Comfortable And Luxurious. Thank You!,,,,,,
,674,Could Not Unlock Or Use The Safe. Two Lightbulbs Not Working,,,,,,
,679,We Were Given Room 33 Where We Found The Bed To Be So Small We Had 2 Nights With Little Or No Sleep Compounded By The Noise From The Street. The Staff Were Fine And Provided A Fan For The Room As We Had To Close The Window To Minimise The Outside Noise And Thereby Shut Off Any Ventilation. We Didn't Complain As The Booking Was Through Secet Escapes And We Assumed This Was The Standard They Had Arranged For Us. However  For The Third And Final Night Of Our Stay We Checked To See If The Adjacent Room (32) Was Available As We Had Seen Through The Open Door That The Room Appeared Better And Cetainly Had A Decent Sized Bed. The Staff Kindly Arranged For Us To Move To This Room For Our Final Night.,,,,,,
,682,It Was Rather Noisy Outside Our Window Early Seemed To Be Rubbish Collection And Deliveries,,,,,,
,683,The Hotel Is In An Old Building With Sloping Floors. This Cannot Be Changed Of Course. However  In Our One (43)  It Was Almost Impossible To Put Anything On The Two Small Side Tables  Without Fear It Might Fall Off. How About Some Rubber Mats On The Table To Avoid Slipping?,,,,,,
,686,The Bed Was Very Uncomfortable.  We Both Woke With Bad Backs!  The Dog Said Her's Was Very Comfortable.,,,,,,
,698,Lamp Shades Were Wonky No Biggy  But These Details Add To The Whole Look Of The Pkace And We Had To Contact Reception For The Tv Remote As There Wasn't One In The Room.  Also The Radiator In En-Suite Far Too Hot And I Burnt My Backside Twice.  Double Beds Very Disappointing As Majority Of Hotels Now Do Have King Size.  Didnt Sleep Well As Room Very Stuffy Probably Owing To The Hot Radiator Which We Were Unable To Turn Down In En-Suite,,,,,,
,702,Suite 5 - We Were Very Pleased With Our Room And Loved The Design/Decor. The Only Issue Was That The Window In The Bedroom Area Did Not Seem To Close All The Way So We Had A Bit Of A Problem With A Draught Coming In! Other Than That It Was All Excellent.,,,,,,
,703,There Was No Coffee Making Facilities In Our Room And We If We Ordered A Coffee  Â£4 Would Be Charged To Our Account  Which We Felt Was Excessive.  All The Bedding Could Have Been A Lot Better Quality! The Overall Feel Of The Bedroom Was Not Luxurious.,,,,,,
,705,Suite 3..... Delightful  Bathroom Products Could Be More Upmarket... Maybe Miller Harris.... Jo Malone .... Molton Brown Etc Etc,,,,,,
,706,Rooms Differ Greatly. Some Are Bold In Clour Others Rather Gothic/Traditional. I Like The Former But You Could Put Pictures Of All Rooms On The Web So People Can See What Each Has And Ahat To Expect/Select,,,,,,
,708,Room 43 Which Was An Upgrade.I Had Little Sleep Due To A Pump Or Other Device Stop/Starting All Night Long Under The Floor Or In Wall Of The Bedroom. The Bathroom Was Somewhat Oppressive With No Window And With Hindsight I Wish We Has Stayed On The Top Floor Of The Adjoining Building With No Upgrade Where The Room Was Far Nicer  Windows And No Pump Or Device Keeping Me Awake.,,,,,,
,709,Twin Beds Pushed Together For A Suite Is Not Acceptable. Basic And Cheaply Decorated For A Suite.,,,,,,
,710,Room 28. It Was A Nice Room With The Corner Aspect And The Stand Alone Bath Was A Nice Surprise. No Tea/Coffee Making Facilities Was A Disappointment  But We Were Offered Tea/Coffee In The Room.,,,,,,
,711,Suite No1- Disappointed With Lack Of Tea Coffe Making Facilities. I Dont Want To Have To Ring For Room Service In The Morning. A Window Catch/Stay Broken. On Being Shown Room The Uoung Man Flicked A Switch For An Overhead Light In The Sitting Area. No Light Came On Presumably Bulb Gone. Nothing Said - No New Bulb Fitted And I Bet The Light Still Doesnt Work! Sheet Lovely And Good Quality. Good Towels.,,,,,,
,714,Would Have Liked Tea/Coffee Making Facilities,,,,,,
,717,51 Would Have Liked Tea And Coffee Making Facilities.,,,,,,
,720,Please Put Tea Making In Room,,,,,,
,721,No.51 Very Noisy By Other Guests And Staff  Using Stairs. There Should Be A Notice Advising To Use Quietly Not Like A Herd Of Elephants!!,,,,,,
,723,The Bed Was Too Small - It Was Only A Double - As I Am Pregnant I Would Have Wanted A Queen As A Minimum. There Was No Clear Indication From The Website To What A 'Coltsworth' Room Had. I Would Have Paid More To Get A Bigger Bed. There Was Also No Shower Cap In The Bathroom - That Is Probably A Basic Amenity One Can Expect From A Hotel With Quality Like Feathers.,,,,,,
,724,Really Pleased Again With Our Room,,,,,,
,726,Noise Levels From People Walking Around In Room Above Were Quite High,,,,,,
,727,The Water Pump Was Very Loud When Using The Tap To Wash Hands And The Water Would Stop And Start  Not Sure If This Was A Water Saving Device Or Flaw.,,,,,,
,728,Bathrobes Would Have Been Good  Our Room Was Lovely But A Bit Drafty At Night  So If If In Need Of The Bathroom A Robe Would Have Been Ideal.,,,,,,
,729,Suite 1. Shower Cap Would Be Nice,,,,,,
,730,Tea And Coffee Making Facilities Would Have Been Appreciated,,,,,,
,731,Problem With Hot Water But Management Were Proactive In Assisting Us.,,,,,,
,732,Suite 1.  Room Was Very Hot And We Did Ask For A Fan Which Did Take Quite Some Time To Be Delivered. We Do Understand That Hot Weather Is Rather Unusual!!,,,,,,
,742,Room 32. Everything Was Fine.,,,,,,
,743,No Tea-Making Facilities Which I Can Assure You Even In A Boutique Hotel  Should Be Standard. The Staff  However Brought Me A Kettle And Milk Immediately Although My Daghter Had To Go To The Shop And Buy Tea! Suite 1 Was Very Hot-A Fan Would Have Been A Lovely Addition But Ther Wasn't One To Be Found. We Couldn't Find A Hairdrier.,,,,,,
,746,The Room (23) Was Quite Small But Otherwise Everything Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,752,Binmens Lorry Woke Us Vv Early  So Maybe Double Glazing Needed In Room 42?,,,,,,
,753,I Cannot Remember My Room Number  But I Having Seen The Pictures On The Website  And Having Friends Who've Stayed Before  I Was Disappointed With The Room Decor  Although The Bathroom Wasn't Too Bad.,,,,,,
,755,We Stayed In Room 26 On The Night Of 9 March. I Was Not Made Aware At The Time Of Booking That The Room Had Significant Problems. When We Arrived I Couldn't Really Understand Why There Was Such A Large Aircon Unit In The Room. However  After Dinner When Going To Bed I Realised. The Room Is Terrifically Hot And Gets Even Hotter And During The Night The Aircon Is Required To Bring It Down To A Bearable Temperature. However  The Unit Is Very Noisy And Disturbed Our Sleep. When Asked The Following Morning How Our Stay Had Been  We Mentioned That It Had Been A Problem Trying To Sleep With The Aircon On  But Other Than 'Sorry About That' There Was Very Little Sympathy Demonstrated And No Offer Of A Discount Which Was The Least We Expected. Had I Known In Advance I Would Most Definitely Requested To Be Moved To Another Room. You Must Be Aware Of The Problem And To Charge That Room Out At You Standard Rate For Db&B Is Not Good Practice. Trying To Sleep Either In That Heat Or In That Noise Spoilt What Was Otherwise An Enjoyable Stay.  ,,,,,,
,758,Suite 2 -- A More Effective Fan For The Hot Weather!!  But I Am Sure That You Had Difficulty Obtaining Such Items - There Don't Seem To Be Any In The Country!!,,,,,,
,759,The Bedroom Window  A Sash Window   Was Difficult To Open/Close.The Chair Had A Burn Mark  Showing The Padding Underneath. We Pointed It Out To The Staff Member On Arrival. The Mohair Throw Was Beginnig To Look 'Matted'.,,,,,,
,762,Weird One. Your Towels Were Holed A Bit Surprised By That,,,,,,
,763,54. Mirror In Wardrobe Appeared To Be Coming Loose And Access To Room Slightly Hard With How The Room Was Laid Out. Apart From These Minor Factors The Room Was Gorgeous And Every Thing Else Of Fantastic Standard. Loved The Cosy Feel To The Room.,,,,,,
,766,Not Sure Of Room No. The Room Was A Lovely Big Size But Did Lack A Bath Which On A Leisure Visit I Really Enjoy. I Did Call To Check If We Could Change Room But I Understood They Were Fully Booked. There Was Blood Stains On The Wall Handle For The Toilet. We Found Our Sleep To Be Disturbed From Noise On The Floor Above Us  The Bed Also Made Alot Of Noise Whenever Either Of Us Moved Whilst Asleep.,,,,,,
,767,Snipe Room 51: There Were A Few Cobwebs Around The Room,,,,,,
,771,Good Decor Let Down By Rather Cheap Bin And Loo Brush - Suggested Lack Of Attention To Detail.,,,,,,
,777,No Tea Making In The Room,,,,,,
,782,51 I Think  Ground Floor On Street. Quiet Comfortable But Did Not Like Window So Close To Pavement Where People Walked By,,,,,,
,786,Thank You For The Upgrade To A Suite  Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,,
,788,We Were In Suite 5  Which Was Lovely.  The Only Downside Was The Fact That The Walls In The Toilets Has Splash Marks And The Walls Could Have Done With A Wipe; The Lighting Unfortunately Showed The Splash Marks Up A Treat!  The Light Above The Bath Didn't Work But We Didn't Suffer And Reported It The Next Morning.    It Was Otherwise Really Good.,,,,,,
,790,Just As Previously Mentioned- Low Water Pressure Of The Shower And The Creaky Staircase On Other Side Of The Wall To Bedhead ,,,,,,
,791,It Was Very Plush And Comfortable. Huge Bed!,,,,,,
,795,Rm 29. Bed Was Very Lovely And Massive!!,,,,,,
,796,Can't Remember Number But It Was Small,,,,,,
,797,We Both Felt It Was A Small & With Tired Decor.,,,,,,
,798,Top Of Stairs To The Right. Oh Yes The Bloody Towel Warmer Burnt My Arm.,,,,,,
,799,Can't Remember Room - Up The Narrow Staircase Opposite A Suite.  The Iron Bed Looks Nice But Not The Most Comfortable I Have Slept In!,,,,,,
,800,Room Was A Little Small But As We Got A Special Rate That Was Fine And It Was Only For One Night,,,,,,
,801,Suite 1 - Only One Each Of The Toiletries  One Bath And The Shower Gel Was Gone!,,,,,,
,806,We Appreciate That Coffee And Tea Could Be Ordered By Room Service  But We Would Really Have Appreciated Tea And Coffee In Our Room So We Could Make It As And When We Felt Like Doing It  Especially First Thing In The Morning.,,,,,,
,810,Slightly On The Small Side,,,,,,
,814,Please See My Other Comments.,,,,,,
,815,I Have Already Mentioned  I Think Room 54 In The Town House,,,,,,
,817,Few Towels. No Dressing Gown. Hardly Any Wash Products. No Shower Hat. Generally Ver Yvery Poor,,,,,,
,826,Larger Beds Where There Is Enough Room,,,,,,
,829,More Product Needed.,,,,,,
,830,Room 51 - Please See My Earlier Notes On The Issues,,,,,,
,831,A Little Small But Very Comfortable ,,,,,,
,832,Room 54  The Fabric Of The Armchair Has A Very Obvious Rip On The Front.  ,,,,,,
,835,Comments As Before With Regards To Our Room,,,,,,
,836,The Room Was Lovely Although I Think There Could Have Been Some Tea And Coffee Provided And The Tv On The Wall Was Small (Owl) Compared To The Size Of The Room,,,,,,
,838,Happy,,,,,,
,840,No Mirror In Bathroom. ,,,,,,
,841,Suite 5 Just Needs A Bit More Lighting In The Desk Vanity Area As I Was Using It As My Bridal Suite And Struggled To See My Hair Being Done And Lastinute Sewing Etc. ,,,,,,
,842,First Impression Was Ok But Overall  It Was Skimped On Real Quality  I'm Afraid. !,,,,,,
,843,Suite 3 - Perfect!,,,,,,
,844,Room 24 - The Only Negative Was That The Bathroom Radiator Was Very Hot And As It Is A Small Bathroom I Was Worried That I Would Burn Myself When Getting Dressed.,,,,,,
,845,On Our Next Stay We Would Prefer Not To Be In Room 29 As The Climb To The Top Should Be For Younger Clientel.,,,,,,
,846,Would Prefer Tea/Coffee Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,847,Suite 1. Controls On Towel Rail Not Working  Therefore  Towel Rail Was On  Full  Throughout Our Stay.,,,,,,
,848,Suit 4. Pleasantly Decorated  And An Extremely Comfortable Bed.  ,,,,,,
,849,42,,,,,,
,850,No Tea/Coffee  No Hotel Information,,,,,,
,852,Number 54- On The Small Side But Cosy And Comfortable. Pillows Were My Only Issue A Bit Flat.,,,,,,
,854,Suite 2  We Were Grateful For The Upgrade  Though Only Used The Bedroom And Bathroom. The Night Table Lamps Were Faulty  The Knobs On The Antique Cupboard Did Not Match  And Were Not The Originals  So Could Have Matched. Otherwise A Very Pleasant Room,,,,,,
,858,Suite 4 - A Lovely Room. A Little More Art. A Few More Products In The Bathroom And A Better Tv/ Dvd Combo Would Make It Sublime ,,,,,,
,860,Would Of Been Nice To Have Tea And Coffee Making Facilities But Wasn't A Big Thing. Also Some Bubble Bath For Our Big Bath Would Have Just Set It Off  But That's Just Being Fussy. ,,,,,,
,861,Room 43 Woodcock.    The Sloping Floor Although Querky Was A Bit Strange.,,,,,,
,862,28 Goldcrest . The Chairs Were Basic And Out Of Alignment With T V. No Tea Making Facilities Or Frig. The Table Was Unstable ~ A Glass Slipped Off,,,,,,
,863,Our Room Was Tired,,,,,,
,869,We Were In Room 53.  The Bathroom Sink Did Not Drain Properly And Got Backed Up.  I Would Have Preferred An Upper Sheet On The Bed Simply Because Sometimes It Gets Warm And We Would Have Liked A Sheet As Well As The Duvet   ,,,,,,
,871,Plenty Of Space And The Separate Lounge Within The Suite Was Extremely Useful Over The Christmas Break.,,,,,,
,876,The Room (Room 14 I Seem To Remember) Was Great - Comfy Bed  Great Decor  Good Bathroom And Nice Shower (Although That Shower Pump Is Very Noisy!). The Room Was Fairly Clean And Tidy  But There Was Mould In The Window Frames Which Was A Little Off Putting - Obviously Overlooked For A Number Of Weeks!,,,,,,
,881,Fan Was An Issue  Stopped Me Fully Sleeping,,,,,,
,882,We Had To Ask For Toothpaste But This Was Quickly And Efficiently Dealt With For Us So Not A Problem.,,,,,,
,884,Unfortunately There Were No Bathrobes Which I Am Sure You Had Before? And It Took 2 Or 3 Calls To Reception To Answer My Query As To Whether They Were Supplied Or Not! Nobody Seemed To Know Until Housekeeping Arrived At 7.30Pm.,,,,,,
,885,Suite 4 - Could Have Done With Shower And Bath Products In Both The Shower And Bath As We Used Both. Apart From That It Was Lovely!! ,,,,,,
,889, 29. Would Have Liked Shower Gel And Shower Cap. Needed To Be Demonstrated How To Work Hot Water. ,,,,,,
,890,No,,,,,,
,891,Room Number 34 (I Think).  As Mentioned Previously The Wardrobe Would Have Been Fine For Some One Of At Least 6' - 6" But We Found It A Struggle To Hang Things.,,,,,,
,892,Room 53  Our Room Was Very Tastefully Decorated And Comfortable With All The Facilities We Required  We Found It Both Functional And Elegant.,,,,,,
,893,We Loved The Room And The Service Was Excellent  The Fresh Pots Of Tea Were Very Welcome. ,,,,,,
,894,Suite Number 3 We Were Over The Moon To Be Given A Suite. Again Please See Comments. Thank You Again Very Much For The Super Upgrade.,,,,,,
,895,Room 25 - The Room Was Lovely But Due To The Nature Of Old Buildings There Was Quite A Tilt In One Corner Of The Room Which Made Rolling Over In Bed Feel Like You Were Rolling Up Hill.  And You Had To Be Careful How You Placed A Glass For Example On The Bedside Table  As It Could Slide.  It Would Have Been Nice If There Had Been Two Comfortable Chairs In The Room  As Only Having One Meant That One Of Us Had To Lounge On The Bed Instead....... Not So Easy When Trying To Enjoy One Of Your Delicious Teas Or Coffees. But Overall We Enjoyed The Room And These Are Small Points Which If Put Right Would Have Resulted In A Strongly Agreed.  The Bathroom Was Lovely Too.,,,,,,
,896,32 We Noticed A Small Leak In The Bathroom Ceiling,,,,,,
,898,Suite 1. A Minor Issue Was That The Bed Sheet Had Some Dark Marks On It; Unsightly But Not Worth Worrying Anyone About At The Time.,,,,,,
,900,Nice Decor; Tea Delivered Promptly When Ordered. Comfortable Room And Bed. Bathroom Was A Little Odd  And A Few Strange Plumbing Noises.,,,,,,
,901,The Bed Wasn't Very Comfortable - A Bit Lumpy!,,,,,,
,902,Too Hot On Arrival.,,,,,,
,903,Would Like Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,905,Lovely Room (Suite 5) But Lacking In Info About Hotel And Area. Was Expecting Hotel Pack With Info On Telephone/Breakfast/General Woodstock Info/Tv Instructions Etc. Also Perhaps Nice To Put Gin Menu In Rooms Seeing As This Is Your Main Selling Point. There Is So Much To Read It Would The Perfect Thing To Leave In Room For Guests To Peruse.,,,,,,
,906,Mentioned Earlier Re Shower.,,,,,,
,908,Please See Earlier Comments,,,,,,
,912,43: Thought We Would Miss Not Having Hot Drink Making In Our Room But The Service Provided Was More Than Adequate,,,,,,
,915,No.,,,,,,
,925,See Item 8. Re Item 11 Below Only A Bar Snack After Sunday Lunch.,,,,,,
,926,As Previously Mentioned - Just Far Too Warm,,,,,,
,927,Suite 4: Some Noise From Staircase Next To Bed (Beyond Fire Exit Door).  Not Deliberate But Because Stairs Not Carpeted. ,,,,,,
,928,Quail ? 32 I Think.
Would Really Like A Separate Shower,,,,,,
,929,For The Price We Paid - No Issues,,,,,,
,930,Room 52  Nothing To Add As Expected... Prepared To A High Standard.,,,,,,
,932,Room 25.  The Curtain Had Obviously Been Pulled Too Strenuously And Had Come Off Its Rail A Little Which Made It A Little Difficult To Pull Accross.  However The Curtain Rails Simply Met And Didn't Cross-Over Which Let A Little Light To Come In. This Would Explain Why The Curtain Had Been Pulled Too Much.,,,,,,
,933,Suite 3
The Decor Of The Room Was Good And It Was Still Nice And Warm Despite Terrible Weather Outside. The Bathroom Was Great (Good Shower And Big Bath) But Limited Toiletries So I Was Glad I Had Brought My Own.,,,,,,
,935,It Was Chilly  The Towel Rail Didn't Work & The Hot Water Supply Wasn't Great,,,,,,
,936,The Sink Leaked. ,,,,,,
,937,Room 28. Total Luxury. Only Slight Niggle Perhaps Some Bubble Bath Or The Like Would Have Been Welcome,,,,,,
,938,Suite 1  We Were Upgraded And It Was Lovely.,,,,,,
,941,Plenty Of Storage Space But Room Very Small,,,,,,
,943,Room 25.  The Lovely Curtains Diin't Meet In The Middle Well As The Curtain Rail Didin't Overlap But Just Butted Together.  Consequently A Previous Person Who Had Stayed In The Room Had Pulled The Curtain So Strongly That It Had Come Off At The End.,,,,,,
,944,Room 55 - A Very Comfortable  Clean Room. The Last Flight Of Stairs Are Just A Bit Scary But We Did Expect That In An Old Building  So Not A Real Problem.,,,,,,
,945,Suite 3 - A Really Lovely Room  Extremely Spacious  With Comfy Bed And Enormous Bath Tub. We Loved It!,,,,,,
,947,Would Have Preferred A Room With 2 Armchairs Or A Sofa,,,,,,
,949,Room 32 - Can I Have It For All  My Stays Please,,,,,,
,951,Lack Of Wifi Access In The Townhouse Was Frustrating ,,,,,,
,952,The Sink In Our Room (No.42) Took Over 30 Minutes To Empty; The Bulb Had Gone On One Of The Bedside Lights.  We Mentioned These Points To Reception When We Checked Out.,,,,,,
,962,25 The Provision Of A Second Comfortable Chair Would Have Made A Lot Of Difference.,,,,,,
,963,Th Provision Of A Second Comfortable Chair Would Have Made A Lot Of Difference.No.25,,,,,,
,964,The Provision Of A Second Comfortable Chair Would Have Made All The Difference.No25,,,,,,
,965,29  Very Comfortable Bed With Loads Of Pillows  Really Liked The Room.,,,,,,
,966,Not A Major Issue  But The Desk Was Not Level On The Floor And Everything I Put On The Desk Slid Onto The Floor  Also The Cupboard Was Difficult To Open Due To The Nob On The Cupboard Was Broken. 
Both Issues Are Not A Major Problem .,,,,,,

,1,Service Seemed Rather Slow At Times.,,,,,,
,2,Had The 5 Course Tasting Menu - The Beef Course Was One Of The Nicest Courses Of Food We Have Eaten.,,,,,,
,5,We Had The 5 Course Gouret Tasting Menu As Part Of The Travelzoo Package Which Was Disapointing Due To The Size Of The Portions And The Order In Which The Corses Were Delivered  We Did Bring This To The Attention Of The Restaurant Manager And Two Complimenary Cheese Boards And A Glass Of Port Each Were Provided For The Four Of Us.,,,,,,
,6,We Had A Strange Dining Experience. We Ordered The Gin Fusion Menu And The Starter Arrived And Was Fantastic. We Then Waited More Than An Hour For Our Main  With Waiting Staff Giving Mixed Impressions Of Why That Was. One Staff Member Admitted The Main Chef Had Just Walked Out And That Waiting Staff Were Filling In  Which Was Rather Alarming. It Did Explain Our Mains  Which Were Mediocre At Best And Not As Listed On The Menu. When We Asked About This We Got Blank Expressions And No Real Apology. We Were Given An Extra Gin  Without Comment Or Explanation. We Did Ask For The Scallops Which Were Supposed To Accompany The Monkfish And We Did Then Receive These As A Side Between The Main And Dessert. The Desserts Were Fine But Not As Exciting As The Starter.  The Bill Was Not Included Within Our Final Checkout Bill But Wasn't Explained As We Did Query. We Assume It Was Because Of Our Disappointing Experience But It Would Have Been Appreciated If This Was Explained To Us  Rather Than Making Us Ask About Why It Wasn't There Which Wasn't The Most Comfortable Experience.   ,,,,,,
,7,We Felt Aspects Were Overpriced Eg Â£12 For 2 Scallops For A Starter,,,,,,
,10,Tasting Menu Was Okay But Portions Extremely Small.,,,,,,
,14,I Strongly Recommen To Have Music Playin In The Backgrond As The Silent In The Lobby And Restaurant Was Very Awkard: Silent = No Atmospehre - All Tables Dinners Could Hear All Tables Conversation Which End Up As Lack Of Intimassy In Each Table.,,,,,,
,18,The Value For Money Aspect Of The Dinner Was Debatable,,,,,,
,20,Dining Room Was Too Hot Although I Accept The Weather Has Been Unusually Hot.  The Breakfast Was Disappointing As Two Of My Choices Were Not Available.,,,,,,
,21,Really Superb!   I Have Dined In Several Michelin Starred Restaurants And This Was Equally As Good. I Am Surprised You Are Not Two Stars.,,,,,,
,22,Excellent Food  And Should Have A Michelin Star.,,,,,,
,25,We Had A Very Weird Choice Of Music Played To Us On The Night Of Our Dinner.  Unfortunately  Our Table Was Right Next To The Ipod Which Was Playing.  It Would Have Been Nicer And In My Opinion  More In Keeping With The High Standard Of Cuisine To Perhaps Have Chosen Classical.  It Was Strange At First  But We Got Used To It As The Evening Wore On.,,,,,,
,31,We Had Read Adverse Comments About The Tasting Menu And Size Of Portions But Need Not Have Worried As We Were Left Comfortably Full With Taste Buds Suitably Tickled. Breakfast Next Morning Was A Completely Different Matter. We Ordered Juices And Tea/Coffee Expecting It To Arrive Before The Food. It Only Came After 3 Requests And 15 Minutes After Ordering-And Then The Wrong Juice Was Brought. The Porridge Was Seriously Undrcooked Whereas The Full English Was Overcooked And Had Clearly Been Cooked Some Time Before It Was Seved. This Was Such A Pity As We Left On A Low Note Rather Than A High. The Choice Of Cereal And Foods Was Also Disappointing For A Hotel Of Such Class-There Was Little In The Way Of Fresh Fruit  No Croissants Or Bread (Other Than Toast)  No Cheeses Or Cold Cuts  And A Poor Selection Of Cereals Were On Offer.,,,,,,
,34,Small Portions In Tasting Menu. One More Bread Roll And An Extra Course Would Probably Do It!,,,,,,
,36,Our Waitress Was Rude And Impatient And Not Very Friendky,,,,,,
,41,Tasting Menu Was Extremely Sparse.,,,,,,
,42,I Do Think That The Mark-Up On Wine -- And Especially On A Small Glass Of Sherry -- Is Enormous.  For Breakfast I Only Have Tea And Toast  So Can't Really Comment. The Very Cute Little Jam-Pots  However  Were Sticky On The Outside. I Mentioned This To Reception  Who Said They Would Get Something Done.,,,,,,
,45,Really Lovely Food. Only One Veggie Option For Mrs Beaumont.,,,,,,
,50,Dinner Was Fine  Not Excellent.  Portions Very Small For Yorkshire Farmers.  Breakfast Was Not Good.  The Food Was Ok  But The Service Was Dreadful.  Table Too Small For 4 People  Know Where To Put Teapot  Side Plates Etc.  We Put The Teapot On Another Table To Give Us More Room And Then The Waiter Took It Away  Asked For It To Come Back.  The Tea Was Extremely Week In Both Pots.  We Had To Ask For Toast Twice. There Was No Jam Or Marmalade Left On The Buffet Table  I Asked If There Was Any More And The Waiter Just Pointed To The Buffet Table.  They Were Not Busy  But Seemed Very Unorganised And Stressed.,,,,,,
,51,We Were A Party Of Four And None Of Us Liked The Menu  We Swapped To The Al A Carte And Found This No Better  Had We Seen A Menu Before Booking A Table We Would Have Gone Elsewhere To Eat. Portion Sizes Extremely Small.   The Service At Breakfast Was Abysmal. After Being Seated We Were Not Offered Menus  The Table Was Far Too Small For 4 People  No Room For Tea Pot Etc. We Had To Ask Twice For Toast And When It Did Arrive Is Was Like Shrapnel. We Asked Where We Could Find Jam Etc Having Already Looked On The Breakfast Buffet Table (Where There Was None As The Recepticle For It Was Empty) To Be Told On The Buffet And The Waiter Just Kept Walking Before We Even Had Chance To Say That There Was None There. The Choice On The Buffet Breakfast Was Very Poor. The Cooked Breakfast Was Very Nice. It Was The Service That Was The Problem.,,,,,,
,53,No,,,,,,
,54,Had Breakfast At Bang On 7.30 Staff A Little Upset At Our Early Arrival But Warmed Up,,,,,,
,56,Breakfast Organisation Was A Little Hit And Miss. On Both Mornings A Table Had Not Been Set For Us. On The First Occasion When The Table Had Been Set  I Still Had To Ask For Certain Items That Had Been Forgotten. On The Second Morning We Had A Ten Minute Wait In Reception Whilst The Table Was Prepared But There Were No Fruit Yogurts Or Prunes Available. My First Choice Of Salmon And Eggs Was Not Available Due To Having 'Run Out' Of Salmon.,,,,,,
,63,The Food Was Truly Awful  The Main Course Just Assorted Scaps Of Lamb On A Plate With No Vetetables  The Lemon Meringue Square Was Very Synthetic To The Taste.,,,,,,
,64,Very Very Poor Service In Restaurant For Both Dinner And Breakfast Dinner - Cold Food  Only 3 Pieces Of Bread Offered To Us ('Sorry  We've Ran Out') Breakfast - 45Min Wait. Pancakes With Banana And Maple Syrup Turned Up With No Syrup - When Queries  Received Blank Look Then Told 'Sorry  We've Ran Out' I Brought My Girlfriend Here For A Special Anniversary - It Was Truly Embarrassing,,,,,,
,68,The Food Was Superb And The Service Was Excellent We Were Overwealmed By The Whole Experience. Thank You For Helping To Make My Partners Birthday A Very Special Occasion.,,,,,,
,69,The Main Course (Turbot) Came With Scallops Rather Than Langoustine As Per The Menu. When We Mentioned This To The Waiter He Had No Idea That It Was Different And Had To Ask The Kitchen Why This Was (Apparently They Had Run Out Of Langoustine - But Why Hadn't They Told Us That When We Ordered As One Of Us Had Ordered Scallops As A Starter So Might Have Made A Different Choice!).,,,,,,
,72,Ate The Gourmet Menu Was Going Well With A Few Service Mishaps That Were Dealt With Promptly Towards The End Service Tailed Off Dessert Was A Disappointment & No Chocolates Offered With Coffee No Further Drinks Offered,,,,,,
,73,Service In The Gin Bar And Restaurant Was Excellent - All Staff Very Knowledgeable. The Food Really Did Impress - Delicious And Cleverly Thought Of Ingredients. An Overall Lovely Experience.,,,,,,
,76,Breakfast Has Never Been Good.  The 'Buffet' Table Is Very Poorly Stocked And Looks Unappealing.  There Are Things List On The Buffet Table Menu That Aren't There Like Juices. It Takes Ages To Be Served And Even Then You Are Sometimes Given The Wrong Thing  Toast Comes (Cold) Way Before Your Food.  Service Is Nothing Short Of Erratic  Unmanaged And Staff Don't Always Seem To Speak English. Quality Of Food At Dinner Was Very Good  Service Good And Swift.,,,,,,
,79,Rabbits Leg Was Not Available,,,,,,
,80,And The Bar Staff Were Very Knowledgeable About Gin And Wine,,,,,,
,81,Very Poor. Sancerre Served Warm Tasting Menu Very Poor Fried Eggs At Breakfast Burnt.Service Slow Stilted And Distant. You Need A Good Maitre D.,,,,,,
,82,Food - Taster Menu Was Excellent  However Felt The Main Meat And Fish Course Should Have Been Bigger As It Did Not Add Up To A Full Meal. Service - Table Booked For 7.30 And Arrived At Gin Bar For Pre-Dinner Drink At 7Pm And Felt Rushed To Be Taken Through To Restaurant When Had Barely Started Our Drinks. Wine Taster Menu - Glasses Were Not Appropriate To The Different Wines And Were All Left On The Table Even Though Empty  Along With The Glass Already There That Was Unused. The Courses Were Not Substantial Enough To Warrant A Different Wine Per Course. Dining Experience Was Good But Not Exceptional Breakfast - Service Was Good But Food Was Average (Full English And Eggs Benedict),,,,,,
,83,Food - Taster Menu  Excellent Although Main Meat/Fish Course Should Have Bigger And Didn't Add Up To A Full Meal. Service - Table Booked For 7.30  Went To Gin Bar At 7Pm And Felt Rushed To Go To Dinner By 7.20 When Only Just Started Our Drinks. Also  Wine Glasses Served With Taster Wine Menu Weren't Appropriate To The Wine And Were All Left On The Table Along With The Unused Wine Glass Already There. Experience - Was Good Not Exceptional Breakfast - Good Service Althrough The Food Was Average (Full English & Eggs Benedict),,,,,,
,86,Service Was The Weak Point  As There Were Clearly Not Enough Waiters (As We Discussed With Danny) The Food Was Fabulous  But The Overall Experience Was Marred By The Lack Of Attention And The Long Waits.  We Had A Table Booked For 8Pm And Went To The Bar At 7:30 For Drinks.  By 8:20 We Had Still Not Been Called To Our Table And It Had Not Been Made Clear Whether We Had To Go In Ourselves Or Wait  With No Staff In Sight To Ask.  Breakfast Was Average - Obviously Not Cooked By The Chefs Who Had Prepared A Stupendous Dinner The Night Before!  Fruit Salad Ran Out Both Mornings And Was Not Replaced - And In Any Case Consisted Largely Of Apple.  Again  Lack Of Staff Was The Main Problem.,,,,,,
,88,The Meals We Had With You Were Excellent  Though We Found Some Of The Portions A Little On The Small Side But The Menu Itself Was Very Limited Resulting In Us Eating Out On The Third Night.,,,,,,
,89,We Had A Lovely Meal  The Presentation And Quality Was Excellent Although We Felt That Some Of The Portions Were A Little On The Small Side.  My Husband Ate Dinner Twice In The Restaurant And I Accompanied Him On The Second Evening  We Ate Out Elsewhere On The Third Evening As We Felt That The Menu Was A Little Limited And Perhaps Needed To Offer A Few More Options Or Perhaps Specials On Different Evenings?,,,,,,
,96,We Were Put In An Area That Was Like A Cafe Rather Than The Restaurant ( No Tablecloths Etc). The Gin O'clock Experience Was Disappointing,,,,,,
,104,We Enjoyed The Food  But It Was A Shame That The A La Carte Menu Didn't Change At All. Maybe A 2 Or 3 Night Rota?,,,,,,
,106,The Food & Service Was Excellent.  However  Once Again The Funfair Spoiled The Experience Somewhat.  Listening To Restaurant Music Being Drowned Out By The Noise & Screams Coming From The Ghost Train & Looking Out Of The Window Onto A Large Van Containing A Generator Spoiled The Overall Experience,,,,,,
,111,Quality Food. Lovely Breakfast,,,,,,
,112,I Had Cereal For Breakfast So Didn't Manage To Try Any Of The Items On The Menu (Which Did Sound Delicious),,,,,,
,117,Round Table Was A Little Too Big For 2.  Had To Speak Loudly To Be Heard!,,,,,,
,120,We Enjoyed The Experience Of The Taster Menu But Did Go To Bed Feeling Hungry,,,,,,
,122,At Breakfast On The First Day (Good Friday) We Were There About 30 Mins Before The End Of Breakfast And There Were No Staff Around And Most Of The Buffet Had Been Eaten And Not Replenished.   At Dinner On The Second Night We Arrived On Time At 8Pm To A Nearly Empty Restaurant And Were Sat At The Table Between The Only Other Two Tables Occupied At That Time - One Of Which Had A Small Baby And A Small Toddler  So Not Quiet The Romantic Dinner For 2 We Had In Mind.  We Asked To Move To Another Table But Was Told That That Was Not Possible As They Were Very Busy.  However As We Finished Our Meal There Were At Least 4 Or 5 Tables That Were Not Used At All Through Out Dinner Which We Could Have Been Moved To.  It Appears That The Staff While Competent Weren't Able To Think About About What They Were Doing To Respond To Customer Needs. Breakfast On The Second Day Was Slightly Better In Terms Of Staff  But They Had Run Out Of Yoghurt Pots (An Hour Before The End Of Breakfast) And Cleared All The Buffet Before People Had Finished Their Breakfasts.  We Had To Ask If There Were Any Pastries. Having Said All This The Standard Of The Food Was Very Good But For The Prices You Charge Your Service Needs To Be Much More Attentive And Reactive To Achieve The High Standard That Your Prices Indicate.  ,,,,,,
,124,Waiting Staff Pleasant But Service Too Slow And Not Asking If Could Help Further  Tasting Menu Too Pretentious In Portion Size And Too Fussy,,,,,,
,125,We Had The Taster Menu And It Would Really Have Helped If The Menu Could Remain On The Table So We Could Identify The Components Of Each Course. The Food Was Lovely But The Portions Were Tiny So Only Just About Full And My Husband Was Very Pleased To See A Full Breakfast The Next Morning.,,,,,,
,126,Slow Service&Gt;,,,,,,
,127,We Ate In The Restaurant On A Sunday Evening And It Was Relatively Quiet.  It Was A Little Formal Which Is Probably To Be Expected. We Felt That We Were Pushed Together At One End And Everyone There I Think Felt That It Would Have Been Nicer To Have More Privacy And Be Seated Further Apart.,,,,,,
,139,We Were On The Five Course Gourmet Dinner. Whilst My Wife's Lamb Hogget Course Was Fine  Mine Was Completely Inedible. But It Was Replaced Immediately And Without Fuss  However It Should Not Have Left The Kitchen In The First Place!,,,,,,
,143,The 6 Of Us Chose A Variety Of Dishes And All Were Very Good. We Had To Ask For The 2 Portions Of Chips Which Had Been Ordered But Had Been Forgotten. A Second Bottle Of The White Wine That Was Ordered Was Not Available  So Another Kind Had To Be Chosen.,,,,,,
,149,We Felt The Dining Room Lacked Atmosphere And At Times Was So Quiet You Could Hear People Ordering From The Other End Of The Room. The Food Was Excellent Though But Longer Intervals Between The Taster Menu Would Have Allowed Us To Appreciate The Wine More  The Next Course Was Out When We Still Had Half A Glass Left!,,,,,,
,150,The Waiting Staff Came Across Like They Were Trying Too Hard. There Was Absolutely No Atmosphere So We Asked If Some Music Could Be Put On But It Was So Low It Made No Difference At All. Everyone Was Whispering At Their Tables!,,,,,,
,152,I Would Say The Best Food We Have Tasted For A Long Time. Please Please Would You Aka The Chef To Email Me The Recipe For His Cauliflower Soup!!!! I Am Very Ill And Can Only Eat Liquids And The Cauliflower Soup He Made For Me To Have As A Stater Was Out Of This World! I Would Truly Appreciate It Plse. Julieconnoll@Btinternet.Com,,,,,,
,155,Evening Dining - Great Food  Great Wine  Great Service! Breakfast - Great Food  Slightly Let Down By Service. A Bit Clunky And Apologetic Compared To The Slick Evening Operation. Kind And Helpful Staff None The Less.,,,,,,
,161,Dinner: Whilst I Enjoyed My Dinner In The Gin Bar - Which Was Wonderful And Chef Very Kindly Made Me A Dish From The Lunch Menu - It Was Very Apparent That A New Member Of Staff Was Possibly On Her First Night At The Feathers  And Was Very Nervous. This Is Fine  However She May Have Needed A Little More Training And Knowledge On The Menu Before Serving Customers. My Overall Experience Was Good And I Am Sure She Is Now Fully Trained And Aware Of How To Handle All Situations. Breakfast: The Concierge Very Kindly Arranged For Me To Have A Very Early Breakfast For My Early Departure. I Had Ordered Fresh Fruit And Muesli  However I Was Presented With Rice Crispies. This Was A Minor Mistake  And Was Rectified However The Gentleman Who Brought It Up Wasn't Sure What Muesli Was When I Asked For It To Be Swapped. Again  I Was Very Greatful That This Was Arranged For Me  And I Am Sure That If I Had Have Had Breakfast In The Restaurant At The 'Normal' Time Then It Would Have Been Fab!,,,,,,
,162,Unfortunately This Was The Disappointment In Our Stay   This Was A Repeat Visit As The First Stay Was Exceptional .We Only Received 4 Courses Out Of 5 And Also Received The Wrong Main So After Missing Out The Assparagus Course We Carried On Otherwise It Would Of Been A Long Wait   Was Very Disappointing After Last Visit Also We Had Finished Our Wine We Wasn't Offered Any More .,,,,,,
,163,The Quality Of The Food Was Excellent But Whilst I Know It Is Called A Taster Menu I Did Imaging It Would Overall Add Up To The Size Of A Normal 3 Course Meal. This Sadly Was Not The Case And We Were Left Feeling Very Hungry Afterwards.  We Ordered Cheese And Biscuits To Try And Bulk Out The Meal But This Was Also A Small Portion And Did Not Help The Situation.  Overall I Would Like To Score The Food Higher As My Only Concern Was The Size  But It Would Be Hard To Recommend This Experience And I Would Be Concerned About The Size Of The A La Carte Courses Given The Size Of The Cheese Board.,,,,,,
,164,It Was Very Poor!!!,,,,,,
,166,Delicious Food And Excellent Service - A Real Treat,,,,,,
,168,Very Busy Evening And We Had A Table Booking For 8.30.  When We Arrived The Staff Were Very Busy And There Was A Lack Of Acknowledgement Of The Booking.  We Had To Wait For A Table And Due To The Business Of The Area We Were Left For 10 Minutes Before Finding If There Was A Table.  The Usual Overview Of Asking About What We Might Want To Drink Was Overlooked Until After We Ordered.  Not The Best But Partially Understandable Given The Nature Of The Evening.,,,,,,
,170,Too Long To Get A Latte Coffee At Breakfast  Partner And Others At The Table Had Received There Beverages Plus Cereals Before Latte Arrived.  Not Enough Butter For Four People At Breakfast.  Evening Meal: Had To Ask For Sugar  Long Wait Between Coursed On Taster Menu. (Although Waiter Did Appologise For One Course And Deducted Drinks From Our Bill  However After The Wait The Salmon Taster Came Out Cold.  Annoyingly This Should Have Been Hot.,,,,,,
,171,The Service Was Brilliant Both For The Main Dinner And The Breakfast,,,,,,
,174,Breakfast Service Was Very Slow Due To Low Staff / Guest Ratio,,,,,,
,177,You Are Giving Yourselves A Lot To Live Up To With Words Like 'Exceptional'. Dinner Was Good  But Not At An Exceptional Stndard.  Breakfast Was Average.  On Both Mornings The Smoked Salmon Was Not Available.  How Difficult Is It To Go To The Supermarket And Get A Pack Or 2 When You Know You Have Run Out?  Toast Was Hard......Almost Like It Had Been Cooked Twice.,,,,,,
,178,We Were Able To Substitute A Main Course From The Bar Menu,,,,,,
,179,We Were Very Well Looked After And Nothing Was To Much Trouble,,,,,,
,181,Hotel Tap Water Was Great!,,,,,,
,186,We Particularly Enjoyed The Breakfast Which Was Relaxing And We Felt Welcome To Take Our Time.,,,,,,
,187,The Picpoule D'pinet Wine I Felt Was Over-Priced And Not Of The Quality We Are Used To,,,,,,
,190,We Were There On The First Night Of The New Menu So The Staff Were Still Getting Used To The Menu Yet They Handled Any Mistakes Made Very Professionally.,,,,,,
,191,I Thought Dinner To Be Very Good  I Found The Dining Room Menu To Be A Bit Overly Fussy And Would Try The Courtyard The Next Time.,,,,,,
,192,Service At Dinner Was Very Quick  Not The Long And Leisurely Experience We Had Hoped For  The Portion Size Of The Tasting Menu Was Minisule  We Had To Ask For Extra Bread To Fill Us Up. Breakfast Service Was Very Slow  We Needed To Remind The Waiter Several Times For Toast  Coffee Etc. Only One Waiter At Breakfast When The Dining Room Was Full  The Poor Chap Was Delightful And Working Very Hard But There Is Only So Much He Was Able To Do!,,,,,,
,193,Breakfast Was A Bit Disappointing - The Buffet Selection Was Not Very Good And By The Time We Arrived At 9Am All Juice Bottles Were Empty (Although They Were Refilled On Request).  I Ordered Eggs Benedict And Was Told This Was Not Available - I Wished This Had Been Made Clear Upfront.  Dinner On The Other Hand Was Very Nice And The Service Was Excellent.  I Thought We Would Get Coffee And Petit Fours As Part Of The Set Menu But These Never Materialised - Which May Well Have Been My Misunderstanding.,,,,,,
,198,The Menu Wasn't Really To My Taste As I Don't Eat Fish And Some Of The Other Meals Didn't Appeal. For This Reason Our Meal The First Night Wasn't Great. However  Your Chefs Cooked Us A Chicken On The Second Night Which Was Beautifully Cooked And Presented And We Both Really Enjoyed It.,,,,,,
,199,The Vegetarian Selection Was Minimal And Overpriced. Service At Breakfast Was Appalling. The Yoghurts And Pastries Were Not Refilled And There Were None When We Arrived With Half An Hour To Go. There Were No Teacups On Our Table And It Took Ten Minutes To Get The Attention Of A Waiter To Ask For Them And Place Our Food Order. The Tables Around Us Were Not Cleared For Quarter Of An Hour. The Poached Eggs Had Runny Whites One Day And Hard Yolks The Next.,,,,,,
,200,Excellant Breakfast,,,,,,
,202,The Dinner Was Good  But A Little Mannered. Deconstructed Snickers Bar Was Inspired  But Deconstructing An Eton Mess - No  It's Intended To Be Messy: A Wild And Wonderful Mixing Of Textures And Flavours  Surely? You Can Acknowledge A Trend In A Menu Without Throwing Everything At It.,,,,,,
,207,The Tasting Menu Was Expensive And Extremely Small Portions,,,,,,
,208,The Service Did Not Seem As Crisp As Usual,,,,,,
,209,We Had The Tasting Menu.  It Was A Shame That The Waiter Did Not Explain What The Dishes Were When They Arrived. We Also Requested A Cheese Course Which Seemed To Cause Some Confusion,,,,,,
,212,We Felt That The Restaurant Was Perhaps Slightly Understaffed As Had To Wait Quite A While For Service When First Sitting At Our Tables And Often Had To Beckon A Waiter Over.,,,,,,
,213,Disappointing As I Had To Call A Waiter Over To Order Drinks And At The End Of The Meal Had To Request Coffee! Service Definitely Declined Towards End Of Our Meal.,,,,,,
,214,This Made The Stay At The Feathers,,,,,,
,215,Amazing Food And Wine,,,,,,
,216,Staff Were Very Accommodating In Finding Alternative Veggie Options In The Tasting Menu.,,,,,,
,233,Superb! Want To Come Again..,,,,,,
,234,Please See Previous Comments.,,,,,,
,235,Service During Our Evening In The Restaurant Was Slow And We Left Feeling That We Should Have Had Better Attention.  Our Breakfast On Our First Morning Was Slow But Very Good And As We Had Decided To Stay An Extra Night Our Breakfast The Following Morning Was Excellent.  Some Of The Staff Could Have Been A Bit Friendlier.,,,,,,
,236,Evening Meal - Dessert Was Tasteless.  Breakfast - Bacon And Sausage Were Over Cooked.  There Was No Marmalade Made Available Only Jams And Honey.,,,,,,
,237,The Feathers Would Benefit From A Toaster That Works On Both Sides Of The Bread.Staffing On Monday Had Difficulty Serving The Number Of Guests And Meeting Requests.,,,,,,
,239,We Had The Tasting Menu As Part Of A Travelzoo Deal And Whilst The Quality Of Food Was Very Good The Portion Size Was Far Too Small  Especially Given The Price Of Â£55Pp; We Went Out After Diinner To The Chip Shop Down The Road To Share A Large Portion Of Chips!!  The Eggs Benedict Was Extremely Good But The Full English Was Disappointing. The Poached Egg Was Cooked Very Well But The Sausage And Bacon Looked Like They Had Been Hanging Around For A While  Being Very Dry.,,,,,,
,241,Amazing Food!!!!!,,,,,,
,246,At Breakfast I Ordered Just Tomatoes And Mushrooms And Got One Of Each - It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had Slightly More (I Did Ask If I Could Have 2 Mushrooms)! There Were Also No Bowls Left When We Arrived For Breakfast But That's Not The End Of The World! Dinner Was Lovely!,,,,,,
,247,The Staff Were All Absolutely Lovely ... Only The Maã®Tre D' Was 'Efficient' To The Point Of Rushing Our Menu Choices As He Was So Busy!  The Food Was Delicious And All Beautifully Presented With The Exception Of The Bowl Of Ice Cream (As It Was A Busy Evening And Some Dessert Choices Had Run Out) The Ice Cream Flavours Were Not Advised And The Presentation Poor In Comparison To The Other Desserts.,,,,,,
,248,Unfortunately There Was A Delay With Our Breakfast Due To The Eggs Being Mis-Ordered. That Meant That The Rest Of The Dish Had Been Kept Warm And The Bacon Was Very Tough. I Am Sure However That This Would Not Normally Be The Case.,,,,,,
,253,Our First Evening Was Rather Unfortunate In The Time It Took To Be Given A Menu  Take The Food And Wine Order And Start To Eat. We Also Had To Ask For The Wine Having Already Been Given Our Starters. This Was After We Had The Tasters And The 'Soup'.  The Sunday Breakfast Left A Lot To Be Desired. I Was Unable To Cut Into The Bacon [ Was Given New] The Scrabbled Egg Was Left Uneaten.  The Second Evening We Asked To Eat Earlier [By Half An Hour] To Be Told On Arrival That We Were Early But They Could Accommodate Us. We Ordered The Beef That My Daughter Had The Evening Before But It Was No Way Cooked As It Had Been Previously. I Gave Mine To My Husband.  The Monday Breakfast For My Daughter Was A Joke. She Ordered The Pancakes Only To Be Told They Were Unavailable. She Ordered The French Toast With Maple Syrup And Told Again There Was No Syrup. We Thought That It Was Unusual To Have These On The Menu Yet The Kitchen Could Not Supply Either Of Them.,,,,,,
,257,Service Was Very Slow And Generally The Establishment Seemed Understaffed.,,,,,,
,259,Our Waiter Was Lovely (I Didnt Get His Name But He Was Very Charming With A Slight Speech Impediment) And Very Friendly,,,,,,
,260,There Seemed To Be A Problem On The 2Nd Morning.  Breakfast Was Not Of The Same Quality  Service Was Slow And Some Staff Appeared To Be Trainees Who Were Unsure Where Food Should Be Going.,,,,,,
,263,Excellent Wine List.,,,,,,
,265,We Had The Gourmet Menu Which Was Fantastic.  Also The Barman In The Courtyard For Pre Dinner Drinks Was Extremely Helpful And Knowledgable.,,,,,,
,266,While The Older Gentleman Who Served Us Was Very Good  The Younger Servers Were A Bit Unattentive And Also Managed To Mix Up At Least One Of Our Orders On Every Meal (Breakfast And Lunch),,,,,,
,267,The Food At Lunch Was Disappointing As The Tuna Lacked Flavour And Was A Very Small Portion For The Price. Also While The Older Server We Had Was Very Good  The Younger Staff Did Not Know The Food On The Menu And Often Got Our Order Wrong (Lunch And Breakfast).,,,,,,
,268,We Had A Lovely Lunch In The Bar. Beautifully Cooked And Presented. Our Evening Meal In The Dining Room Was Good Too But We Found The Free Chocolate Taster A Little Rich Just Before Our Orders Dessert. A Lovely Thought Though.,,,,,,
,270,We Dined In The Bar  Which Was Ok.  One Evening Our Experience Was Spoiled By A Group Of Five Very Noisy Rugby Player Types  Who Seemed To Have The Priority Attention To The Detriment Of Our Service - We Waited A Long Time To Be Served After The Starter.  Worse Was That The Group Obviously Thought They Were In A Public Bar And Their Loud Conversation Included Swearing (F-Word).  This Was Appalling And My Wife Went Over And Asked Them To Refrain As They Were Spoiling Our Evening To Which They Responded 'God Bless You'.  We Do Not Understand Why Such Types Should Be Allowed To Eat In (Presumably They Were Non Resident),,,,,,
,271,Service A Little Slow Sometimes  Our Starters Were Missed So Late To Arrive But Apology Made. We Ordered A Second Bottle Of Wine Which Was Late To Arrive - Apologies Were Made And No Charge For 2Nd Bottle Which Was Appreciated. Food Was Quite Good But Again Disappointing Compared To Similar Hotels,,,,,,
,276,We Dined In The Restaurant For Dinner And Breakfast. Breakfast Selection Was Excellent And Service Attentive And Friendly. However We Were Quite Disappointed With Dinner. Service Was Extremely Slow  Almost An Hour To Wait Before Starters Were Served. Another Long Wait Before Main Course Arrived And Then The Dessert Chosen Was Not Available. Not Previously Advised Of This. Portions Were Not Generous Considering The Prices Charged. The Lamb Main Course Was Very Well Cooked And Exceptionally Tasty. We Had Ordered Side Dishes With Our Main Courses Which Didn't Arrive Until A Good 5-10 Minutes After The Main Course Was Served And There Was No Mention Of The Delay Until We Queried This With The Waiting Staff. Overall Rather Disappointed Considering The Amount Paid For The Meal. Not A Great Dining Experience Unfortunately.,,,,,,
,278,Having Dined At Gordon Ramsey In London And Marco Pierre White Again In London We Both Said That Was The Nicest Meal We Have Ever Had. The Beef Was Exceptional. Thank You,,,,,,
,281,Breakfast  A Lot Of The Food Layed Out Had Gone By 9Am And Empty Plates Left  Ie No Fruit And No Water,,,,,,
,286,Please See Previous Comments Re Staff/Ambience And Re The Food - It Was Good But Not Exceptional Hence My Husband And I Didn't Have A Dessert. The Breakfast Was On The Small Side - One Small Mushroom?,,,,,,
,288,Dinner Menu Was Not Very Inspiring. Burger Was Good. Breakfast Was Ok.,,,,,,
,289,Service At Breakfast Was Very Slow And We Had To Wait To Place Our Orders And There Was A Long Wait Before The Toast Was Served.  No Top-Ups Of Tea/Coffee Were Offered And The Croissants Were Finished Before We Got To The Self-Service Table.  However The Staff Were Friendly And Obliging - Possibly You Were Short Staffed?,,,,,,
,290,The Quality Of The Restaurant Menu Was Extraordinary,,,,,,
,291,Breakfast Service A Little Slow; Inattentive.,,,,,,
,302,Really Lovely Food - Enjoyed It All,,,,,,
,304,We Booked Your Sleep And Dine Offer Which Included A 5 Course Gourmet Tasting Menu  We Were Very Disappointed With The Portion Size  We Have Been To A Few Tasting Nights Before And The Portions Where Very Small By Comparison...Very Disappointed After A Long Journey Down From Manchester.,,,,,,
,305,These Are Comments Not Meant As Criticism. We Had The Taster Menu. My Cod And Scallop Were Over Cooked. My Wife's Was Not. Our Lemon Meringues Could Have Been Put Together By Two Different People In Two Different Rooms. They Looked Substantially Different. I Was Always Taught That With This Standard Of Food  Each Plate Should Look The Same.,,,,,,
,310,Dinner Was Excellent. No Complaints About The Food At Breakfast But The Service Was Terrible. Several Tables Who Arrived After Us Were Served First And Wasn't Easy To Find Help!,,,,,,
,311,Waiters Were Very Attentative.,,,,,,
,314,The Food Was Sublime  Utterly Magnificent  And Probably The Best I've Ever Eaten. The Experience Was Slightly Let Down By A Couple Of Minor Issues With The Service  But Overall  It Was Very Enjoyable.,,,,,,
,316,Tremendous Attention To Detail And The Staff Were Charming And Skilled In Their Service.,,,,,,
,317,The Gin Experience Was Fun. Some Dishes We Wouldnt Normally Choose And The Gins Which Made It Even More Interesting.  Friendly And Informative Waiter. Unfortunately One Of The Other Diners Had Two Too Many Gins And Was Very Loud!,,,,,,
,318,Scrambled Egg Was The Best I Have Ever Had And I Told The Waiter So  -- Recipe Please  !!!!,,,,,,
,319,Many Recommendations To The Chef And Waiter Whom Were Able To Serve Us Lunch Instead Of Dinner On Friday The 14Th Of June 2013. It Was One Of The Highlights Of Our Wedding Day And A Wonderful Experience To Be Able To Spend Some Private Time For The Degustation Of Five Truly Beautiful Courses And An Exceptional Service By The Waiters.  Thank You So Much To All For Accommodating Our Requests.   On That Note  We Would Also Like To Say A Big Thank You To All Whom Prepared Our Desert Course For Our Arrival Late On Friday Night. Delightful!   The Breakfast Was Also Very Good. We Had Our Pancake Starters In The Bedroom Followed By The Second Course At The Restaurant Which Were Both Really Tasty. There Is Just One Minor Comment About The Room Service As Our Coffee And Tea Were Served With No Sugar Bowl Nor Milk Something Which Surprised Us For An Overall Exceptional Service.    Many Thanks Again. Mrs Harvey,,,,,,
,320,The Food Was Fine But In No Way Exceptional.  Was Pleased That The Dish Which Was Definitely Not Fine Was Credited To Our Account Without Any Need For Us To Ask.  Might Have Been Nice To Have Been Offered An Alternative Instead Of Having To Fill Up On Cheese.,,,,,,
,322,Dinner Was Exceptional.  Breakfast Was Good But There Was No Haddock And The Fresh Lemon Did Not Seem To Go With The Kippers.  Just A Small Thing As Would Definatley Recommend Your Lovely Hotel.,,,,,,
,326,Ordered Pre Dinner Drinks Half Hour Before Our Dinner Reservation. But These Did Not Arrive Until After We Were Seated For Dinner. When We Reminded Staff We Were Still Waiting We Were Only Told They Were On Their Way.,,,,,,
,328,We Were Delighted When We Asked If We Could Change Our Restaurant Reservation To Enable Us To Eat In Our Room (Suite 4) - After A Long And Tiring Day This Was Perfect For Us.,,,,,,
,329,Service Very Good And Friendly But Two Course Beetroot Salad And Beef Were Disappointing And Very Small. Have Eaten At Fine Dining Restaurants Before But Thought It Was Too Small Portions And Lacked Taste. Also Disappointed Booked This On Pretext Of Â£55 Five Course Meal On Arrival This Was Advertised As Â£45 But Because I Had Booked Through Tripadvisor This Was Not Refunded.,,,,,,
,331,Our Experience On The Second Morning Was Poor As We Waited For 25 Mins For Someone To Take Our Order For A Cooked Breakfast  Having Already Received Our Hot Drinks But Not Toast  But We Seemed To Be Ignored Although The Half A Dozen Other Tables That Arrived Downstairs After Us Were Served. As A Result We Walked Out Of The Restaurant And Told Reception Who Did Then Deduct Money From Our Bill.,,,,,,
,333,The Level Of Attentiveness Of The Staff And Their Attention To Detail Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,334,Dinner Was Good ( Exceptional Is A Very High Standard) But Not A Michellin Star Standard Which In My Experience One Can Usually Rate As Exceptional. Likewise Breakfast Was Very Good With A Good Selection But It Lacked Something Which I Am Afraid I Can't Put My Finger On To Make It Memorable.,,,,,,
,335,Evening Waiter Needed More Authority To 'Adapt' The Menu Options For Us As We Had A Guest With A Food Allergy.,,,,,,
,340,The Dining Room Could Do With A Slight Life As The Ambiance Needed Some Work.  The Food Itself Was Exceptional And The Attention To Detail Was Superb.  The Chef Took The Challenge Of Lactose Intolerance Seriously,,,,,,
,341,Dinner Was Very Good   Really Delicious.  The Restaurant Manager Was Polite But The Other Staff Were A Little Lack Lustre.  Breakfast I Think Was Good  But There Were No Baked Goods On The Buffet And The Wait Was Long.  Service Seemed A Little Disjointed.,,,,,,
,347,The Staff Were Superb: Very Attentive And Polite.,,,,,,
,348,The Rib Eye Was Tough And The Polenta Over Cooked Which Let Down An Otherwise Good Experience,,,,,,
,349,Sausages Were Burnt  Toast Under Done  Orange Juice Served After Main Breakfast.,,,,,,
,352,Disappointed That Only The Restaurant Was Open On A Saturday Night.  We Booked For 8.30  I Understand This Is The Latest Sitting As We Were Pushed For Time And Not Able To Put It Back To 8.45.  Did Thane Time To Finish Our Gins Before We Were Moved To Restaurant.  We Both Had Scallops To Start. We Each Received One And A Half Queen Scallops Each  Obviously Running Low  But That Was An Absolute Insult For The Price And To Cut One In Half For Us To Share  Appalling.  The Main Course Was Similar.  I Ordered The Lemon Sole.  I Am Sure On The Menu It Said Potato  Maybe Fondant Potato  Anyway  No Sign Of Potato  Infact Two Mouthfuls And That Was The Meal Eaten!  The Chees Though Was Very Nice And A Good Selection.,,,,,,
,353,Sadly The Courtyard Was Not Open On Saturday Nights We Had To Use The Restaurant.  We Were Hurried Through To Our Tble Booked At 8.30.  We Ordered Scallops To Start.  I Guess It Was A Popular Choice That Evening As One And A Half Scallops Was All We Got  Queen Scallops At That.  Totally Overpriced And Ridiculously Small Portion.  I Had Lemon Sole For Main.  Nothing To It.  It Was Supposed To Come With Potato According To The Menu But There Was No Potato On The Plate  In Fact There Was Very Little On The Plate.  When I Asked About The Potato  I Was Told That It Didn't Come With Potato.  We Left It At That And Decided We Would Stay With You Again But Will Never Eat In The Restaurant Again.,,,,,,
,357,We Booked A Table For The Thursday Evening (7.30Pm) But Unfortunately When We Went To Take Our Booking  There Was No Record Of It.  Fortunately You Accommodated Us With A Table At The Above Time  But It Made Us Feel Quite Embarrassed  And Unfortunately We Did Not Get Our Main Meal Until 9.00Pm.,,,,,,
,361,Portions Of Tasting Menu Very Small,,,,,,
,364,The Service Was Very Good In The Dinning Room But Rather Spotty I The Bar The Next Day At Lunch. Your Maitre Is Superb As Was The Receptionist. They Both Bent Over Backwards To Accommodate Our Every Wish,,,,,,
,366,The Meal Was Very Nice. The Cooked Breakfast Did Not Seem To Come With Toast  Which Seemed Strange? No Blood Sausage Included  But Mentioned On The Menu. The Coffee Was Too Weak.,,,,,,
,369,We Had The Five Course Tasting Menu.  Some Of The Courses Were Rather Small.  Also  Breakfast Service Was Slow Considering The Number Of Guests Being Served.,,,,,,
,372,The Gourmet Tasting Dinner Was Let Down By Wines Which Were  To Be Honest  Rather Indifferent - Particularly The Nz Sauvignon  Which Was Really Disappointing.  The Staff Appeared Unsure How To React When We Made Them Aware Of This.  A Shame  Because The Meal (Ie The Standard Of Cooking) Was Excellent.  So Far As Breakfast Was Concerned  We Were Very Well Looked After  But Did Have To Wait Quite A Long Time For Our Food To Arrive On The Sunday (One Couple Arrived After Us But Left Before Us  Having Had Their Two Courses Before Our Meal Arrived).,,,,,,
,376,Rather Noisy 'Corporate' Table Nearby At Dinner. At Breakfast Toast Arrival Was Very Late. Otherwise All Very Memeorable.,,,,,,
,377,Would Have Preferred Not To Have The Tasting Menu As Individual Courses Were Delicious And Not Enough On The Plate.,,,,,,
,380,The Food Was Ok  Not Excellent. We Had Tasting Menu And There Was Repeated Flavours. The Soup Had A Skin On It And Was Like Warm. Service Was Not Slick And Professional Nor Was Or Relaxed And Friendly. We Were Kept Waiting For A Long Time To Order Hot Breakfast After Being Told Ill Be With You In A Minute.,,,,,,
,382,Tasting Menu We Thought Was Slightly Disappointing   The Flavour A Were Not As Good As We Had Hoped But Still Enjoyed It.,,,,,,
,386,We Were Going To Have Dinner Bt Opted Instead To Just Have Appetizers. The Quality Of The Two Appetizers Was Very Good  But The Prices Were Too High And The Selection Too Limited For Us To Stay For An Entire Dinner. We Have Our 17 And 14 Year Old Teenagers With Us And It Was Way Too Fancy And Expensive. Breakfast Was Great However.,,,,,,
,388,My Chair  At The Far End Of The Dining Room Facing The Street  Put My Head In Direct Line With The Security Light On The Building Opposite Which Was A Little Blinding And Off-Putting. Perhas Some Blinds On The Top Of The Window Would Prevent This. Also  Some Quiet Background Music Wouldn't Be A Bad Thing - We Thought There Was A Lack Of Atmosphere When We First Arrived (Until Everyone Had Had A Few Glass Of The Exceptional Wine!),,,,,,
,389,As Previously Stated,,,,,,
,391,Stunning And The Food Was Fantastic!!,,,,,,
,392,My Partner Felt The Water And Wine Should Have Been Poured For Us At The Table.,,,,,,
,394,All Staff Very Good Daniel And Corina Delightful ( See Trip Advisor Comments),,,,,,
,396,The Service Was Poor  The Staff Did Not Listen Properly And Were Rushing Rather Than Being Attentive,,,,,,
,403,We Were Staying On A Dinner  Bed And Breakfast Rate. We Weren't Told On Booking That The Dinner Was The Tasting Menu. When I Questioned This On The Evening I Had A Very Poor Response. We Were Eventually Allowed To Have The A La Carte Menu. The Food Was Very Good In The End  Service Was Average. Breakfast Was Good But Service Was Very Poor. Unprofessional And Loud Waiter And Another Young Waiter Who Got My Husbands Order Wrong Twice. We Gave Up Correcting Him In The End.,,,,,,
,405,No,,,,,,
,406,The Portion Of The Beef Course Was Very Small For Â£50.  However  When We Pointed This Out We Were Given An Extra Steak And Not Made To Feel Bad About It  This Was Excellent Service. The Food Was Very Good As Well.,,,,,,
,414,Staff Were Not Very Attentive  All Seemed A Bit Bored. The Barman Was Excellent  And Was Much More The Quality We Expected Of The Staff. No One Was Rude  But Just Lacked Any Hint Of Enthusiasm. The Courses Were All Very Pleasant  But By No Means 'Excellent'. The Sweetbreads With The Pork Were Genuinely Revolving  Squidgy In The Middle  And I Feel  Ruined The Rest Of The Meal For Us.  The Restaurant Itself Is Very Pleasant,,,,,,
,415,The Star Of The Dinner Was The Gentleman Who Enthusiastically Explained Each Dish And Matching Wine. We Were Hugely Entertained By His Passion And Knowledge. Other Staff Appeared To Be Inexperienced Although They Were All Friendly. Breakfast Was Less Than Mediocre And Should Be Improved.,,,,,,
,417,The Restaurant Was Under Staff Both At Dinner And Breakfast But As We Weren't In A Rush It Was Not Particularly A Problem.     More So For The Staff Than Us I Think.    They Were Very Stretched Particularly At Breakfast.,,,,,,
,418,Breakfast Was Very Good Although I Was Surprised To Find  For An Establishment That Prides Itself On Its Food  That Hash Browns Were A Rather Basic 'Pre-Packaged Triangular' Offering.  That's What I'd Expect In A Premier Inn.  You Need To Cook Them From Scratch..,,,,,,
,420,The Food & Waiting Staff Were Both Excellent. Our Entire Party All Commented On How Good The Food Was. Both In The Evening And At Breakfast.,,,,,,
,424,The Taster Menu Was A Big Let Down. We Had To Go Out And Eat At Another Restaurant Straight After. In Hinsight The Meal Was A Waste Of Time. I Do Not Eat Much Genrally And Even For Me It Was Not Enough Food :(,,,,,,
,428,Service At Breakfast Was Dreadful.  Supper Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,429,Ive Mentioned This Before.  Food Was Very Good  Service Appalling Really.,,,,,,
,430,Dining Was Excellent  - Wide Range Of Options With Tasting Menu,,,,,,
,434,Some Of The Courses On The Gourmet Menu Were Minute And Not All That Tasty. The Lamb Was Cold & Fatty With Warm Gravy. Not What We Would Call Gourmet. We Have Eaten Much Better Food.,,,,,,
,435,I Realise There Was A Large Party Staying Overnight Who Completely Took Over The Bar Area Before Dinner  But In This Situation  It Should Have Been Suggested To Us That We Sit In Another Part Of The Hotel For Our Pre-Dinner Drinks.  We Would Have Liked To Partake Of The Gin Experience But Were Told This Had To Booked In Advance - This Was Not Stated In 'The Feathers' Newspaper And We Could Have Come Down To The Bar Earlier In The Evening If Known.  The Set Dinner Was Acceptable But We Felt Rather Rushed Between Courses Because It Appeared The Staff Wanted All The Diners (Apart From The Large Party) Eating Each Course At The Same Time.  Breakfast Was Acceptable But We Had To Request Toast - Shouldn't This Be A Standard Item?  Although We Were Served Reasonably Quickly  Others Around Us Had To Wait To Be Given Menu's  There Weren't Enough Tables Layed Up And It Seemed Quite Chaotic.  Although All The Staff Were Friendly  They Were Not All Professional And It Would Appear That More Staff Training Is Needed And Hence  We Did Not Pay A Service Charge And Will Not Be Coming Back To Visit You.  ,,,,,,
,438,We Had Room Service Twice And Each Time Something Was Forgotten Ie Cutlery  Butter   Kettchup,,,,,,
,441,The Staff Coped Very Well On Two Very Busy Evenings....,,,,,,
,442,None At All  Excellent!,,,,,,
,443,Mentioned Them Previously. If You Are Going To Sell The Hotel On The Gin Bar Experience  Please Have It Manned More Often And By Someone Who Knows The Products. Customers Were Left Waiting To Be Served. Just Seemed To Be A General Air Of 'I Dont Care' About The Staff Which You Cant Teach Unfortunately.,,,,,,
,444,The Dining Experience Was Good But Not Exceptional,,,,,,
,447,We Had A Lovely Stay. Our Waiter  A Young French Lad Was Very Good And Attentive. The Only Thing Lacking Was People And Atmosphere Really- The Restaurant Was Extremely Quiet. I'm Sure This Will Change With Continued Offers And Spreading Of Word Of Mouth.  The Bar Man Was Also Extremely Helpful With His Knowledge Of Drinks Menu.,,,,,,
,450,Over Eleven Pounds For A Gin And Tonic Was Really  Really Pushing It.,,,,,,
,451,Expected Coffee To Be Included In The Price Of Our Meal.,,,,,,
,452,It Was Very Hard To Get The Waiters Attention And It Was Funny To Begin With But Irritating By Our Second Meal. Service Was Fine At Breakfast.,,,,,,
,455,A Full English Breakfast Consited Of One Sauasage One Egg One Piece Of Bacon One Mushroom And Half A Tomato Not A Full English Breakfast,,,,,,
,457,Felt Dining Room Rather Old Fashioned,,,,,,
,458,Excellent Service However Some More Explantion Of The Dish Put In Front Of Us Would Be Better,,,,,,
,459,We Actually Found The Atmosphere Between The Staff At Dinner Very Strained And Heard The Head Waiter Telling Off One Of The Other Staff. There Was A Long Wait Before Our Wine And Food Order Was Taken. The Head Waiter Saw My Husband Go To Fill My Wine Glass After It Had Been Sat Empty For A While And He Actually Snatched The Bottle Off My Husband To Pour It For Me  We Weren't Very Impressed. It Wasn't Very Friendly At All In The Restaurant And It Wasn't A Very Enjoyable Experience. The Staff Should Smile More And At Least Try And Make People Feel Welcome. Breakfast Was Totally Different And The Girls In There Were Really Smiley And Efficient,,,,,,
,460,The Tasting Menu Was Too Flimsy - I Would Not Have It Again.,,,,,,
,461,We Actually Found The Atmosphere Between The Staff At Dinner Very Strained And Heard The Head Waiter Telling Off One Og=F The Other Staff. There Was A Long Wait Before Our Wine And Food Order Was Taken. The Head Waiter Saw My Husband Go To Fill My Wine Glass After It Had Been Sat Empty For A While And He Actually Snatched The Bottle Off My Husband To Pour It For Me  We Weren't Very Impressed. It Wasn't Very Friendly At All In The Restaurant And It Wasn't A Very Enjoyable Experience. Breakfast Was Totally Different And The Girls In There Were Really Smiley And Efficient.,,,,,,
,464,As My Previous Comment Plus: I Was Sent The Wrong Menu And Asked To Pre-Order. The Food Was Excellent Unfortunately The Service Was Too Slow. Many Of My Group Had Travelled Some Distance And This Was A Problem.,,,,,,
,465,On The Night We Stayed There Was A Large Party Booked From 8Pm.  This Had A Major Impact On The Level Of Service Regarding Our Meal  As Well As Others Who Were Dining At The Same Time As Ourselves.  One Of Our Main Courses Was Cold And Served Without The Side Dish.  The Side Dish Then Arrived.  The Dish Was Replaced After Some Time Without A Fresh Side Dish.  It Was Noted That Other People Dining At The Same Time Had Similar Problems  Even The Party Of 16!!!.  On Our Previous Stay The Dining Experience Had Been Very Good However.,,,,,,
,466,A Change Of Menu On The Second Night Would Have Been Welcome.,,,,,,
,467,Everything Was Great In The Restaurant However I Do Think Dead Daffs In The Bar Gives The Wrong Message  It Is Best To Have No Flowers And Just Candles Than Dead Ones.,,,,,,
,473,Service For Dinner Was Disgraceful. $ Americans Were At Next Table And I Was Uncomfortable With The Immage They Will Take Hoe Regarding Brittish Service.,,,,,,
,475,The Bar Was Slow With Pre-Dimmer Drinks  We Were In A Party Of 4 And Were Sat At A Large Circular Table Which Two Of Us Couldn't Seat Properly  We Requested To Be Moved  The Waiting Service Was Poor And Seemed Inept  One Of The Couses Was Forgotten And There Was A Seat Placed In Front Of A Fire Door Opening Into The Dining Room. Overall The Experience Was Not Of The Standard We Have Received Previously.,,,,,,
,477,Very Mixed Reaction To Food.  Lamb Asseite Was Full Of Fat And Largely Inedible.  Service Was Poor - Apart From Sven Who Really Was Very Welcoming - Nothing Was Too Much Trouble Unlike The Other Serving Staff.  Wrong Champagne Opened At Table - Finally Got A Replacement But By That Time We Were Half Way Through Our Starters.,,,,,,
,478,No,,,,,,
,481,Full English Breakfast Was Defiantly The Low Point  Overcooked And Dry  With Slow Service.,,,,,,
,485,A Lot Of Waiters Hanging Around Not Doing Much - Ie Not Re-Filling Wine Glasses And Had To Be Reminded Of That And Other Things.. This Was In The Evening. The Breakfast Staff Were Excellent,,,,,,
,486,Breakfast Very Disappointing. All The Guests Had Arrived At The Same Time And The Number Of Staff On Duty Were Struggling To Cope. It Took 25 Minutes For Us To Get Served With Tea And The Buffet Table Was Very Understocked So We Couldn't Serve Ourselves With Anything. Priorities On A Sunday Must Be To Get Tea/Coffee Served And Keep The Buffet Stocked Up. After That  We Wouldn't Have Minded Waiting For The Cooked Breakfast.,,,,,,
,488,The Food Was Good. The Waiter Was Pleasant -- But Service Really Was Very Slow And There Was A Mistake In Our Main Course Order Which Had To Be Rectified. This Caused Further Delays And Rather Spoiled The Overall Dinner  Though The Head Waiter Did His Best To Make Up For The Waiter's Error.,,,,,,
,489,Some Small Problem Locating Wine  And Chosen Wine Being Out Of Stock But Still On List  Service A Little Erratic At Dinner!,,,,,,
,493,Quantities Reflect Current Trend  Which Is Towards An Art Form Rather Than Quantity. The Meals Scored Extremely Highly On Presentation  But Beware Reducing Quantity Any Further,,,,,,
,496,Our Dining Experience Was A Disappointment So Say The Least.  First Course 'Ham Hock Terrine' Was Exactly As It Said On The Tin I.E. Over Salty Ham Hock That Had Been Placed In A Terrine Dish.  No Bread Had Been Offered To Us - Had To Ask. After A Very Long Wait Our Second Course Arrived.  My Husband Enjoy His Chicken Infuse With Gin.  Memories Of My Assiette Of Pork Make Me Feel Queasy Even Now.  Some Pieces Were Undercooked And Cold And Other Just Very Unpleasant.  We Spoke With Our Server Who Tried His Best In The Situation And Offered Another Dish  Which I Refused.  Had No Desserts.  The Offending 'Pork' Was Deducted From The Bill.  Cancelled Our Table For Sunday Lunch. ,,,,,,
,498,The Dining Room Was A Little Chilly,,,,,,
,501,We Were Disappointed With The 5-Course Dining Experience As We Felt The Portions Were Extremely Small And The Gentlemen In Our Party Wanted To Go To The Pub Afterwards For Something Substanital To Eat! The Breakfast Was Also A Little Disappointing In That The Poaches Eggs On The Eggs Benedict Were Hardboiled Which Spoilt It A Little.,,,,,,
,505,I Felt That The Food Was Very Expensive And Very Small  And We ( My Sister And I) Are Not Big Eaters. The Food We Ate Was Delicious But For That Price Should Have Perhaps Included Some Vegetables .,,,,,,
,506,See My Previous Comments Re Our Dining Experience.,,,,,,
,511,Dinner Was Fantastic But Breakfast Was Poor .,,,,,,
,518,The Food Is Probably Very Good  But There Wasn't A Great Deal That Appealed To Me  I Had Pork And It Was A Little Dry  Our Starters Were Very Good.,,,,,,
,519,The Breakfast Service Was Better On The Friday Morning Than The Saturday.,,,,,,
,520,The Service Was Pleasant But Extremely Slow. At Breakfast We Had To Wait A Long Time Before Our Tea And Food Arrived. It Would Be A Good Idea To Serve The Drinks And Toast First  Prior To The Hot Breakfast. I Think They Were Short Staffed In The Morning. There Were No Pastries Although They Were On The Menu. The English Breakfast Would Have Benefited From Some Beans. We Had The Tasting Menu In The Evening. It Was Ok But We Were Left A Little Hungry.,,,,,,
,522,Gin Menu Fantastic,,,,,,
,523,The Portions Of Some Of The Dishes Were Quite Small E.G. There Was Only One Ravioli In The Starter.  It Was Tasty Though But There Could At Least Have Been Three Of Them.,,,,,,
,524,Very Impressed With Team For Accomodating For My Other Half Who Had A Fish Allergy At Such Short Notice.,,,,,,
,526,Waiting Staff Were Helpful And Friendly.  We Were A Little Baffled  As We Ordered Eggs Benedict For Breakfast But This Came With Spinach Which We Would Normally Be Called Eggs Florentine.  We Queried This But Were Told (Very Nicely) That This Was Eggs Benedict.  This Is Hardly A Life Threatening Experience But Just Slightly Odd.,,,,,,
,529,Breakfast Buffet Table On Sunday Morning 10.00Am Very Disappointing. No Pastries  No Individual Fruit Layer Yoghurts As Per Previous Visits  Run Out Of Fruit Salad  Buffet Table Covered In Crumbs And Used Weetabix Wrappers. Communal Yoghurt From Pot Very Thin And Low Quality. Whole Experience Smelled Of An Economy Drive By Hotel. Spoiled An Otherwise Excellent Stay. Wrong Lasting Impression To Give Guests Just Before They Depart.,,,,,,
,531,Amazing Puddings. The Eggs Benedict For Breakfast Was Phenomenal.,,,,,,
,545,Tuna Was Unavailable Once Ordered...Hash Browns Were Unavailable At Breakfast...Portions Very Small....Main Course Of Lamb Dull And Boring,,,,,,
,548,The Food Was Very Good And The Barman Very Knowledgeable About The Vaste Number Of Gin's! The Room Lacked A Little Atmospehere  Although Again  I Appreciate This Was Mid Week And Obviously Not Your Busiest Time. It's Such A Shame That You Are Unable To See The Bar From The Seating Area.,,,,,,
,549,The Fresh Fruit On Offer Needs To Be Greater And The Fruit Salad Topped Up Regularly.,,,,,,
,551,Fantastic Experience Couldn't Have Been Improved Upon,,,,,,
,553,The Whole Experience Is Very Good From Explaining All The Different Gins To Telling Us A Lovely Table By The Window Is Ready When We Were. We Have Previously Dined In The Restaurant And Both Menus Are Very Good  So Is The Food Of Course.,,,,,,
,554,We Found That The Sweets We Sampled Did Not Reach The High Standard Of The Rest Of The Meal.,,,,,,
,557,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Evening Meal The Food Was Lovely The Staff Very Nice Would Love To Eat There Again ,,,,,,
,558,Food Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,561,Took Two Hours To Serve Up The 3 Course Dinner. Service Was Slow On The Night We Stayed Due To A `Melt Down In The Kitchen. Staff Seemed Rushed. Bread Rolls Were Too Small. Forgot Our Side Dish.,,,,,,
,565,We Had The Gourmet Tasting Menu - We Feel That The Waiters Rushed Us Through The Courses - We Wanted To Make An Evening Of It.  Also Your Wine Waiter Filled Up Our Glasses To High - A Good Sommelier Would Refill The Glasses Gradually.  Pity Really As The Food Is Good And Well Presented.,,,,,,
,567,You Are Fortunate In Having The Services Of An Excellent Chef .,,,,,,
,571,The Dining Room Felt A Little Cold And Canteen Like.,,,,,,
,572,Particularly Liked Dining In The Courtyard In Summer.,,,,,,
,573,We Had The Taster Menu But Fennel Appeared To Feature More Than Once.  The First Half Of The Meal Was Served Almost Too Quickly And Then We Seemed To Wait A Long Time For The Final Courses During Which Time We Had Finished Our Wine And Water But Weren't Offered Anything Else.,,,,,,
,575,Eating Off A Slate (Roof Tile?) Is Not A Pleasant Experience And Doesn't Enhance The Look Or Taste Of The Food.  Cutlery Coming Into Contact With Slate ..... Very Unpleasant.  They Are Also Very Difficult For The Waiters To Pick Up When Clearing The Table.  Rather Too Many Smears And Blobs Decorating The Main Courses.  I Queried What I Thought Was A Missing Ingredient In One Course  Only To Be Told That It Was Present In The Form Of Two Penny-Sized Blobs Of Sauce.,,,,,,
,576,Waiting Staff A Bit Over-Attentive And Confused By Us Wanting To Try Different Gins.,,,,,,
,578,The Evening Meal Was Excellent  Breakfast Not So Good. The Service For Breakfast Was Slow And The Staff Seemed Harassed. The Toast Was Burnt On One Side And Uncooked On The Other. When I Pointed This Out To The Waitress She Was Quite Aggressive And Said The Toaster Had Broken And She Could Not Go Out And Buy A New Toaster As She Would Like To Because She Was Fed Up With The Situation. She Felt The Management Had Not Dealt With It Quickly Enough. I Appreciated Her Frustration But Was Unhappy With Her Tone To Me.,,,,,,
,582,At Dinner The Waiter Spilt A Bottle Of Tonic Water All Over The Table  Narrowly Missing Soaking And Ruining My Partner's Phone.  At Breakfast We Had To Ask Several Times For Cutlery  Tea Etc  Although It Was Not Busy.,,,,,,
,584,Items Not Available In The Menu Alternatives Offered But Different Things Served,,,,,,
,588,The Restaurant Staff Were All Well-Trained  Courteous And Helfpul. I Would Single Out The Barman/Sommelier/Waiter On The 25Th Who Served Us In The Gin Bar And Was Very Knowledgeable  Then Was Also Helpful With Food And Wine.,,,,,,
,589,The Food Was To A Very High 'Fine Dining' Standard. The Only Adverse Comment Was To Do With Our Drinks Canapã©S. These Were Delicious But We Found It Almost Impossible To Eat The Cream Cheese Quenelles. I Was Told We Should Use The Potato Wedge  However In My Case This Was Too Fragile And We Ended Up Trying To Enjoy The Cheese With A Cocktail Stick !! I Should Say This Is Merely A Comment And Not A Complaint. Over All The Food Superb The Best I've Had For A Long Time.,,,,,,
,591,I Considered The Wine To Be Very Expensive.  The Food Portions Of Food Were Woefully Inadequate. I And My Wife Had To Find Secondary Food Outlet As We Both Felt Hungry After The Meal. Not The Experience We Anticipated. Some Staff English Language Was Questionable.,,,,,,
,592,Worthy Of An Inclusion In The Gfg.,,,,,,
,595,The Breakfasts Were Alledgedly ''Cooked To Order''  Not The Case On Monday 6 May  Very Poor Quality  Extremely Dry As If It Had Been Heated Up.,,,,,,
,599,We Had The Gourment Experience For Dinner But Felt That We Would Go For The Al La Carte Meal Next Time As Felt That Not All Of The Food Was To Our Liking And Too Many Courses.,,,,,,
,605,The Dinner Was Nice But I Wouldn't Quite Call It 'Exceptional',,,,,,
,606,Ordering Of Dinner Was Rather Slow And Haphazard. I Had To Request The Wine List Twice. Staff Originally Tried To Seat Us In The Empty Courtyard Gin Bar For Dinner And Initially Told Us The Dining Room Was Full. After Complaining To The Manager We Were Moved Into The Dining Room. Breakfast Was A Rather Disappointing Affair As The Food Was Not Freshly Cooked As We Would Expect. Crockery Was More Fitting For A Cafã© And Not What We Are Used To At The Feathers.,,,,,,
,612,The Vegetarian Main Course Said Baked Celeriac - It Came As Baked Onion!,,,,,,
,621,Overall Good But My Husband Had Scallops To Start..But 1 Scallop And There Was Part Of Another Scallop On Plate...This As First Course Was Disappointing..Although Overall Food Good But Not As Good As Last Tie. Coffee And Chocs Excellent..But Did Cost 9.50.,,,,,,
,628,Would Have Liked A Little More Description Of Tasting Menu As Each Course Arrived.,,,,,,
,635,Excellent As Usual Thank You.,,,,,,
,636,We Have Been Coming To Your Hotel For Nearly 20 Years And This Time The Food Served Was Average/Gastro Pub At Best-Huge Disappointment Unlikely We Will Come Again Or Recommend To Our Friends Anymore-A Real Shame.,,,,,,
,637,With The Dessert I Found That The Crackling Candy On It Was Overwhelming & I Was Unable To Eat It Which Was Disappointing. When The Waiter Asked Why I Hadn't Eaten It & I Explained He Didn't Really Seem To Understand My Problem With It. He Just Removed The Plate With No Offer Of A Replacement Maybe Without The Crackling Candy Or Something Different. I Found That A Little Unusual As In Most Other Restaurants I Have Eaten If There Is A Problem The Staff Are Usually Quite Eager To Resolve Them. However The Rest Of My Meal & My Husbands Meal Also Were Very Enjoyable.,,,,,,
,639,As A First Class Hotel And At Your Prices I Think You Should Serve 'Real' Orange Juice At Breakfast -,,,,,,
,641,My Wife And I Thoroughly Enjoyed Dinner.  The Food At All Times Was Excellent And The Wine List Well Selected Including Some More Mature Wines In The Lower Price Brackets - A Rarity.  My Only Negative Observation Was That Service At Breakfast Was Slow - I Suspect All Guests Came Down At About The Same Time Which Was Too Much For The Two Staff.,,,,,,
,645,Enjoyed Evening Meal And Breakgast  Staff Particularly Friendly,,,,,,
,651,Thought Food And Service Were Excellent  My Only Comment (I Had 5 Course Gourmet) Is The Courses Did Come Out Too Quick  Would Have Been Nice To Have A Longer Delay. However I Must Also Comment That My Wife Just Wanted A Steak ( And The Package Included The 5 Course) This Was Accommodated With No Fuss And Was Much Appreciated.,,,,,,
,652,Seem Really Short Staff And There Was An Argument In The Kithcen And No Gin Tasting Menu Avaliable,,,,,,
,654,No,,,,,,
,655,The Taster Menu Was Rather Adventurous In Taste Values And In Future I Would Select From The A La Carte Menu (Which Is Probably A Safer  More Cautious Option),,,,,,
,659,There Was A Dog Wandering Round In The Courtyard Gin Bar.  We Understand That Dogs Are Not Allowed In The Restaurant  And Consider That The  Same Rule Should Apply In The Courtyard. We Sat By A Window And It Was A Bit Cold.,,,,,,
,660,I Appreciated The Different Wines Accompanying The Gourmet Menu - Thank You,,,,,,
,664,Ate In The Restaurant Both Nights.  Chose A La Carte First Night And The Chef Made An Alternative Tasting Menu The Second Evening So We Could Try Different Dishes.  It Was Absolutely Fabulous.  Head Chef Was Off That Night And His Number Two Certainly Didnt Let Him Down,,,,,,
,668,Good Was Very Good But Not Excellent. We Had The Taster Menu And I Was Told That We Could Choose Our Courses When Booking Which Wasn't The Case. One Waiter Was Friendly  The Other Was Quite Cold.,,,,,,
,669,You Asked Our Dietary Preferences In Advance And Then For The Main Lamb Course At Dinner Included Bacon In The Cabbage Which We Had Specifically Indicated We Did Not Eat . The Lamb Was Not As Described On The Menu No Cornish Pasty   No Cauliflower Cheese It Was Returned Reheated And Dry With Cabbage Not A Very Appealing Main Course  Starters Excellent Sweets Quite Good   The Polish Waiter Was Excellent As Was The Barman In The Gin Bar But The Head Waiter Seemed To Vanish After He Had Taken Our Order And Never Reappeared To Apologise For The Main Course Mistake. He  Left It To His Charming Junior  Breakfast Service Erratic And Inattentive Smoked Salmon Leathery But Otherwise Good Liked The Fresh Orange Juice,,,,,,
,670,Superb Food And Very Helpful And Friendly Staff Both At Dinner And At Breakfast.,,,,,,
,673,I Am Vegetarian And Found A Few Nice Things On The Menu For Dinner  But The One Night The Chef Created A Special Dish For Me  A Vegetable Tart (With Fennel And Leek) That Was Delicious! Also The Beetroot Salad Appetizer Was Lovely. All The Looseleaf Teas Are Wonderful. I Very Much Appreciate Those Too. In General I Would Have Liked There To Be More Vegetarian Choices But The Chef Was Very Accommodating. The Breakfasts Were Wonderful! Thank You.,,,,,,
,677,Lack Of Organisation In Restaurant. Glasses Moved By One Person Then Returned Etc . Hard To Know Who Was In Charge Though Individuals Polite. Very Small Portion Of Turbot. Breakfast Order Undercooked  Then Overcooked. Just Simple Soft Boiled Eggs. Told A Refresh Of Tea And Coffee At Breakfast Would Be 'Extra' . Astonishing At That Price/Standard Of Hotel.,,,,,,
,679,It Would Be Nice To Have Some Different Choices Of Menu Each Evening. For The Breakfast  Each Morning We Were Told No Hash Browns Were Available. I Can Understand That For The One Morning But Surely The Chef Could Prepare Some For The Following Morning They Are Not Difficult To Prepare.,,,,,,
,681,We Were So Looking Forward To Our Evening Meal Experience  We Chose The Share Option Beef At Â£50  Thinking It Was Going To Be So Nice  Sadly Our Beef Was Tough And Chewy But The Reast Was All Ok. So I Guess You Now Know We're Very Disappointed  And Would Not Recommend That Dish To Others. We Would Consider Recommending The Feathers To Friends But Not The Beef  Otherwise A Lovey Stay  Just A Shame About The Meal. Hopefully You May Invite Us Back To Rectify That. Regards,,,,,,
,683,We Ate A Superb Dinner. We Also Ate A Small Lunch And I Was Disappointed Not To Be Given The Bread With My Soup I Was Expecting  But Others Had Some So We Shared. The Waiter's English Was Not The Best And He Did Not Seem To Understand Our Comment About The Bread. Nothing Spoilt The Food Though It Was Great.,,,,,,
,684,Could Not Offer Butter Substitute Apart From Oil-Not Very Good With Toast & Preserves,,,,,,
,688,Questions Are A Bit Loaded. We Had A Really Good Dinner But It Was Not Exceptional. What Was Really Lovely Was To Be Able To Eat In The Garden. That Made The Evening Special.,,,,,,
,689,We Selected To Have The Wine Matching  And Quite Often The Empty Glasses From The Previous Glasses Were Left On Our Table  Even After The Next Wine Was Served. Why They Could Not Take Them Away  I'm Not Sure. Also  Just From A Business Point Of View  At No Point Did Any Staff Try To Upsell Or Attach Further Sale. With This  I Mean That I Am Used To Waiting Staff Suggesting Extras. So  No One Suggested That We Have The Pairing Wines  It Was My Initiative. Also  It Would Have Been Nice Is Someone Asked Us What Our Favorite Wine Was From The 5 We Had  And Asked If We Would Like A Bottle. Or Maybe Would We Like To Upgrade From The Gourmet Menu To The Tasting Menu. Even When We Were Outside Having A Drink In The Afternoon  When The Waiter/Barman Came To Collect Our Empty Glasses  He Never Asked If We Would Like Another Drink. These Are All Areas Where You Could Generate Further Revenue  And Also Make You Customers Feel Like That Are Getting Attentive Service.,,,,,,
,690,At Dinner The Service Was Average. The Food Was Excellent. The Music Playing In The Background Was Appalling.  We Had A Package With A Free Breakfast Included However We Were Not Informed As To Whether Coffee Or Juice Would Be Included Even After Asking The Waiter. The Service Was Average Again  Friendly But Seemed To Be A Bit Unsure.,,,,,,
,692,The Food Was Well Presented And Acceptable  While Not Outstanding.,,,,,,
,694,Just A Few Chef Comments' From A Constructive Point Overall We Were Extremely Impressed With The Ala Carte Menu That We Dined From On 2 Evenings As A Chef Of 35 Years Myself  I Feel Your Overall Aa Rating Of 2 Rosettes Is Justified  However Parts Of Our Meals Were Extremely Well Thought Out  Well Balanced And Cooked To Perfection And Imho Deserve A 3 Aa Rating  What Does Unfortunately Let You Down  Is Your Pastry Is Not Quite To The Level Of Your Starters & Mains  That's Not To Say That It Was Not Enjoyable  Apart From The Pistachio Cake Dessert  The 3 Other Desserts Ordered Were To A Good Standard.  I Would Also  If I May  Advise That A Little More Consistacy Be Paid To Your Breakfast. Our Cooked Breakfast On Our First Morning Was Excellent  However We Were Quite Disappointed On Our Second Morning  With Over Cooked And Non Seasoned Scrambled Eggs  And An Egg Benedictine That Was Somewhat Bizzare  Served On A Hard Toasted Bread Roll? Not An English Muffin As Would Expect  2 Very Undercooked Poached Eggs On Top Of Ham And Spinach? ( Spinach Is Egg Floretine) Hollandaise Sauce And Then Topped With Your Chefs Favourite Micro Cress.( Chef  Please Use In Moderation  As You'll Get Heavily Marked Down On Your Next Aa Visit  As It Formed Part Of Every Dish We Ate Over The Weekend) Otherwise A Most Enjoyable Restaurant Experience  Well Done To All The Catering Staff; You Have The Makings Of A Great Restaurant   ,,,,,,
,703,The Service Was Very Slow On Our First Night Having To Wait Nearly An Hour For Our Main Course! A Sorbet Was Offered!!,,,,,,
,705,Ar Dinner We Found The Service A Little Too Attentive And Way To Many 'You're Welcome' ..... Breakfast On The Other Hand Was A Little Lacking In Service In Regard To No Staff On Arrival & Having To Find One To Order Our Breakfast (He Was Clearing Tables...) We Were In A Bit Of A Hurry And When We Told Him He Was Very Accommodating.,,,,,,
,706,We Have Taken The Gin Menu Twice. The First Time It Was Exceptional  The Second It Appeared To Have Dropped In Quality (I Even Pointed Out Missing Items - Like Gin Jelly). Have You Changed Kitchen Staff&Gt;,,,,,,
,710,Food And Service Was Good During The Evening Meal  But The Bill Took Too Long To Arrive. (Over 10 Minutes)  This Is A Shame As It Leaves The Lasting Impression Of The Evening As Poor. The Bill Was Also The Wrong One For Our Table. Please Try To Get The Bill To Your Guests As Soon As They Ask For It  And Do Not Leave Them Waiting. The Breakfast Staff Were Polite But Very Slow At Getting Tea/Toast And Cooked Items Out. It Was A Shame As The Food Was Good.,,,,,,
,711,Breakfast Not S Good As Last Time. Not As Stylishly Presented. Toast Was Awful Hard And Dry And Brittle. Not Quick In Filling Fruit Yogurt Etc At Buffet Tasting Menu Dinner Was Good  Just 5- 10 Minutes Too Slow Between Courses. Whole Meal Was 2.5 Hours Therefore Half An Hour Per Course When Only Tasting Portions - Needs To Be Quicker. Sevice Was Pleasant But A Little Perfuntory. No Interaction,,,,,,
,714,One Of The Best !,,,,,,
,716,Very Limited Menu.,,,,,,
,720,Scallops Was A Full Scallop And A Piece Of Scallop Which Is Not Very Clever Of You! Not Sure Why At Least 2 Full Scallops Were Served.  A Starter Portion Is Normally 3 And At Â£12 You Are At The Top Of The Pricing!,,,,,,
,721,Tasting Menu ...Most Courses Were Put On The Table Without Explanation Of The Content. Breakfast Was Very Slow Service And When It Did Arrive Only Half Of My Choice Arrived. The Buffet Was Depleted And Not Replenished.,,,,,,
,724,My Aunt And Uncle Are Still Talking About The Tasting Menu And How They Very Much Enjoyed It !!!!,,,,,,
,728,Wonderful Food Although A Tad Repetive In The Eveing.,,,,,,
,729,We Were Very Disappointed With The Taster Menu. Sorry To Say But The Meal Was Such A Let Down  Most Of The Courses Came With The Same Micro Salad Garnish  Service Was Good But Rather Rushed. We Asked For A Few Minutes Break Before The Next Course But It Still Arrived Within 2 Mins Of The Last One Breakfast: Was The Scrambled Egg Made Up From A Powder  It Did Not Look Taste Or Feel Like Fresh Eggs  We Would Love To Come And Stay Again But Don't Think We Would Eat In The Resturant,,,,,,
,735,The Service Was Very Hit And Miss. At Times It Was Over Zealous. At Other Times There Was No One To Be Seen. The Music In The Dining Room Was The Same Eric Clapton Tune Over And Over Again. It Was The Same Music At Breakfast.,,,,,,
,742,No.,,,,,,
,743,The Service Was Slow At Times,,,,,,
,746,We Had The 5 Course Gourmet Menu Which Was Interesting  But The Salmon Course Was Cold And Very Rare.,,,,,,
,752,Superb In Every Way,,,,,,
,754,The Breakfast Was A Little Overcooked As Though It Had Been Kept Warm Rather Then Cooked Fresh.,,,,,,
,755,Accomplished Cooking And Excellent Service. Altogether A Very Enjoyable Experience. Very Good Winelist.,,,,,,
,759,Honestly  We Were Disappointed. I Ordered A Martini As An Aperitif And You Had No Vermouth...In A Gin Bar! The Staff Were Mixed In Their Experience...The Young Ones Needed More Training Re: Pouring Wine/Where To Place Items. A Course Was Brought To Us And The Table Hadn't Been Cleared From The Previous Course.  The Breakfast On Sunday Morning Was Incredibly Slow.,,,,,,
,762,None Other Than Already Mentioned. I Will Be Back!,,,,,,
,763,Gin Fusion Menu Was Fantastic. I've Never Been A Gin Drinker But I Am Now Converted!,,,,,,
,766,We Had The Five Course Taster Meal. The Food Was Of A High Quality But Very Small Quantities. We Both Felt Like We Could Have Eaten Alot More. Please Note Either Of Us Have Big Appetites And Have Eaten Many Taster Menus At Other Restaurants. My Husband Did Ask To See If The Chef Could Cook Him A Further Large Course Such As Steak But The Kitchen Had Shut And They Could Only Offer A Cheeseboard. When Ordering Wine I Asked For A Bottle Of Veuve Cliquot And Pointed To The Exact Type On The Wine List. However  When The Bottle Arrived At The Table It Was Presented To My Husband Whom Assumed That Was What I Chose And Accepted It. However We Had Been Brought The Vintage Which Was Â£25 More. We Didnt Realise This Untill We Checked The Bill On Leaving The Hotel. I Do Hope This Was A Genuine Mistake And Not The Hotel Trying To Upsell. We Arrived At Breakfast At 9.45Am And Were Asked To Sit At A Table With Crumbs And Place Settings From The Previous Customers Which The Waiter Cleaned Up As I Sat There. I Couldnt See Why I Couldnt Have Been Sat At A Clean Table? The Breakfast Was Disappointing Apart From The Staff Who Were Very Friendly And Attentive. I Received The Wrong Fruit Juice  The Toast Was White Not Brown  The Kitchen Had Run Out Of Bananas For The Hotcake And Banana. As A Consequence We Were Offered Berries In The Hotcakes Instead. What Came Was A Dry Hotcake With A Very Slight Smear Of Jam Inside. The Coffee Was Extremely Weak Unlike The Coffee I Had The Night Before.   ,,,,,,
,767,The Issue With The Food Was That It Took Over An Hour To Be Served After Ordering. Far To Long Especially As Other Tables Were Served Before Us Although They Arrived After Us. We Had No Dietary Requirements So I Don't Know Why It Took So Long,,,,,,
,771,Some Was Exceptional  Some Less So.  Some Staff Were Great (Tall Chap With Glasses Who Was Gin Expert Went The Extra Mile) Others Less So. Had To Wait 20 Mins For Cup Of Tea At Table One Morning.,,,,,,
,774,We Were Very Disappointed With The Food In The Evening. Lobster Ravioli Was Completely Tasteless As Were The Vegetables Served With The Lamb.  The Restaurant Manager Seemed Rather Harassed And Service Was A Bit Haphazard.,,,,,,
,779,Disappointed. One Starter Was Served With Blue Cheese Missing. Lobster Ravioli Had Little Lobster Filling And Was Tasteless. Not Asked To Taste The Wine And Was Not Poured. The Serving Staff Need More Training.,,,,,,
,787,As Part Of Our 123 Package The Offer Stated That We Had A Complimentary Gin Cocktail. My Wife And I Are Not Particularly Gin Drinkers But The Gentleman Running The Bar Mentioned That We Could Have Any Other Drink We Liked And Offered My Wife A Glass Of Champagne. Superb  As That Is Her Favourite Drink. I Had A Glass Of Red Wine. That Was A Welcome And Delightful Start To Our Meal With You. Thank You.  ,,,,,,
,788,The Food Was Lovely. One Of The Staff Forgot To Clear Our Plates Away After The Entree But We Laughed It Off When The Mains Arrived And The Staff Were Trying To Serve Our Food.  They Were Apologetic But Very Polite And Dealt With It.  It Didn't Ruin Our Experience.  Staff Were Discreet But Attentive.,,,,,,
,796,As Above Breakfast Buffet Was Lacking,,,,,,
,797,See Previous Comments,,,,,,
,801,Again  Superb. Beautifully Presented And Well Cooked.,,,,,,
,803,First Night We Were Told The Chicken Was Off The Menu   Second Night Still Off The Menu We Were Told That The Chef Was Changing The Menus And That Was The Reason.  Poached Egg Must Have A Piece Of Toast Under It  Surely Not Just Put On The Plate.  ,,,,,,
,804,Friendly Staff  We Really Liked The Barman From Poland  He Introduced Us To Two New Gins.,,,,,,
,805,Extremely Good Service.,,,,,,
,806,The Bacon And Sausage Were Very Dry And Appeared To Have Been Kept Warm As Opposed Freshly Cooked. ,,,,,,
,813,The Gentlemen Who We Served Us At Breakfast Was Delightful,,,,,,
,814,Very Good Food And Service Served To A Very High Standard.,,,,,,
,816,The Staff Was Very Well Trained And Professional.,,,,,,
,823,Portion Size Improvement On Previous Visits,,,,,,
,826,Perhaps Another Starter As Only Three,,,,,,
,829,The Food Was A 6 Out Of 10. Ok But Not Memorable.,,,,,,
,830,Possibly May Need To Look At Breakfast Portion Sizes - I Know You Have To Keep An Eye On Costs But 1 Small Mushroom And Only 2 Triangles Of Toast (So 1 Slice) And No Hash Browns Weren't Quite To The Standards I'd Hoped For. ,,,,,,
,832,Comments As Previously Made On This Form.,,,,,,
,833,Excellent Atmosphere  Great Food  Wonderful Service.,,,,,,
,838,My Husband Has Recently Had A Heart Attack And Wasn't Up To Having Breakfast Downstairs - Staff Very Happy To Bring To Our Room (33) - A Lovely Treat To Have Breakfast In Bed!! Again Thank You.,,,,,,
,843,5 Course Tasting Menu Delicious. Fresh Fruit Salad At Breakfast Disappointing ,,,,,,
,844,The Gin And Tonic Recommended Was Excellent.  The Food Was Slightly Too Salted For My Taste But Not Unpleasant.  I Sateyd Two Nights And So The Chopices Were Limited - A Few More Main Courses Or A Changing Menu Would Be Welcome.,,,,,,
,846,The Waiter Was Great And Recommended A Lovely Gin. He Made Our Evening.,,,,,,
,847,See Previous Comments,,,,,,
,848,Upon My Request For A Meat Free Meal  I Was Not Disappointed In Any Way.  We Both Felt Like We Had A Very Special Treat!,,,,,,
,850,Dinner Service Was Poor For The Second Time  Head Waiter Was Grumpy As Was The Waitress. It Doesn't Matter How Good The Food Is If The Person Serving It Is Clearly Not Enjoying Themselves.   Breakfast Was Great Staff Very Friendly,,,,,,
,852,Very Pleasantly Surprised With The Content Of The Menu And The Quality And Presentation Of The Food. Excellent Value For Money,,,,,,
,854,Dinner Was Not Memorable  Breakfast Was,,,,,,
,857,Let Down By Dining Room Staff. ,,,,,,
,858,As Before   Lovely Setting  Good Food  The Service Could Be Sharper,,,,,,
,862,Told We Had Booked The Taster Menu~ Untrue. Used The A La Carte With Its Limited Offering . Seasonal Greens Were Ordered As A Side And Were Not Edible As Was The Over Balance Of Greens Already On Plate. Waitress Was Pleasant But Obviously Inexperienced . The Hovering Suited Male Was Not Interested In His Customers,,,,,,
,866,Both Evening Meal And Breakfast Were Excellent. We Did Have Three Attempts On Getting Our Evening Meal  But It Was  Not An Issue And The Staff Were Very Good In The Way They Handled The Mistake. Breakfast Was Obviously Cooked To Order And Very Tasty,,,,,,
,869,Outstanding!  I Need The Recipe For Those Duck Fat Potatoes!!!  We Loved Absolutely Every Meal And Were Very Impressed With Our Dining Experiences.,,,,,,
,871,The Staff Were Very Attentive ,,,,,,
,876,We Were Looking Forward To The Pancakes For Breakfast  But These Were "Finished" When We Arrived  My Wife's Next Choice Was Also Off The Menu  So She Went For The Kippers Which Were A Nice Third Choice. There Were No Water Glasses On The Tables And We Had To Ask For Them Which Took Ten Minutes As They Were Too Busy To Check On Us! We Also Had To Ask For Orange Juice  And When I Asked For A Coffee  It Never Arrived  And The Restaurant  Shut With No One Checking If Everything Was Ok!  Dinner Was Excellent And Very Enjoyable - The Gin Fusion Menu Was Superb  But The Desert Was A Let Down And A Complete Contrast To The Starter And Meal - You Would've Got A 'Strongly Agree' If The Desert Was Up To The Same Standard.,,,,,,
,877,The Sampling Menu Was Good  However The Fillet Beef Was Really Not Up To Scratch... It Was Cooked Perfectly But A Rather Tough Piece Of Meat. The Dessert - Chocolate -  Was A Bit Too Large & Very Rich. ,,,,,,
,882,Breakfast Wasn't Particularly Allergy Friendly - As A Lacto An Gluten Intolerant Person It Was Quite Tricky Finding Something To Eat. I'd Suggest Spelt Bread As An Easy Solution With Salmon And Eggs For Example. ,,,,,,
,884,The Food Was Not Of Previous High Standard. The Service Was Very Slow   Even At Breakfast - I Do Appreciate It Was Being Individually Prepared. The Staff Were Friendly But Not Professional.,,,,,,
,887,Dinner Was Average.....And Disappointing For The Price. Breakfast Self-Service Was Fair. The Cooked Breakfast On Both Mornings Was Not As Ordered  Despite Repeating To Ensure The Waitress Had Taken The Order Correctly. Breakfast Took Far To Long To Come Give That You Were Well Staffed And Had A Low Cover Count Both Days When We Ate. Coffee Was Very Poor On The Sunday. ,,,,,,
,889,New Year's Eve Was Great. However We Mentioned At Reception The Previous Evening Being Somewhat Scatty And Remarkably Slow. We Were A Party Of 8 - Not That Many. 3/4 Hour After We Sat Down We Still Had No Bread. The Meal Was So Slow We Left At About 11 Rather Than Wait For Coffee. The Youngest Of Our Party Was 13 So We Didn't Want Such A Late Night. We Were Brought The Wrong Food Several Times And Cheeses Came Long After The Other Desserts  So It Was Not A Relaxing Evening. ,,,,,,
,890,At Breakfast We Didn't Notice Any Fruit Juice Labels.  This Would Be Helpful For Dietary Requirements.,,,,,,
,891,It Was All Fine And Attentive.,,,,,,
,892,The Gala Dinner Food Was Better Than Expected Being Almost Fine Dining Standard - For Such Large Number Catering It Was Exceptional. Breakfast (Not Brunch?) Again Was Excellent  With A Very Good And Interesting Choice Of Dishes.,,,,,,
,893,We Ate In The Restaurant On The Saturday Night And The Service Was Very Good  The Food Was Fine But Not Outstanding. The Breakfast Service Seemed A Little Chaotic On The Sunday Morning But We Were In No Rush So That Didn't Matter And The Food Was Good. On Monday Morning The Service Was Much Better And The Food Was Good Again. ,,,,,,
,894,We Thought The Dinner Was Excellent And Interesting Especially For Me As A Vegetarian. To Have Such Choice Is Unusual.,,,,,,
,895,We Found The Food Improved On Our Last Visit - Which Was Great To See.  However Just A Couple Of Things To Note: Breakfasts - The Buffet Style Choice Was Most Improved And Didn't Run Out Of Things Such As The Pastries  If You Came Down Later To Breakfast.  The Cooked Breakfasts Were Good Too.  We Were There As Part Of The New Year Package And It Perhaps Might Have  Been An Idea To Give The Guests A Small Timetable Of Times For Meals (As Most Of Us Welcomed The Later Breakfast/Brunch Idea On New Year's Day But We Didn't Know About It Ahead Of Time)  We Were Also Unaware Of The Gin Tasting Session That Was Included In The Package But We Weren't Able To Join  As We Found Out About It Too Late.  Courtyard Gin Bar - The Recommendations On The Gins Were Excellent And We Really Enjoyed The Knowledge And The Recommends On Each Night.  We Did Dine There On One Of Our Nights And Had An Ok Meal........ It Would Have Been Nice To Have Seen Something A Little Lighter (Rather Than Just A Choice Of Burger Or Fish And Chips Or Pasta).  Also The Fish We Did Have Was Rather Over Cooked Which Made It Quite Dry.  Restaurant - Both The New Year Eve Package Dinners Were Interesting  But We Did Find It Hard To Make A Wine Choice For The New Year's Eve Dinner  As There Was Both The Need For A White And A Red Wine  But As There Was Only Two Of Us  We Didn't Want To Order Two Whole Bottles And Also The Toasting Champagne.  Could We Suggest That Perhaps You Included A Suggested Accompanying Wine By The Glass With Each Course  Which I Am Sure That A Number Of The Other Couples May Have Welcomed Too?  Your Wine List Has A Very Limited Number Of Wines By The Glass Or Even Half Bottles.  (Just One Small Point About The Canapes - It Would Have Been Nice To See Them Served With Paper Napkins - Everyone Was Dressed For Dinner And Had No Where To Wipe Sticky Fingers From The Canapes.)  We Do Love The Tea And Coffee Service - Please Do Keep This.  It Was Always Prompt And Beautifully Served.  ,,,,,,
,896,The Service Was A Bit Slow On Our First Night  However The Staff Were Apologetic And Sympathetic.,,,,,,
,897,Disappointed That Flora Or Other Non Dairy Spread Was Not Available At Breakfast. ,,,,,,
,898,Very Nice Food; However The Dinner Menu Was Almost Exactly The Same On Our Second Night  Which Was A Pity. This May Have Been Due To Dining In The Bar Or Because It Was The Weekend  Nevertheless It Would Have Been Nice To See A Completely Different Choice.,,,,,,
,899,Very Good Food ,,,,,,
,901,The Tasting Menu Was Good But Not Exciting - But There Were 2 Large Parties Dining That Night. The A La Carte We Had The Next Evening Was Excellent  Well Cooked And Presented.,,,,,,
,904,Food Was Very Good But Service Was Alright. No Muffins For The Eggs Benedict. ,,,,,,
,905,Dinner Fabulous Except For Very Slow Service. Breakfast Average. My Smoked Haddock Was Raw  Not Smoked!,,,,,,
,907,Please See Earlier Comments Regarding Service.,,,,,,
,909,It Would Have Been V Helpful If The Wine Waiter Had Actually Discussed The Wine Choices That Went With Each Course - Likewise At The Bar More Interaction About The Choice Of Gins Would Have Been Very Helpful.,,,,,,
,910,Our Main Meal And Wine Was Very Good  But Dessert Was Less Than Ideal.   It Was Not As Described On The Menu Or By The Waiter When Asked.  And When Questioned  The Waiter Was Somewhat Dismissive.  In Fairness  He Did Offer To Bring Another Dessert - But The Selection For Dessert Was Not Very Good So There Was Nothing Else We Wanted.   Also  After We Arrived And Settled In - I Came Downstairs To Make A Dinner Reservation With Reception.  When We Arrived For Dinner They Did Not Have Our Name Down On The Reservation List...The Wait Staff Seemed Confused And Hesitant.  Although Not A Big Deal...And They Sat Us ...It Was A Bit Offputting For The Beginning Of The Experience. ,,,,,,
,918,Waiting Staff Did Not Know Their Food  Tasting Menu Was Just Put Down And When Asked The Waiting Staff Did Not Know What The Dishes Were. Fish Course Was Served Cold. The Wine Flight Arrived After Each Course Rather Than Before Or With It. The Toast For Breakfast Arrived After Hot Food Finished Despite Asking For It With,,,,,,
,922,Evening Meal (5 Course Tasting Menu) Was Entirely Satisfactory  Good Rather Than Outstanding. Breakfast Service Was Very Slow (Though You Were Busy And The Food  Particularly The Bacon Was Very Dry. ,,,,,,
,925,See Earlier Comments!,,,,,,
,928,Dinner Seemed A Little Less 'Special' Than Previous Visits  More Straightforward Food But Still Good.,,,,,,
,929,Shall Return  In The Future - Better Than Expected,,,,,,
,932,None,,,,,,
,933,Whislt The Service In The Restuarant Was Friendly It Was Quite Slow And We Often Had To Ask Or Remind The Waitress Of Things
Eg.
- We Had To Ask Twice For Some Water
- Our Gins Did Not Arrive With The Starters For The Gin Fusion Menu - Again We Had To Ask
- At Breakfast We Waited A Long Time For A Waitress And Then She Asked For Our Order Before Even Showing Us The Menu
- When The Breakfast Arrived We Didn't Actually Get The Items We Had Asked For ,,,,,,
,934,Background Music Was Too Loud -- Not Really Necessary In Rooms With Such A Pleasant Ambience.

Proper Coat Hangers In The Bedroom Would Be Welcome.

It Was Not Clear Whether We Could Have Ordered Our Meal Over Drinks (Which We Prefer) Before Going In To Dinner.

To Nit Pick: Orange Juice At Breakfast Was Not Freshly Squeezed As Promised.,,,,,,
,935,The Egg Was Requested To Be Left Off One Of Our One Of My Dinner Courses  But It Came With The Egg.
The Black Pudding At Breakfast Was Under Cooked,,,,,,
,936,Please See Previous Comments Re Food. ,,,,,,

,941,Dining Area Lacking It Atmosphere  Too White/Bright  Need Muted Lighting In The Evening,,,,,,
,943,Waiter Service Was Very Professional And Attentive.,,,,,,
,944,Just One Young Female Waitress  Didn't Speak To Us At All And Rushed Us A Bit  Which We Really Only Noticed Because Everyone Else Was So Friendly And Polite. However I Must Add That This Did Not Have Any Real Impact On A Fabulous Dining Experience.,,,,,,
,945,The Gin Fusion Menu At Dinner Was A Brilliant Experience - Delicious Food And So Well Matched With The Different Gins. 
Breakfast Was Very Tasty Too - Our Only Quibble Was That Portion Size Was Not Especially Generous (I Chose Not To Have The Sausage  Bacon Or Black Pudding  So It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had A Second Egg).,,,,,,
,946,Did Not Like The Hash Brown At Breakfast,,,,,,
,947,We Had Burgers So The Word "Exceptional" Does Not Seem Appropriate,,,,,,
,949,Very Well Presented ,,,,,,
,951,Would Recommend That When Using The Private Dining Room That If Staying The Guests Using The Private Dining Room Are Put Above This Area Therefore Not Disturbing Other Guests Staying. ,,,,,,
,952,We Had A Very Enjoyable Meal But We Cannot Agree That It Was Exceptional,,,,,,
,962,The  Buffet Selection Was Disappointing  The Bacon Difficult To Eat And Egg Had So Much Pepper  I Couldn't Eat It.,,,,,,
,963,Breakfast Buffet Selection Was Disappointing The Bacon Difficult To Eat And Pepper Used Too Liberally On The Egg.,,,,,,

,76,It Is A Nice Place To Bring People But Some People From The Various Countries My People Are From Don't Appreciate An Old Building.  It Is Hard For Them To See Small  Dark  Overly Hot With No Air Con As Luxurious And To Have Minimal Service At The Bar And Almost No Service At Breakfast Is To Them Unacceptable.  I Discovered That One Of Your Rooms - It May Be 25? Is Awful And I Would Never Have Put Anyone In That Room If I Had Known What It Was Like.  To Have No Window  A Large Air Con Unit Dominating The Room  Powering Out Cold Air And The Option Of Not Having It On Meaning You Are Styfling Hot Is Not Acceptable At All.,,,,,,

,24,The Young Lady At Reception,,,,,,
,25,On Entering The Gin Bar On Our First Evening  We Were In Need Of An Extra 2 Chairs.  One Of The Young Guys From Reception (Who Had Come To Take A Couple Of Logs) Was There And So I Asked Him If He Would Be Able To Organise The Chairs For Us As We Were Waiting To Be Seated.  He Told Me To Speak To The Bar Man (Who Already Had A Queue Of People And Was Very Busy) And Walked Away.  I Thought This Was A Tad Rude.   We Had To Wait 10 Minutes Before My Husband And Daughter Could Sit Down.  I Did Not Think It My Husband's Job To Cart 2 Chairs Over The Heads Of People Who Were Already Sitting Quietly Drinking In The Next Room.,,,,,,

,32,Ana - Very Helpful Pre- Arrival The Head Waiter In The Evening Was Excellent - Frecnh Maybe  Didn't Catch His Name The Head Waiter In Breakfast (Wears A Suits - 40'S In Age I'd Say) Was Very Helpful And Attentive),,,,,,
,36,The Gentleman On Reception When We Left. He Was Apologetic About Our Toilet Smelling Of Urine And Seemed Genuine.,,,,,,
,42,The Young Woman On Reception In The Mornings Could Not Have Been More Helpful  And In Particular She Pointed Out  Quite Without Pressure From Me  That There Was A Room Discount For Single Occupancy. I Said That  Having Booked The Room In Good Faith At The Full Price  I Should Pay That Amount  But She Insisted  And Amended My Account. I Was Impressed And Grateful.,,,,,,
,44,Lewis Was Very Helpful With Our Booking And Was A Pleasure To Meet Him,,,,,,
,45,Service Was Flawless But Not In Your Face. Just Nice And Relaxed.,,,,,,
,46,We Don't Have Their Names But  (A) The Well Built Gentleman Who Carried Our Cases Uptstairs And  (B) The Maitre De In Charge Of The Dining Room,,,,,,

,69,The Receptionist Was Very Good And Also The Gentleman In The Bar Who Took Our Order For Drinks In The Bar And Restaurant Was Very Personable And Knowledgeable About The Wines. We Had Asked For A Glass Of Wine To Suit Each Of Our Selections And Courses. He Explained Very Well What The Wines Were For Our Starter And Why They Had Been Chosen. Unfortunately  Someone Else Brought The Wine For Our Main Course And Just Plonked Them Down Without Telling Us What They Were!,,,,,,
,72,Receptionist Who Greeted Us And Check Us Out Was Very Sweet And Friendly,,,,,,
,74,The Bar Manager For His Excellent Gin Tutorial; We Went Away Better Educated And With Our Future G&T Shopping Refined!,,,,,,

,82,Female Receptionist In The Morning Was Particularly Pleasant And Helpful.,,,,,,
,86,Lack Of Staff Was The Key.  They Were All Polite  But So Rushed That They Could Not Be Attentive  Or Make Guests Feel Really Well Looked After.  Danny The Restaurant Manager Was Excellent And Clearly Knows What Is Needed  If Only He Had The Resources To Accomplish It.  The Fact That The Hotel Manager  Pete  Was Having To Serve And Clear  At Breakfast Exemplifies The Problems!,,,,,,
,88,The Fellow Behind The Bar Who Has A Terrific Knowledge Regarding The Range Of Gins You Offer. Sorry  Can't Remember His Name But He Was Extremely Informative And Professional.,,,,,,

,111,Actually They Were All Good. Breakfast Chap Very Good,,,,,,
,113,Guy On Reception When I Arrived   May Be Called Darren Or Warren?,,,,,,
,122,The Husband And Wife Team You Have Are Very Good - And Have Some Great Hospitality Skills.  James In The Bar Was Very Knowledgeable But Not Very Presentable And No One Else Appears To Know About The Gin Bar If He Isn't There.  As This Is One Of Your 'Selling Points' I Would Have Expected That All Staff Who Are Working In The Bar Have The Same High Level Of Knowledge.,,,,,,
,125,All The Staff Were Engaged And Helpful.,,,,,,
,135,Ben,,,,,,
,136,Daniel Was Excellent  He Was Hosting The Bar And Was Friendly  Knowledgeable And Proffesional. He Is Definately An Assett To The Business.,,,,,,

,171,I Would Especially Like To Acknowledge Pete Saunders; Didier (I Don't Know His Surname) And The Waiter Who Was Serving Breakfast In The Morning.  The Receptionist (I Think It Was Dana) Too.  These Were The Staff We Had Most Contact With And Were Exceptional.  The Other Waiters/Waitresses Were Also Very Good But We Didn't Have As Much Contact With Them.,,,,,,
,174,All The Staff Were Excellent Apart From The Bar Man In The Gin Bar Who Didn't Seem Too Interested In Being At Work Or Offering Any Advice Or Recommendations In The World Renowned Gin Bar.  Very Disappointed In The Service Provided By This Individual.,,,,,,
,178,No,,,,,,

,189,All Very Good,,,,,,
,194,We Particularly Enjoyed The Young Man Who Went Through The Gins With Us (I'm Afraid I Didn't Note His Name)  Katie At Reception Was Very Polite And Friendly And The Lady That Served Us Breakfast Was Charming.,,,,,,
,198,Don't Know His Name But A Tall Waiter Was Very Chatty And Seemed To Be Very Knowledgeable Regarding The Menu And The Hotel Itself  He Seems To Be An Asset  Although All The Staff Were Very Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,,
,201,Everyone Was Very Friendly And Helpful.,,,,,,
,205,All Very Nice,,,,,,
,209,The Receptionist Was Excellent - Can't Remember Her Name (Would Have Been Monday 6Th),,,,,,
,212,All Staff Were Very Friendly  - Especially The Staff On Reception. We Did However Order A Newspaper And Didn't Receive It In The Morning Which Was Slightly Disappointing.,,,,,,

,229,We Participated In The Gin Experience And Would Like To Say That The Knowledge Of The Head Bar Man Was Exceptional. We Particularly Appreciated The Greeting Each Morning At Breakfast  With Your Staff Member Being Very Attentive And Remembering Us On The Second Morning. Unfortunately I Do Not Know His Name  But He Was Present Both Mornings And Tended To Greet All Residents.,,,,,,
,230,We Particularly Like The Waiter At Breakfast  As On Our Last Visit. Having Said That The Staff Are All Very Good. Do Not Have An Issue With The Slightly Unusual Practice Of Adding A Service Charge As The Service Merits It.,,,,,,

Also  We Arrived Early And Left Our Luggage With Reception While We Attended A Family Wedding.  When We Returned To Check-In  Your Staff Had Moved Our Luggage To Our Room And Had Even Hung Our Suit Bags In The Wardrobe - Excellent Service.,,,,,,
,247,All Were Really Super,,,,,,
,248,The Barman Was Very Knowledgeable About The Gin Stock  And Gave Us Some Good Advice.,,,,,,
,249,Not Sure Where To Add This But  I Ordered A Gin That I Wanted To Try  But Was Not Given A Choice Of Tonic  The Barman Chose My Tonic For Me  Ie He Didn't Offer Me A Choice He Just Poured One Before I Knew What He Was Doing. It Was Too Sweet For Me As I Drink Low Cal  Ie Fevertree Low And Didn't Enjoy My Â£11.45 Gin & Tonic As A Result! I Should Have Said At The Time But As I Said I Didn't Want To Cause A Fuss. I Think A Full Choice Should Be Offered   Guests May Have Odd Tastes But We Are The Paying Guests!,,,,,,

I Was Especially Thankful When My Brand New Â£500 Phone Was Returned To Our Room After I Absent Mindedly Left It On The Table In The Restaurant.  Peter Even Slipped It Under The Door After Calling To Inform Us It Had Been Found Rather Than Disturb Us.,,,,,,
,275,The Member Of Staff Serving At The Gin Bar On Sunday Afternoon. He Said That He Was Not The Normal Bartender But You Wouldn't Have Known As He Was Extremely Knowledgable And Gave Us Great Advice On Which Gins To Try.

,276,The Gentleman Serving Breakfast Was Very Friendly And Attentive.,,,,,,
,278,Ben Who Served In The Bar Was Very Friendly  Helpful And Informative In Helping Us Choose Which Gin To Taste. We Are Both Bank Managers And His Customer Service And Attention To Customer Needs Really Stood Out To Us Both,,,,,,

,759,The Bar Staff Were Friendly And Warm. There Was A Kindly Member Of The Waiting Staff. Reception Was Not As Attentive As They Could Be... Pre Occupied With The Computer/ Or Whatever.,,,,,,
,762,All Were Really Good,,,,,,
,766,The Member Of Staff On Arrival Was Fantastic  Very Welcoming And Informative. The Main Member Of Staff For The Evening Meal Was V Attentive And Friendly. The Waiter At Breakfast Was V Warm.,,,,,,

,772,Peter,,,,,,
,779,Pete Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,782,Restaurant Manager Was Attentive,,,,,,
,787,The Gentleman Running The Bar For The Reason Stated Before,,,,,,
,788,Everyone Was Really Polite And Courteous.  I Couldn't Fault Anyone.  It Wasn't A Stuffy Atmosphere Which Can Be The Case In Some Hotels.  I Liked The Fact That Everyone Smiled And Made Eye Contact.  I Didn't Recall Any Names But The Happy Chap At Breakfast [With The Slight Lisp] Was Most Welcoming In The Morning.  It Was Lovely To Be Greeted By His Cheerful Personality!,,,,,,
,791,Yes. The Receptionist Who Showed Us To Our Room. My Wife Now Struggles Slightly With Stairs. We Were Offered A Lower Room But Declined. It Was Thoughtful Though. Also The Very Nice Man Who Helped Us With Breakfast. Very Courteous. ,,,,,,
,794,The Gentleman Who Served Breakfast ,,,,,,
,796,No-One Specific ,,,,,,
,797,The Receptionist & Waiter In The Gin Bar  Very Friendly & Kind  Plus A Seemingly Instant Delivered Tea Tray After Phoning & Requesting Tea From The Reception! ,,,,,,
,798,The Table Staff For Breakfast Were Superb. Reception A Little Dizzy But Warm And Happy When We Got Settled  You Get That!,,,,,,
,800,Reception Ladies Were Lovely Both On Check In And Check Out,,,,,,
,801,The Service Was Excellent From Everybody.,,,,,,

,805,The Polish Barman Was A Guru When It Came To Gins. We Have Since Ordered Two New Gins He Introduce Us To.,,,,,,
,813,The Gentlemen At Breakfast And The Bar Man  Both Were Excellemt,,,,,,
,814,The Gentleman Who Welcomed Us To Breakfast Made Us Feel Very Special And Nothing Was Too Much For Him.,,,,,,

,838,The Gentleman Working Behind The Bar And Other Areas - I Do Like To Be Addressed By My Name So It Was Really Good That Time Was Taken To Find Out Who We Were And Remember It. He Was Very Attentive And Polite. Sorry Can't Remember His Name!,,,,,,

,857,Can't Remember His Name But Man In Charge Of Gin Bar,,,,,,
,858,The Ladies On The Front Desk Were Excellent. All Able And Courteous  If Not Slightly Overworked.,,,,,,
,863,The Bar Man Who Advised Us Re The Gins,,,,,,
,866,All Of The Staff Deserve A Mention,,,,,,
,868,Receptionist,,,,,,
,869,Always There With A Smile On Their Faces....Over Christmas Holidays!  We All Commented On How Kind And Caring Everyone Was  Very Attentive And They Took Such Good Care Of Us.,,,,,,
,871,All The Staff Were Extremely Pleasant Throughout Our Stay,,,,,,
,873,Receptionist  Helped In Repairing Lost Buttons,,,,,,
,876,The Chap On The Night Staff On Sunday Morning Around 1Am  Was Clearing Glasses  But Was Very Helpful And Asked If We Needed Anything. He Kept The Lights On For Us And Served Us A Drink Too. He Was Very Pleasant And Friendly And Hard Working!,,,,,,
,877,They Were All Splendid. ,,,,,,
,878,Richard Our Waiter,,,,,,
,882,Full Marks. ,,,,,,

,890,Peter Was A Great Host.,,,,,,
,891,Everyone Was Very Helpful.,,,,,,
,892,Unfortunately I Do Not Know His Name  But He Is Tall  Slim And Was Wearing A Shiny Grey Suit. He Attended To Our Every Demand  Including Going To Exceptional Lengths To Retrieve My Camera  Definitely Beyond The Call Of Duty. Please Pass On Our Sincere Thanks.,,,,,,
,893,The Gentleman (A Cheery Slim Man With Glasses)  That Seated Us In The Restaurant On Saturday Night And Breakfast On Monday Morning Was A Joy. ,,,,,,
,894,Ona On Reception As She Was Very Efficient But With Warmth. And Peter Especially. From Beginning To End Of Our Stay We Felt We Were In Safe Hands As Everything Was Monitored And Checked In A Professional And Subtle Manner.,,,,,,
,895,The Whole Team Was A Credit And We Were Well Looked After - Thank You.,,,,,,
,899,All Staff Were Excellent,,,,,,
,901,The Head Waiter Who Remembered Our Name From One Evening To The Next.,,,,,,
,904,Agree But Wasn't Made To Feel Special,,,,,,

,907,Reception Team Very Welcoming And Helpful,,,,,,

,929,All Helpfull.,,,,,,
,930,All Of The Staff We Encountered Were Equally Polite And Courteous And Welcoming  Apart From The Food. This Is One Of The Reasons Why We Will Be Definately Revisiting The Feathers. Thank You. ,,,,,,
,932,Anna On Reception Was Extremely Helpful But All The Staff Were Pleasant.  ,,,,,,
,938,The Local Guy Who Was Training In The Gin Bar  He Was With You After His University Degree Was Great And The Guy On Reception Who Took Our Bags Up  Brought Us Tea And Helped Us With A Bathroom Leak Was Really Helpful And Friendly  So Important With Staff.,,,,,,
,940,Restaurant Manager On The Valentines Night Dinner Who Recommended The Wine. He Was Very Tall,,,,,,
,943,Anna Was Particularly Helpful And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble For Her.,,,,,,
,944,No You Really Have A Great Team Of Staff And Fantastic Chefs Of Course!,,,,,,
,946,The Barman In The Gin Bar,,,,,,
,947,No,,,,,,
,949,The Lovely Ladies Who Do The Cleaning - The Room Was Spotless,,,,,,
,951,Fraser And Dana Were Particularly Helpful But All The Team Were Brilliant,,,,,,
,952,The Manager Of The Gin Bar Was Excellent (Sorry Don't Know His Name).  But Before He Appeared We Were Left A Little Adrift.  We Wanted To Have A Gin Based Cocktail But The List On The Table Was For Anything But Gin.  When The Waiter Asked Us What We Wanted We Really Didn't Know Specifically But We Hoped He Would Suggest Something.  Instead He Just Gave Us The Book That You Keep Behind The Bar.  When The Manager Arrived He Was Able To Help Us Though.,,,,,,
,957,The Waiters In The Restaurant Were Extremely Pleasant And Friendly,,,,,,
,962,They Were All Most Attentive And Helpful.,,,,,,
,963,I Refer To My Comments Above,,,,,,
,965,Everyone Was Equally Happy And Helpful.,,,,,,
,966,The Staff At The Front Desk Were Excellent ,,,,,,
,968,Lady On Reception. Sadly Don't Remember Name. Wore A Grey Suit.  Very Helpful And Friendly,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,,
,2,There Was A Small Error On The Bill On Checkout But This Was Rectified Promptly And Did Not Detract Form Our Overall Experience.,,,,,,
,4,None,,,,,,
,7,A Petty Comment But The Fire In The Reception Area Was Very Smoky And Smelly And  Filled Both The Reception And Sitting Area Behind With An Unpleasant Air- We Didnt Use The Sitting Area As A Consequence,,,,,,
,10,Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.,,,,,,
,18,Again Temperature Was The Problem - Understandable Due To Weather In Most Aspects Except That Money Was Paid For A 'Restful'  Night,,,,,,
,24,Bathroom Products Were Not Up To The Hotel I Thought,,,,,,
,25,We Were Disappointed With The Standard Of The Room We Were Allocated Given The Beautiful Pictures We Had Seen On The Internet.  The Study Was Very Small And We Struggled During The Day To Get A Seat For The 3 Of Us As People From The Public Were There Having Meetings Both Days Of Our Stay.  The Sofa In The Corridor Offered Alternative Seating But Was Opposite The Toilets So We Decided To Give It A Miss And Just Went Back To Our Room.  Our Room Was Clean But I Did Notice Cobwebs On The Ceiling.  It Would Be Good To Get Rid Of Those For Next Guests.  Overall We Had A Good Time.  The Staff Were Brilliant With The Exception Of That One Guy.  I'm Sorry I Did Not Get His Name.,,,,,,
,27,We Had Dinner As Part Of Our Package But Was Charged Another Â£10 For A Coffee And Tea At The End Of Our Meal.  We Thought This Would Be Either Served As Part Of The Meal Or If We Had Ordered It In Our Room  This Would Be Complimentary.,,,,,,
,31,The Breakfast Experience Described Above  And Which Coloured Our Overall Opinion.,,,,,,
,36,Cleaned The Toilet Properly And Had Happier More Friendly Wait Staff,,,,,,
,40,Not To Run Out Of Cooked Breakfast Items By 8.45 Am,,,,,,
,42,Make The Jam-Pots Less Sticky?  :-),,,,,,
,44,I Just Thought The Hotel Was Going To Be More Luxurious. Then Again The Other Rooms That Weren't Meant For Disabled People May Have Been More Luxurious.  As We Have No Disabilities The Room Was Not To Our Needs.,,,,,,
,49,Better Staff Training Ie Dirty Plates Left On Table When Serving Next Course Especially At Breakfast,,,,,,
,50,The Staff Need Better Training In The Restaurant.,,,,,,
,51,The Staff Level Either Need Increasing Or A Manager Needs To Be Around To Organise The Staff Better.,,,,,,
,52,Service Was Very Slow.,,,,,,
,54,No,,,,,,
,57,When We Were Checking Out We Wanted To Spend About Half An Hour In The Lounge And Were Advised That It Was Booked Out For A Private Function So We Sat In The Bar. We Passed The Lounge As We Left And It Was Not Occupied By Anyone. The Final Impression Was A Little Diminished By This.  Also  My Mother Is Becoming Less Able And I Didn't Realise That The Stairs Were So Steep In The Building So I Wouldn't Use The Hotel If I Was Visiting With Someone With Restrictions In Their Mobility. That Is Not The Fault Of The Hotel But May Be Worth Pointing Out To Customers When They Book.,,,,,,
,63,Please Can You Improve Your Bedrooms  I Have Many Friends Who Have Given Up On 'The Feathers' And Regularly Stay At Another Hotel In Woostock. Please Can Afternoon Tea Be Improved  Clotted Cream Which Had Gone Off And No Cakes Just Pieces Of Bread Or Biscuit  Very Strange.,,,,,,
,68,Nothing Really Comes To Mind!,,,,,,
,69,As Mentioned In Previous Notes  The Only Disappointing Thing Was That The Waiting Staff Seemed A Bit Oblivious As Menu Changes  Etc. At Breakfast We Asked For Fresh Fruit Salad (Which Should Have Been With The Buffet Items) And At First We Were Told 'We Usually Have It So Not Sure Why There Isn't Any'. A Senior Staff Member Then Made Sure That Some Was Made But The Initial Response Was Not Very Good. Also  Although The Cooked Breakfast Was Excellent The Toast Was Brought To Us While We Were Still Eating Cereals And Therefore Ended Up Being Stone Cold By The Time We Ate It.,,,,,,
,70,I Think You Have A Lovely Hotel  In A Great Location  But I Think That For The Price You Want To Charge For The Style Of Room We Stayed In Sets People's Expectations Far Too High  So Hence We Were Disappointed When We Came To Pay The Bill - And Whilst The Evening Meal Was Lovely  Charging Â£9.50 For 2 Filter Coffees (Especially When There Is No Facility For Making Your Own In The Room) Is Too High. And Although The Staff Were Not Rude At All  They Didn't Appear Happy In Their Work Either!,,,,,,
,76,Breakfast Situation  Being Honest About The Air Con Unit Bedroom  Improving The Wifi In All Parts Of The Hotel And Staffing The Bar 100% Of The Time.,,,,,,
,80,No  It Was Fine,,,,,,
,81,Feathers Was Renowned For Good Food And In Previous Visits It Lived Up To It. This Visit Came As A Surprise. Tasting Menu Extremely Mediocre....At Least 2 Of The Dishes Were On A Bed Of Spinach...Original! Breakfast No Fruit Juice On Display. Asked For A Mixed Brown And White Toast And Got All White. No Butter . Even I Can Do Fried Eggs Without Burning Them.,,,,,,
,82,Already Covered Most Aspects But Felt Overall Service Could Have Been More Professional.,,,,,,
,85,No,,,,,,
,86,Employ More Staff!,,,,,,
,88,We Enjoyed Our Stay With You And We Will Return  Your Hotel And Woodstock Is Charming But Would Really Like To See A More Varied Menu And Hopefully Better Internet Reception.,,,,,,
,89,Apart From Offering A Slightly Larger Menu (Just A Bit Limited If You're Staying 2/3 Days Or More) We Had A Very Pleasant Stay.  We Will Certainly Return As Your Hotel And Woodstock Is Charming.,,,,,,
,93,The Only Thing We Were Less Than Impressed With Was The Bar  As There Is Very Little Atmosphere In There.  We Had A Drink In There When We Returned From Blenheim In The Afternoon  But It Did Not Inspire Us To Return There Before Dinner  So We Went Next Door To The Woodstock Arms!,,,,,,
,96,During The Morning Most Of The Corridors Were  Full Of Obstacles Such As Linen Bags  Bottles For Bottling Up The Bar. We Had To Move Some Of These To Get Our Suitcases Down The Stairs. During Breakfast The Breakfast Room Was Reconstructed To Set Upna Long Table  Presumably For A Lunch Meeting/Party. I Felt Like I Was In A Building Site,,,,,,
,102,There Was Nothing Outstanding In My Experience Considering The Cost Which Was Rather High. I Was Particularly Upset With The Breakfast When One Of My Group(Six Friends Having A Reunion) Found That As She Had Ordered Porridge She Could Not Have Any Other Additional Hot Food Without Paying Extra. This Seemed Extraordinary And I Have Never Come Across Such Pettiness In A Hotel Of Your Reputation. I Had Done The Booking And I Felt Responsible For The Well-Being Of The Party And Was Let Down By Such A Policy.,,,,,,
,104,Those Who Opt For Porridge Might Do So For Healthy Reasons  So Maybe The Cream Should Be Optional? Only A Small Thing.,,,,,,
,106,As We Were Downgraded To A Lower Standard Room Because Of The Noise  It Would Have Been Nice To Have Had Some Recognition Of That Fact.  After Stating How We Felt On Check-Out The Â£5 Dinner Supplement Was Removed From The Bill - Big Deal!,,,,,,
,109,Only Wish The Internet Was Better And In The Room,,,,,,
,111,I Would Have Liked To Have Been Able To Upgrade To A Suite,,,,,,
,113,Lighter Early Evening Meal Choices For People With Dietary Issues.(I Canot Eat A Full Meal Afte 6Pm But My Choice Of 'Lite Bites' Was Rather Limited.),,,,,,
,114,Better Food At Dunner,,,,,,
,122,We Had A Lovely Stay But There Were Some Quirks Which Were About The Low Level Of Attention To Detail Which Is Expected For The Prices You Are Charging.  For Example We Decided To Have A Gin When Returning To The Hotel Before Getting Ready For Dinner (It Was About 5Pm) And We Were Sitting In The Study Area  Happy To Go To The Bar To Order But We Then Had To Carry The Glasses And Bottles To Our Table  Rather Than Them Being Served. ,,,,,,
,126,1St Breakfast In Room (Toast Only And Small Quantity) No Cups Or Spoons And Tea Cold By The Time It Arrived 2Nd Day Had To Chase For Breakfast Twice And Waited For Over An Hour.,,,,,,
,137,My Only Commnet Is That I Find The Dinner Menu Rather Expensive For My Requirements  But Acknowledge That This Is Only A Personal View. Otherwise I Make This A Regular Stay.,,,,,,
,139,We Are Both In Our 60'S And Were Staying On The Second Floor Up Some Narrow Stairs - So Someone To Take Our Luggage To The Room Would Have Been Good.,,,,,,
,140,We Waited For Ages In Bar To Get Served  Nobody Around - About 10Pm,,,,,,
,143,Rectify The Noise Element In Room 14.  Inform Guests Making The Booking About Rooms Available.,,,,,,
,144,Please Improve Service And Food Consistency At Breakfast,,,,,,
,146,Only Real Problem Was The Heating - Very Very Hot And The Plumbing Is Also Very Noisy.,,,,,,
,147,We Were Only Staying One Night But Didn't Really See Many Members Of Staff. The Decor Is Lovely But It Was A Cold Wet Evening And It Would Have Been Lovely If The Fire Had Been On In The Reception Area And A Member Of Staff Had Been There To Welcome Us.,,,,,,
,149,Parking Was A Bit Of An Issue When We Arrived But I Appreciate There Is Little You Can Do About That!,,,,,,
,150,Breakfast Wasn't That Great. I Had Eggs Benedict & The Bread Used Was Very Strange!,,,,,,
,151,See Above,,,,,,
,155,Nothing,,,,,,
,156,Overall Excellent. Only Two Observations Would Be  As Previously Mentioned  There Should Be Tea / Coffee Facilities In The Room And The Service At Breakfast Was Very Slow.,,,,,,
,161,It Will Be Great When Wi-Fi Is Available Throughout The Hotel,,,,,,
,164,Better Food And Service,,,,,,
,171,No,,,,,,
,178,Nono,,,,,,
,179,Carry On With This Excellent Customer Service It Made A Refreshing Change,,,,,,
,181,Shutters On The Windows Would Have Been Great!,,,,,,
,183,Just Down Pillows!,,,,,,
,184,Breakfast Service Was Very Slow And Â£8 For A Couple Of Coffees In The Bar Seemed A Little Steep But Overall A Pleasant Stay.,,,,,,
,186,Not Sure We Particularly Like The Automatic Service Charge Added To Restaurant Charge. Customers Should Be Trusted To Leave An Appropriate Tip.,,,,,,
,187,We Would Have Preferred To Sleep-In But We Were Woken Up Before 7Am With A Pot Of Tea - Room Service Which We Did Not Order.  My Husband Was Expecting The Breakfast To Meet The Exceptional Standard He Had Experienced On His Previous Stay But This Time Was A Little Disappointed.,,,,,,
,188,Each Time We Were In The Bar Lounge Areas I Had To Go And Look For A Member Of Staff To Serve Us. When They Came  It Was Good Service  But I Think That The Service Is More Responsive To Request Rather Than Naturally Good And Pre-Emptive Of The Customers Needs.,,,,,,
,189,No,,,,,,
,192,We Paid Â£159 For One Night Dinner Bed And Breakfast On A Special Offer. This Represented Reasonable Value In Our Opinion But The Experience Was Not One That We Would Repeat. We Have Eaten And Stayed At Hotels Of Similar And Higher Quality And Had Much Better Food And Accomodation For The Same Or Less Cost.,,,,,,
,193,Improve Service On Breakfast A Bit And Make Sure The Bill Is Accurate On The Way Out!  It Took The Receptionist Three Attempts To Get Ours Right!,,,,,,
,199,Better Service At Breakfast. Apologies At Check Out For The Inconvenience Of Lack Of Water In Suite 1 Rather Than A Comment About A Power Cut ( Which Was Not The Case).,,,,,,
,202,It Was A Really Nice Experience - Don't Get Me Wrong. But We Had Hoped For Something More Particular. Woodstock Is One Of My Very  Very Favourite Places And I Wanted To Share It. We Chose You Of The Great Alternatives Because The Idea Of A Crazy 'Guinness Book Of Records' Gin Bar Was Fabulous. We Wanted To Relax  Sit There  Chat With A Bar Man. Get Him To Talk Us Through Some Flavours And Experiment  Then Have A Great Meal. But It Felt Less Bar Plus Restaurant Than A General Bistro/Restaurant Experience. Oddly  The Style Of Your Study Would Make A Better Start For Your Bar.,,,,,,
,213,Service In The Bar  End Of Dinner And At Breakfast Where We Had To Ask If We Could Sit Anywhere  Had To Ask For Toast And Were Not Offered Any Condiments.,,,,,,
,215,No,,,,,,
,217,The Food At Breakfast On Both Mornings Was Very Good. The Service On The Sunday Morning Was Very Poor - No One Seemed To In Charge We Had To Ask Twice For Water We Asked For More Toast Towards The End But None Arrived. Staff Never Looked At The Table To See If Anything Needed Replacing - Usually When You Ask For More Toast You Will Require More Butter! The Service On The Monday Morning At Breakfast Was Excellent - The Young Man/Manager Was Really On The Ball.,,,,,,
,219,Free Wireless Internet In The Room,,,,,,
,222,We Would Have Appreciated Tea Making Facilities. Our Room Was Really Too Hot Even Though We Had A Fan.,,,,,,
,226,Breakfast In Bed? /Jk,,,,,,
,228,Issue With Noise From A Late Running Party Below. Gin Bar Service Was Poor As My Girlfriend Was Ignored At The Bar. Other Than This The Service Was Fantastic.,,,,,,
,230,No,,,,,,
,232,Tea Making Facilities In The Room Would Have Been Lovely Because I Woke In The Early Hours And Could Have Done With A Kettle.,,,,,,
,233,No,,,,,,
,235,I Was Disappointed With Your Wifi That Was More Or Less Non Existent Throughout Our Stay  Although I Was Led To Believe That This And Mobile Phone Reception Was A Common Problem In The Woodstock Area.,,,,,,
,242,It Would Have Been Helpful To Receive E-Mail Confirmation Of My Booking Promptly  Instead Of Only At The Second Request.,,,,,,
,244,Just A Small Point: We Were Offered Tea In Our Room On Check-In.  I Was Unsure Whether This Was Complimentary And Didn't Like To Ask.  Perhaps Your Staff Could Make It Clear Whether Or Not The Tea Offered Is Complimentary To Avoid Embarassment Or Confusion For Guests.,,,,,,
,248,Please Put A Bin In The Garden Area.,,,,,,
,249,We Had Coffee But Didn't Get Petitfour  As Other Guests Did.,,,,,,
,253,I Think I Have Covered The Areas That We Were Not Happy With,,,,,,
,257,Wifi As Previously Mentioned.,,,,,,
,259,Stop The Snow So We Could Have Gone To Belhaim Palace!!!!,,,,,,
,263,Have Your Own Car Park Or Provide More Information To Assist Guests E.G. That 2 & 3 Hrs Parking Restrictions Can Be Ignored.  It Was Impossible To Park In Woodstock At Some Times On Sat 3Rd Aug.,,,,,,
,268,Not That I Can Think Of!,,,,,,
,270,The Final Bill Was Confusing Because We Never Knew For Sure What The Package Comprised.  We Were Surprised By The Service Charge 10% Of The Total Cost Of The Stay - This We Should Have Queried And At Least Checked That The Staff Actually Receive The Full Amount Taken - If Not  We Would Not Have Paid.  Th Staff Certainly Earn The Amount We Paid,,,,,,
,276,Much Better Dining Experience  Although Breakfast Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,277,Our Stay With You Was On Special Offer So We Felt It Was Very Good Value  However If We Had Been Paying The Normal Price We Feel It May Not Have Been As The Restaurant Does Not Live Up To Its Recommendations.  Also The Coffee Served In The Gin Bar Is Very Poor.,,,,,,
,278,Upgrade To Suites If There Were Not Used.,,,,,,
,281,Breakfast Was Not As Good As When We Visited In The Past  And Conducting An Interview In The Lounge When Guests Are Present Is Very Poor.,,,,,,
,286,Just A Little More Attention To Detail In The Restaurant.,,,,,,
,288,I Have Stayed In Much More Comfortable Rooms In Many Levels Of Hotel,,,,,,
,291,Not Really. But As Already Mentioned  Breakfast Service Was Not Up To The Rest Of The Hotel's High Standard,,,,,,
,296,The Room Was Lovely But Wasn't Expecting Not  To Be In The Main Hotel. The Food Exceeded Our Expectations.,,,,,,
,297,We Thought We Would Miss Tea Tray In Room But As It Was Only For One Night And We Had A Complimentary Tea In The Morning We Survived. At The Lords Of The Manor Where We Stay Often We Have Been Able To Request A Tray In Our Room.,,,,,,
,302,Had A Nicer Room!  Shown A Picture Of Your Dog Friendly Room On Your Web Site.  Unfortunately It Is Difficult For Us To Go Away Without Our Dog But We Are Obviously Still Choosy And Like Nice Rooms.  We Have Stayed In Some Lovely Ones Even With Henry So I Suppose It Is Expectations.,,,,,,
,305,Honestly  No.,,,,,,
,310,Slightly Wider Choice On The Menu For Dinner And More Food At The Breakfast Buffet.,,,,,,
,312,Shame The Gin Experience Wasn't Possible As Hadn't Booked.  Did Enjoy 4 Different Gins Between Us Though!,,,,,,
,315,A Bowl Of Muesli Was Missed Off Our Breakfast Order  We Rang Down To Infrom Reception And It Took Quite A While And A Further Phone Call Before It Arrived Meaning The Rest Of The Breakfast Had Gone Cold.  Also  The Room (Hawk Suite) Was A Bit Noisy In The Morning As The Door Opens Straight Out On To The Corrider.  A Lot Of The Noise I Think Was From Staff Having Conversations In The Hall At The Bottom Of The Stairs.,,,,,,
,316,The Parking Issue,,,,,,
,318,No,,,,,,
,320,Room Was Small But Well Appointed - No Complaints Here.  Dining Experience Could Have Been Much Better And That Coloured The Whole Experience Of Our Stay.  Would Be Happy To Stay At The Feathers Again But Are More Likely To Choose Another Hotel.,,,,,,
,326,Pre Dinner Drinks Arriving Pre Dinner. Two Of The Lovely Comfortable Armchairs In The Bedroom,,,,,,
,328,Noty That I Can Think Of - It Was Perfect,,,,,,
,329,Apart From Missold Information About The Evening Five Course Meal Which Sold On Pretext On Â£55 Not Â£45 As Stated On Day And As Already Purchased At Higher Price Left Me Feeling Dissatisfied  But Staff Friendly Room Lovely And Hotel Very Good.,,,,,,
,330,There Were Not Any Tea And Coffee Facilities In The Room  Which We Thought Was A Little Strange!  Swap The Jelly Beans For Chocolates?,,,,,,
,333,Not At All.,,,,,,
,335,No,,,,,,
,338,Improve Room 42  Sort Out The Parking  Provide Higher Quality Pillows And Duvet.,,,,,,
,340,Nothing I Can Think Of.  We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome.,,,,,,
,341,A Clean Room Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,,
,342,More Moisturiser Inroom,,,,,,
,343,More Moisturiser,,,,,,
,344,A Different Room Above Street Level! A Working Remote Control!,,,,,,
,345,Maybe Take The French Toast Off Your Breakfast Menu Or Add Sugar And Cinnamon To It (!?) - It Wasn't Quite What I Expected When It Arrived  I'm Not Sure It Would Have Been What Most People I Know Would Have Called French Toast.  It Was Well Presented And Well Made Though.,,,,,,
,347,Just The Heating In The Room.,,,,,,
,348,The Food At Dinner Let Us Down As Previously Mentioned But Otherwise Good,,,,,,
,349,Not Eeally,,,,,,
,357,To Keep Us Informed Of Any Ongoing Delays/Situations In The Service Area.,,,,,,
,360,Perhaps I Should Have Asked If It Was Possible To Change Our Room !  This Rather Coloured Our Opinion.,,,,,,
,361,We Were Not Informed Of Price Of Drinks As Went Along And Thought That Â£12 Was Rather A Lot For A Gin And Tonic,,,,,,
,362,The Room Was Extremely Noisy.  There Were Drinkers Outside The Pub Until 1Am And The Traffic Started To Roar Past At 6Am.  It Was Like Being In A Motorway Motel.,,,,,,
,364,Pressing,,,,,,
,366,The Bill Was Overcharged By Over Fifty Pounds? The Breakfast Was Good  But Coffee Needed Work. I Would Also Assume That A Full English Breakfast Included Toast!?,,,,,,
,371,No. Everything Was Lovely As Expected,,,,,,
,374,Have More Information About The History Of The Building.,,,,,,
,375,Final Account Was Wrong But Was Recified,,,,,,
,376,Mention Special Rates On Reservation  Considering Voucher Money In Your Account Since Last Aug 2012.,,,,,,
,377,Just A Better Room,,,,,,
,379,We Thought The Dinners Were Good But Certainly Not Exceptional.  We Would Have Liked Baked Beans With Breakfast.,,,,,,
,380,Staff Training Was The Issue With Dinner,,,,,,
,386,Yes - The Restaurant Dinner Menu Needs Simpler Choices And More Affordable Options (The Kings Arms Accross The Street Is A Better Option In My View),,,,,,
,394,Cold Night  Dining Room Could Have Been Warmer But Accept I Had A Silk Dress On !,,,,,,
,397,Provision For Earlier Breakfast As The Fair Starts Set Up At 7:30A.M I Was Unable To Have Breakfast On The Saturday,,,,,,
,400,A Bit Disappointed That Your Outside Smoking Shelter Was Not Heated As It Was A Very Cold Night And I Usually Enjoy A Cigar With Brandy After Dinner This Is Quite Common In London Scotts Etc.,,,,,,
,401,More Staff For Breakfast. Service And Food Was Slow,,,,,,
,403,Room  Hotel Itself And Food Were Very Good. Service Overall Was Disappointing.,,,,,,
,405,No,,,,,,
,407,Being Clearer About The Exclusion Of Vat In Advertised Prices.,,,,,,
,414,At Checkout Time  One Member Of Staff Was Checking People Out And Answering The Phone At The Same Time. I Waited About 15 Mins To Check Out.,,,,,,
,415,Training Amongst The Staff Who Appear To Be New. Redecoration Of The Restaurant  Particularly The Carpet.,,,,,,
,418,About 15 Minutes After We Left The Hotel We Discovered We Had Left A Mobile Phone On The Premises.  We Rang The Hotel Several Times But No One Answered  Re-Confirming Our Observation That The Hotel Is A Bit Under-Staffed.  When We Arrived Back We Searched For The Phone Ourselves And Found It In The Study.,,,,,,
,420,No  As A 10Th Anniversary It Was Great.,,,,,,
,425,Better Wi- Fi Access Necessary.,,,,,,
,426,Let Us Visit First.,,,,,,
,428,Been Given A Different Room.  I Wondered If We'd Been Given That Room Because We Were Using Secret Escapes.  The Hotel Wasnt Full When We Checked In Because Someone Came In While We Were Having Tea And Asked If They Could Book In Without A Reservation.  Acknowledgement Would Have Been Good - 40 Minutes Of Sitting In Study Before Being Asked If We Wanted Refreshments Depsite At Least 3 Staff Walking Past And Serving Others. Apology For Lack Of Tables For Breakfast / Tables Being Cleared Etc (Both Mornings) Maybe.  Any Interest At All Would Have Been Good.  Seriously Poor.,,,,,,
,430,Recommended 8 Pm Dining Not 830Pm As We Felt Too Late Towards The End Of Our Supper - Other Guest Left!,,,,,,
,441,No  I Don't Think So.....,,,,,,
,442,Personally  Being A Light Sleeper  To Have Tea / Coffee In Room Facilities Would Have Been A Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,443,By The Way - My Bill Was Not Correct On Leaving. You Had Added The Dinner On Top Of My Package But The Young Guy On Reception Apologised. It Just Tainted The Experience Really As It Showed A Lack Of Care / Communication.,,,,,,
,444,You Do Not Provide Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.  Fair Enough But You Must Make Sure That You Provide Them Promptly By Room Service When Asked - Waiting Over 25 Minutes For A Cup Of Tea (And Having To Phone To Remind You) Is Not Acceptable.,,,,,,
,445,More Than One Bar Of Soap - We Could Have Done With One For The Shower And One For The Hand Basin - A Small Point Though!!,,,,,,
,447,Maybe Gather Diners In In Closer Proximity When Not Many Bookings To Increase Buzz.,,,,,,
,450,I Really Would Have Liked A Kettle In The Room! I Understand Why You Don't Have Them And Tea Was Offered (But It Wasn't Clear Whether There Would Be A Charge And At The Prices Of All The Other Drinks That Would Have Made A Big Difference),,,,,,
,453,Tea/Coffee Making Facilities In Room; Making A Section Of The Bar Available To Guests Who Weren't Part Of The Wedding Party,,,,,,
,459,The Restaurant Experience Could Have Been A Lot Better And Is One Of The Worst I Have Had Ever Had As In The Head Waiter Didn't Smile Or Connect With Us Once.,,,,,,
,464,Speed Of Service. I Wouldn't Have Any Concern About Bringing A Smaller Party But Would Seriously Consider Before Bringing A Larger Partry Again.,,,,,,
,466,As Previously Mentioned  A Change Of Menu On The Second Night.,,,,,,
,467,We Did Enjoy Our Stay My Comments Are Things I Think You Can Easily Fix As I M Sure You Know These Small Things Make A Difference. Even On A Sunday Night.,,,,,,
,474,Better Wifi :),,,,,,
,475,The Breakfast Eggs Were Too Salty For All Our Tastes And We Found Them Inedible,,,,,,
,477,Your Staff Need To Get Lessons From Sven And Emily In Customer Services,,,,,,
,478,No,,,,,,
,481,Breakfast Needs Same Attention To Detail As The Main Dinner Service.,,,,,,
,487,We Anticipated The Room To Be Of A Higher Standard. Bath Plug Did Not Function Neither Did Telephone. Room Was Not Superior In Our Estimation But Nevertheless We Enjoyed Our Stay.,,,,,,
,488,Just Sharpen Up The Service At Dinner  I Think.,,,,,,
,493,No!!,,,,,,
,496,I Think My Restaurant Review Clearly States Where The Problems Arise,,,,,,
,500,Tea/Coffee Making Facilities  In The Room Would Have Been Nice.3 Drinks On Bill Which We Did Not Have But No Problem Once We Pointed It Out.,,,,,,
,501,It Was Only The Dining Which Spoilt Our Visit.    Other Than That We Thought The Feathers Was A Very Pleasant Hotel To Visit.,,,,,,
,506,Not From A Level Of Service No.,,,,,,
,512,See Previous Notes.,,,,,,
,516,The Fact That There Was A Problem In The Kitchen Was Handled Well My Fault I Chose To Eat At The Indian. Breakfast Was Terrible Bacon Like Shoe Leather Egg Overdone It Said Mushrooms On The Menu We Had Half A Mushroom Each,,,,,,
,518,No  Really Enjoyed Our Stay,,,,,,
,522,We Were Charged For Tickets Which Were Not Given To Us. We Ere Not Inforemd Of The Need To Reserve Dinner For Sat Night Well In Advance.,,,,,,
,524,I Feel Although The Website Is Very Enthusiastic About 'The Gin Experience'   When We Went To The Bar It Seemed Very Difficult To Actually Order A Drink. Staff Weren't Often There And When We Enquired About Selection Of  Gin Cocktails As Mentioned On The Website We Were Almost Discouraged. It Would Have Been Nice To Have Been Offered A Drinks Menu.,,,,,,
,526,Only The Addition Of Tea And Coffee Making Equipment  As Previously Mentioned.,,,,,,
,532,I Think A Really Big Problem For Us Was That There Were No Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room  I Know That We Could Ring Room Service And Get One Any Time However I Am A Very Early Riser And Was Dying For A Cuppa At 6.00 And Had To Wait Till Seven  I Know It Seems Small However Felt Like I Was Sitting Around Waiting,,,,,,
,543,Grapefruit Juice With Breakfast?,,,,,,
,549,No  We Had A Fantastic Stay And My Husband Thoroughly Enjoyed His Birthday Treat. We Shall Return!,,,,,,
,551,One Member Of The Party Was Ill And I Had To Cancel Early On The Day Of Arrival. I Accept And Understand That The Balance Had To Be Paid But Perhaps Given The Circumstances And The Fact That The Meal And Drinks Were Not Being Consumed For 8 People Only 7  This  Proportion Of The Cost Could Have Been Used To Provide Some Complimentary Drinks?,,,,,,
,553,No It Was Lovely.,,,,,,
,557,We Like Our Own Tea And Coffee In The Room  We Do Not Like Having Morning Tea Fetched To The Room.,,,,,,
,558,The Overall Stay Was Really Good And The Sun Shone For Us.  The Staff Were Helpful But Some Of The English Was Not Good.,,,,,,
,560,We Had To Wait About 10 Minutes To Be Served At The Gin Bar When We Returned From Our Evening Out. Noone Was At The Bar And We Had To Ask For Assistance At Reception Which We Thought Unacceptable In A Hotel Of Your Repute.,,,,,,
,561,No,,,,,,
,567,Removed The Previous Guests Soiled Clothing Before We Arrived In The Room.,,,,,,
,572,The Inacuracies With The Bill Were Disappointing And Hard To Follow With The Way The Bill Had Been Itemised For The Food Given We Had Agreed A Package Price. Some Items Were Charged Which We Had Not Consumed.,,,,,,
,576,We Received A Bottle Of Sloe Gin And Were Expecting A Bottle Of Hendricks.,,,,,,
,578,Breakfast Being Improved And The Bill Being Correct!,,,,,,
,582,I Did Not Appreciate The Service Charge Added To The Bill - Never Seen That At A Hotel Before And It Is An Unwelcome Innovation.,,,,,,
,585,Aforementioned Tea Making Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,588,The Breakfast Included In The B&B Rate Was A Little Sparse  But Of High Quality.,,,,,,
,595,Increase Your Staffing Levels.,,,,,,
,601,We Were In Room 25 Immediately Above Reception And Were Woken Soon After 6Am On Saturday Morning By Loud Voices Coming From Reception.  After About 10 Minutes Of Listening To This I Went Downstairs In My Dressing Gown To Complain  The Two Gentlemen Were Very Apologetic And It Was Peaceful After That.  It Was The Only Problem We Encountered During Our Stay.,,,,,,
,607,Stop Adding 'Discretionary' Service Charges To The Bill. If Guests Feel It Appropriate To Give An Additional Reward To Staff They Should Be Left To Make That Decision Themselves.,,,,,,
,613,No  Just The Heat In The Bedroom/Noise/Air Conditioning,,,,,,
,619,No,,,,,,
,621,No But I Am Not Sure Dining Experience This Time Quite Achieved. Offering Another Roll Rather Than Having To Ask... Slightly Bigger Portions Also Would Have Made Superb. Good Service,,,,,,
,623,Have Internet In The Rooms (Free),,,,,,
,629,We Felt That The Restaurant Was Overpriced.,,,,,,
,631,I Was Not Informed That The Restaurant Was Booked Out For A Function And Hence Could Not Eat There In The Evening. Hence I Did Not Even Think About Breakfast.,,,,,,
,633,A Little Disappointed In The Gin Bar  No Menu And The Barman Was Not That Engaged When Asked For Recommendations. Bit Puzzled As This Is One Of Your Key Items With So Many Gins.  Otherwise An Excellent Stay.,,,,,,
,635,No We Had A Lovely Stay.,,,,,,
,636,Get Back To A Level The Level Of Service And Excellent Food That You Used To Offer-As Recently As Our Previous Visit In February-Big Changes Have Occurred Since Then And The Feathers Is A Shadow Of It's Former Self.,,,,,,
,639,Your Staff Were Very Friendly And Hepful But Insome Cases Not Very Well Trained. Ordered A Cocktail  When It Came It Was Missing One Of The Ingredients.   When Raised The Matter We Wee Told They Had Run Out Of Peach Sauce  But Didnt Tell Us Up Front.,,,,,,
,651,No  Very Pleased Overall And Superb Value For Money.,,,,,,
,652,More Attentive In The Restaurant And Study,,,,,,
,654,Yes   If Someone Ask's If You Have A Disable Space   I Would Have Thought It Was Not A Good Idea To Put On The Third Floor With Stairs With No Handrail,,,,,,
,655,In The Restaurant One Of The Seats Facing The Window Means The Light From The Opposing Building Shiones In The Diners Eyes.,,,,,,
,656,Cleanliness Of Room Needs Addressing As Not Only Was Bedding Not Up To Standard But Towel Rail Was Dusty And Towels Were Not As Clean As Expected. Cannot Fault Staff During Our Stay Who Were Very Helpful,,,,,,
,668,Overall  The Hotel Is Very Nice. I Don't Think It Deserves The High Prices Demanded Of Everything Though. It Is Impossible To Sleep Well In Suite 1 Because Of The Floor Creaking And Having No Sleep Really Gives You A Bad Impression Of The Place. Staff Generally Very Nice.   ,,,,,,
,669,Overall A Good Experience But Sort The Main Courses At Dinner,,,,,,
,670,Fixed The Draught In The Bathroom!,,,,,,
,673,The Reception Staff  Though Extremely Helpful And Kind  Seemed Very Rushed Most Of The Time. There Could Be One Or Two More Staff There  If Possible. Even One More  As A Back Up  Would Be Good.,,,,,,
,675,Tea/ Coffee Making Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,677,Direction Of Staff,,,,,,
,680,Some Of Your Waiting Staff Seem Uncertain As To How To Serve Scones And Tea - I.E Not Sure How Many Scones There Will Be - Did Not Bring Plates To Put Them On - Did Not Bring Knives To Cut Them With And To Spread Cream And Jam,,,,,,
,683,The Wood Fires Are Lovely  But There Seems To Be A Great Deal Of Smoke In The Lounge Rooms. Are The Chimneys Working Correctly? It Made Me Cough Quite A Bit.,,,,,,
,684,Charged For A Bottle Of Wine We Did Not Have,,,,,,
,686,The Sommelier Could Have Been A Little More Informative.  We Love Wine And Would Have Liked To Talk More About The List And Go With Recommendations From The Sommelier. However  We Chose Some Really Good Wine And Were Happy With It.,,,,,,
,690,On Arrival Give A Quick Heads Up As To Where All The Facilities Are.,,,,,,
,703,Coffee And Biscuits In The Bedrooms.,,,,,,
,705,Felt The Drinks Prices Were A Little Steep And The Charge Of Â£4 For A Latte Was Ridiculous. Should Be Drink Facilities In The Room& Bath Robes.,,,,,,
,706,Do You Offer Chocolates Or Dipped Strawberries In The Room (As Extras?),,,,,,
,709,Deliver Iron Requested Without Chase. More Luxurious Rooms. Cleared Plates Away Promptly After Course Finished.,,,,,,
,710,Only Be Quicker With The Service. I Appreciate Enjoying My Evening At A Relaxed Pace When When I Ask For The Bill I Am Ready To Leave And Do Not Enjoy Sitting Trying To Catch The Waiters Attention To Ask Where The Bill Is. The Bill On Checkout Was Also Inaccurate And Although Quickly Sorted  Was Not Expected.,,,,,,
,711,Could Have Just Done A Little Better. See Comments Previously And The Lack Of Tea /Coffee Was A Real Niggle. Even The French Supply That Now. Chains At Â£19Pn Supply That. Gin Bar Was A Little Disappointing. Engagement With The Bar Man Was Mininimaal With No Rel Discussion  I Said What I Normally Drank Was Offered Three Run Of The Mill Alternatives No Offer To Taste And Felt It Was ' Well Order One'.,,,,,,
,720,It Is A Shame That Little Things Let You Down   Not Confirming Dinner On Arrival Not Having Bar Menu Not Having Bar Staff At All Times ,,,,,,
,723,Better Website Pictures To Reflect Bedrooms And Ranges Showercap As Part Of Basic Amenity,,,,,,
,724,No Caan't Think Of Anything,,,,,,
,734,Due To The Exceptionally Hot Weather The Room Was Very Hot As No Air Con ( Did Not Spoil Overall Experience),,,,,,
,735,Just Please Ensure Your Staff Are Trained  Informed And Able To Provide The Basics Like Check-In  Check-Out And At Table Service To The Highest Possible Standards.,,,,,,
,736,Stop The Refuse Collection Making So Much Noise Early Morning.,,,,,,
,742,No.,,,,,,
,743,I Think I Have Mentioned Them,,,,,,
,751,Staff Needs To Be More Welcomeing  And Appreciate Guests Needs,,,,,,
,753,The People Were Great  It Was Just The Room. We Had Stayed At Another (Cheaper) Hotel For The 2 Previous Nights  And That Room Was Much Nicer  So We Felt A Bit Shirt Changed.,,,,,,
,754,Not Really,,,,,,
,759,I'm Not In The Habit Of Complaining. I Realise Running This Hotel Requires A Lot Of Collaboration With Teams Of Staff. Maybe We Hit A Bad Weekend. It Can Happen. Good Luck For The Future.,,,,,,
,761,Wifi Throughout The Premises  Including All Of The Rooms ?,,,,,,
,762,No,,,,,,
,763,I Have Very High Standards Of The Feathers As Previous Stays Have Always Been Above And Beyond. It Is For This Reason Only That I Can Not Put 'Exceeded'. You Can Not Exceed The Perfection I've Come To Love About And Expect From Staying With You!,,,,,,
,766,Informed Us The Room Would Not Include A Bath. Provided A Bigger Quantity Of Food At Dinner Provided The Correct Food At Breakfast Clean The Room Throughly And Give A Comfy  Non Squeeky Bed!,,,,,,
,767,Better Timings In The Restaurant  But Still Had An Excellent Time,,,,,,
,768,The Evening Meal Was Very Good In Terms Of Presentation However The Portions Were Very Small ( Even For A Gourmet Tasting Menu) And The Flavour Was Lacking In One Or Two Of The Dishes- Just A Little Bland.,,,,,,
,771,So Much Good  But Given Price I Was Expecting A Greater Attention To Detail (Eg Smoking Fire  Bin Etc In Bedroom  Confusion Over Veggie Booking  Wait For Tea  Key With Number Sellotaped On).  'Nearly But Not Quite.' Sorry,,,,,,
,774,Our Room (28) Was Far Too Hot With 3 Radiators  Even With Windows Open And No Way Of Turning Them Down. Better Restaurant Experience ...More Attention To Detail As Advertised As Sister Hotel To Lords Of The Manor. Bar Lacks Atmosphere.,,,,,,
,782,Could Not Get Internet To Work And Staff Said This Was Usual,,,,,,
,786,Car Parking Would Be Helpful. On Street Parking Is Free But The Council Signs Do Not Say As Such. I Would Imagine This To Be A Big Issue In The Height Of The Season.,,,,,,
,788,I Was Really Pleased - My Husband And I Got A Welcoming  Peaceful Retreat For Our Wedding Anniversary.,,,,,,
,791,No. It Was Our Choice To Climb To The Room. ,,,,,,
,796,Find Some Parking!!,,,,,,
,797,As Said Earlier We Missed The Amazing Chef You Used To Have  Which Is The Reason We Had Re-Booked.,,,,,,
,801,No,,,,,,
,804,Nothing Whatsoever  A Great Experience,,,,,,
,805,Nothing Whatsoever,,,,,,
,806,Only By Putting Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Rooms.,,,,,,
,807,Parking Is Difficult,,,,,,
,815,I Thought The Bedroom Was Lovely And The Bathroom Well Appointed - And Great To Have The Wi Fi   I Have Put My Additional Comments Elsewhere In This Document,,,,,,
,817,The Bed Room Needs To Be Re-Furbished. Very Poor Quality. Ill Equipped. And The Counter Top In The Bathroom Was Not Cleaned Properly,,,,,,
,823,No,,,,,,
,829,More Ambience,,,,,,
,838,No Thank You.,,,,,,
,841,Have Quicker Room Service ,,,,,,
,844,I Ordered Some Tea One Afternoon - Biscuits Would Be Nice.  I First Stayed At The Feathers 30 Years Ago And Home Made Shortbread Was Always Served.  More Information In The Room Such As Breakfast Times Etc Would Be Helpful.,,,,,,
,846,Had To Ask You To Correct The Invoice - We Were Nearly Charged Twice - But All Done Without Fuss,,,,,,
,847,The Restaurant  As Previously Commented On And Punctuality Of Breakfast Room Service..,,,,,,
,848,No.,,,,,,
,852,Coffee And Tea In The Room,,,,,,
,854,The Dinner Menu Was Not Very Enticing. Signs On The Staircases Would Be Helpful  Got Lost And Tried All 3 … ,,,,,,
,857,Dining Room Staff Generally Less Engaged And Helpful Instructions Re Parking,,,,,,
,858,Slightly Sharper Service  Although Not In Your Face,,,,,,
,862,Accuracy Of Booking. We Were Charged The Full Amount At Checkout Even Though We Had Already Paid Great Escapes. We Were Charged For A Bottle Of Wine But Had Only Had 2 Glasses. Both These Were Rectified At Once,,,,,,
,863,Tea And Coffee Making Facilities In The Room,,,,,,
,869,Honestly  It's Hard Too Thnk Of Anything. We Loved The Gin Bar And Tasting  And The The Christmas Gift Of Sloe Gin And The Beautiful Glasses Was Wonderful.  The Food Was Exceptional  Service Over The Top.  We Had Great Fun At The Pantomime And Thank You For The Tickets!,,,,,,
,870,I Thought The Service Charge Should Not Have Been On The Printed Bill  But At My Discretion. ,,,,,,
,876,All Mentioned Before. Also For Some Reason The Flannels Were Not Refreshed Despite Us Putting Them On The Bathroom Floor. Instead They Were Picked Off The Floor And Put On The Towel Radiator!!! We Requested Fresh Flannels And They Were Delivered Accordingly.,,,,,,
,887,You Need To Train Your Kitchen And Restaurant Staff Better....Service Was Good But Let Down By Poor Food And Incorrect Delivery Of Orders. ,,,,,,
,889,Our Complaint Was Dealt With Helpfully. 2 Gins We Could Not Have Had Appeared On Our Account. Again Dealt With Courteously.,,,,,,
,890,No,,,,,,
,891,Not Really,,,,,,
,892,No!,,,,,,
,894,We Don't Think So. Our Stay Really Was The Glittering Star On The Top Of Our Christmas Tree.,,,,,,
,895,Our Experience Was Probably Somewhere Between Met And Exceeds  Rather Than Just Met.  Just A Few Small Things That Have Let You Down  Including The Bill Being Incorrect On Check Out.,,,,,,
,896,No,,,,,,
,899,Sunshine (It Was Xmas When We Visited),,,,,,
,901,It Was Good!,,,,,,
,905,See Previous Comments. A Better Level Of Service And Communication Both Written And Verbal. You State You Are A Hotel But It Definitely Felt More Like A Pub Environment With Rooms. ,,,,,,
,909,As Before More Information About The Wines And The Gins Would Have Been Appreciated. ,,,,,,
,915,We Would Have Preferred To Have Dined With You  But That Was Beyond Your Control! ,,,,,,
,918,Wrong Newspaper Delivered In Morning  Bill Had Items On It We Had Not Ordered. It Would Be Nice To Have A Biscuit With Tea/Coffee Served In The Room,,,,,,
,925,See Earlier Comments.,,,,,,
,929,No - Not Really,,,,,,
,932,Whilst It Was Lovely To Have Log Burning Fires  I Found Them A Little Smokey!,,,,,,
,933,Service In The Bar And Restuarant Needs Improving,,,,,,
,938,No,,,,,,
,939,We Are Likely To Return But Felt That Our Recent Visit Wasn't Quite Up To The Standard Of Previous Visits.,,,,,,
,940,If A Guest Was Staying One Night You Could Offer To Match The Offer The Second Night,,,,,,
,941,Whilst Staff Were Happy To Deliver Tea/Coffee To Our Room  It Would Be Nice To Have Those Facilities In Your Room. We Also Understood We Could Have Tea In The Lounge But Were Charged For It But Not A Problem  Just Needs To Be Made Clearer.,,,,,,
,943,No,,,,,,
,944,No I Think You Have It Just Right  Well Done!,,,,,,
,947,Possibly More Guidance On Places To Visit,,,,,,
,949,Had Some Parking - Difficult In Woodstock I Know
Or Even A Valet Parking Service So That It Was Easier To Get Bags In To The Hotel. ,,,,,,
,958,Enhance The Wifi ,,,,,,
,964,I Refer To Comment Above,,,,,,
,965,Not To Have Run Out Of The 1724 Tonic Before I Had Chance To Try The Ultimate G&T.,,,,,,
,968,Shame You Can't Magic Up Car Parking!,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
23,Do You Have Any Further Comments?,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,,
,4,None,,,,,,
,5,We Did Enjoy The Feathers And Would Return But Would Probably Eat Out Next Time For Dinner.,,,,,,
,6,I Think It's Covered Under Dining Experience.,,,,,,
,10,On Arrival It Was Explained That There Are No Tea & Coffee Making Facilities Within The Room But That We Could Request Them At Any Time And They Would Be Brought Into The Room. There Was No Mention That A Fee Would Be Payable And When The Bill Was Provided At Checkout There Were Additional Costs Of Â£15.00 For Drinks Which We Thought Should Have Been Complimentary.,,,,,,
,12,I Did You A Review Ln Trip Advisor And Had Confirmation But Cannot Find It.,,,,,,
,14,Improved Wifi Signal In Rooms Could Be A Great Plus,,,,,,
,18,Computer Glitch With The Account That Was Tactfully And Pleasantly Dealt With By The Check Out Receptionist,,,,,,
,23,Loovly Place,,,,,,
,28,As A Family We Have Used The Feathers For 3 Events  1 Went Well The Latest 2 Fell Short Of Expectation. The Feathers Needs To Provide A More Coherent And Professional Service To Its Customers To Warrant The Prices Being Charged.,,,,,,
,37,Thought Room A Bit Overpriced. We Had It On A Good Rate From Booking.Com But Even So I Thought It A Little Overpriced,,,,,,
,41,Gin Bar Far Too Expensive,,,,,,
,42,After Leaving You I Went Elsewhere For A Couple Of Days. It Was Irritating  Upon Getting Home  To Find Two Emails Asking For This Survey To Be Completed. I Wouldn't Really Describe It As 'Short'  Either.,,,,,,
,43,Very Good Impression Of The Feathers And Would Recommend It To Acquaintances.,,,,,,
,45,We'll Be Back. The Â£60 Allowance For Dinner Was An Excellent Marketing Idea. Made Value For Money Great. Breakfast Was A Pleasure. Didn't Eat For The Rest Of The Day.,,,,,,
,46,It Was Disappointing On Checking Out To Find A 99 Pound Entry That Was Not Applicable.  This Was Quickly Rectified But Had The Effect Of Distracting Us From The 22 Pound Charge For Risotto That Was Listed On The Menu As 14 Pounds And A 4 Pound Entry For A Pinot Which We Did Not Have.   It Would Appear Reasonable To Suggest That The Account Section Of Your Orgnization Needs To Improve.,,,,,,
,50,Small Rooms Need Some Furniture Taking Out So There Is More Room To Walk Round The Room.,,,,,,
,51,I Am Unsure Of The Room Number But We Stayed One Night On The 8Th May. Mr & Mrs Cole. Email Address Sm.Cole@Hotmail.Co.Uk.,,,,,,
,54,Most Important Aspect I Believe Is To Ensure A Warm Greeting On Arrival - Which We Didn't Get After An Almost 2 Hour Drive To Get There.,,,,,,
,56,We Shall Definitely Return.,,,,,,
,68,Thank You For A Very Memorable And Relaxing Stay At The Feathers. We Will Definitely Be Returning In The Future And Look Forward To Seeing You Again.,,,,,,
,69,Such A Shame That There Were A Few Little Grievances As Otherwise It Was Really Excellent!,,,,,,
,70,Just A Personal Thank You For Eventually Finding My Raincoat That I Inadvertantly Left In The Wardrobe - Much Appreciated; Thank You Emily For Perservering In Tracking It Down!,,,,,,
,72,Afternoon Tea Was Very Nice  Too Much Slate Used In The Restaurant,,,,,,
,73,A Truly Lovely Experience And Chance To Catch Up With Old Friends. Thank-You So Much  Keep Up The Excellent Work.,,,,,,
,74,In Q19 I Have Answered Honestly - There Was An Error On The Account; However  It Was Corrected Efficiently  Courteously And With Full Apology.,,,,,,
,78,My Stay At The  Feathers Was My First Night In The Cotswolds And Was A Perfect Start To My Trip. Woodstock Is A Charming Town And I Will Make Sure That I Return.,,,,,,
,80,No  All Was Good Thank You,,,,,,
,81,What A Disappointment....Hotel Is Lovely But Food Totally Failed To Match It. All Seemed Lacking A Good Manager.,,,,,,
,82,We Came On A Travelzoo Deal And Felt That Even This Was Not Value For Money. All Said  We Did Enjoy Our Stay But You Did Ask For An Honest Opinion And Therefore We Have Provided You With Our Comments For Your Perusal.,,,,,,
,85,The Hotel Is Charming  An Eclectic Mix Of Interesting Styles. The Service Was Disjointed  A General Feeling Of Lack Of Cohesion. A Fire In The Study Would Have Made The Sumptuous Tea A Truly Memorable Experience.,,,,,,
,86,I Shall Watch Trip Advisor With Interest.  If Your Staffing Levels Improve We Should Be Delighted To Return  As The Food Is Simply Stunning - Especially The Gin-Tasting Menu.,,,,,,
,92,One Of Our Best Ever Weekends.  Thank You.,,,,,,
,93,The Only Other Negative Comment Is That We Were Woken Up Very Early  And Very Loudly  By Room Service Being Delivered To Two Of The Neighbouring Rooms!  This Could Be Done A Lot More Quietly And Discreetly. Overall Though  We Loved The Feathers And Particularly Bleneim  And We Would Like To Come Back At Some Point With Our Little Boy.,,,,,,
,96,We Stayed For Our Wedding Anniversary And Because Of This I Ordered A Bottle Of Champagne For The Room. This Was Not Provided So I Ordered One Through Room Service. On Check Out I Was Charged For Two Bottles Of Champagne!!!  I Had To Point Out This Mistake. I Feel Overall That Our Experience Was Not Good Value For Money,,,,,,
,98,We Are Looking Forward To Our Next Stay!,,,,,,
,104,I Liked The Sitting Area Where One Could Read Or Use The Internet. An Attractive And Quiet Area.,,,,,,
,106,I Think That Guests Should Be Warned Of This Type Of Event.  It Has A Major Impact On A Stay In Woodstock & At The Feathers.  We'd Been Trying To Plan A Visit For Ages And It Spoiled The Overall Experience For Us.  We Would Not Have Visited At This Time If We Had Known What Was In Store.,,,,,,
,110,It Was Many Years Since We Had Stayed And The Hotel Has Changed A Lot. It Was Our Fault For Not Checking The Website First. However Despite The Changes The Bed Was Very Uncomfortable And Sadly We Are Unlikely To Return,,,,,,
,111,Wonderful Hotel,,,,,,
,113,Kettle In Room,,,,,,
,120,We Would Not Have Stayed With You Without The Travelzoo Offer As We Are Retired And On A Limited Budget.,,,,,,
,121,I Would Like To Think That  If We Come Again  We Would Be Given A Room On A Lower Floor!,,,,,,
,122,We Loved The Quirks And Old Charm Of The Hotel And Our Room At The Top Was Lovely.  But A Better Level Of Service Would Have Seen Us Give This Stay Top Marks.,,,,,,
,124,Stayed 2 Nights And Sheets Not Changed And Even Bath Towels Just Folded Up And Put Back On Towel Rail!  Expect More In This Class Of Hotel,,,,,,
,125,I Would Like To See More Informal Seating In The Gin Bar.  I Thought The Tables And Chairs Too Formal For A Relaxing Drink. Mr Carpenter Would Like To See Tea And Coffee Facilities In The Room.,,,,,,
,126,I Have Stayed Many Times At The Feathers. This Was The Worst Stay By Some Margin And Was Poor Enough To Consider Whether I Would Come Back Or Try Out Somewhere Else In Oxford. What A Shame.,,,,,,
,127,The Girl Working In The Gin Bar Was Really Pleasant And Friendly And Made Every Effort To Please And Explain About The Different Gins.,,,,,,
,130,We Had A Little Problem With The Reservation And The Food But The Hotel Manager Was Very Good With It  Very Profesional!!!!! We Left The Hotel Happy. Thank You For That.,,,,,,
,133,Account Was Wrong Because Of The Chimney Fire And Everyone Was Very Pushed! Very Easily And Quickly Rectified By Yourselves Who Spotted The Mistake!! Thank You,,,,,,
,136,Overall I Was Very Impressed With The Food Gin Bar And Service. I Just Found The Room (I Think It Was Suite 2) A Bit Bland  Although I Had Stayed In A Cinema Suite At The Hotel Du Vin Cambridge On The Previous Night Which Was Amazing (May Have Set The Bar Very High). My Girlfriend Had Stayed At The Hotel Previously And Said It Was A Vast Improvement.,,,,,,
,139,Complimentary Morning Coffees For Residents Is A Great Idea - Especially As They Are Not Just Normal Coffee But From The Espresso Machine. Its Little Touches Like This That Make The Difference And Set You Apart From Other Hotels. Not Sure If We Like The Discretionary Service Charge On The Hotel Bill - Never Come Across This In Any Other Hotel We've Stayed At. We Like To Leave Personal Gratuities Where Deserved.,,,,,,
,143,I Did Have A Very Enjoyable Birthday Celebration At Your Hotel.,,,,,,
,144,Room Service Was Prompt And Efficient.,,,,,,
,147,Love The Hotel But Was Lacking A Little In Ambiance This Time Round. We Decided That Background Music Would Have Been An Advantage In The Dining Room Because  Even Although There Were Several Couples Having Breakfast The Room Was So Quiet And Everyone Was Whispering Self Consciously.,,,,,,
,149,We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay  The Food And Service Was Fantastic And The Room Luxurious And Clean. It Was Good Value On The Offer We Booked Through And Located Very Conveniently For Bicester Shopping!,,,,,,
,152,Wonderful Stay And Would Be Even More Wonderful If I Could Have The Cauliflower Soup Recipe Asap Due To The Length Of Time I Have Left To Live Sadly.,,,,,,
,154,A Really Good/Exceptional Experience Just Blighted By One Key Failing.,,,,,,
,155,Thank You For Making Our Anniversary Night So Special!,,,,,,
,162,The Gin Bar Was Great And Knowledge Was Very Good,,,,,,
,164,Its All In Email!!!,,,,,,
,166,Perhaps Your Website Could Say That Parking Is Free Outside The Hotel  But I Suppose It Was A Nice Surprise To Find The Parking Restrictions Were Not Enforced.,,,,,,
,170,We Felt We Only Had To Option To Do The Taster Menu  No One Advised If We Could Change And Pay The Difference.  Upon Finding That The Taster Menu Was Not To Our Satisfaction  The Taster Was Exactly That And Not All Of The Small Courses Were Liked.  At This Stage We Would Of Decided To Stop The Taster Menu And Order A Further Meal From Another Menu As Eating So Little And Not Liking Each Course Left Us Deflated And Slightly Hungry.  Special Courses Were Catered For With The Lacto Intolerant Person  But Again No Choice To Opt Out If Not Liked.,,,,,,
,171,Our Day Was Perfect And We Felt That The Staff Went Above And Beyond Their Duties.  Eg The Champagne Brought To The Church And The Pumpkin Carving For The Children.  Brilliant Service Throughout.,,,,,,
,179,Thank You For Making Our Stay Any Partners Birthday Special,,,,,,
,186,We Think The Value And Quality Of Dining Experience Was Strong. The Accommodation Was A Little Pricey. Also Surprised That When We Checked On Your Website There Was No Rooms Showing As Available When We Could Find A Feature Room On Laterooms.,,,,,,
,187,We Enjoyed The Celebration In Spite Of The Fire And Were Looked After. We Hope We Can Return Sometime And Experience The Courtyard Also.,,,,,,
,188,I Was Also Very Unhappy That The Wine Cellar Keys Were Not Available As A Member Of Staff Had Taken Them Home (!) And I Could Not Have The Wine I Ordered With Dinner. I Had Made Sure That You Stocked Good Wines When I Made The Booking As This Is Equally As Important To Me When Dining  But I Was Hugely Disappointed And Ended Up With A Mediocre Glass Of Rioja. However  The Manager Was Very Apologetic  But This Does Not Detract From It Spoiling My Experience In Your Restaurant. On A Positive Point  I Felt That The Breakfast Manager Was Excellent And I Hugely Enjoyed This Dining Experience More Than Dinner - Which Is A First For Me!!!,,,,,,
,190,A Superb Mini Break And With The Offer We Were On ( Meals And Tickets To Blenheim Palace) Which Was Excellent Value For Money. Have Recommended Already To Friends And Family And Now Looking For Our Next Place Of Interest To Go To.,,,,,,
,198,We Really Enjoyed Our Stay With You And Stay In Hotels Very Regularly  Would Definitely Return And Would Recommend  It Was Also Great Value. Many Thanks,,,,,,
,202,This Is Way More Than You'd Normally Get In A Survey Out Of Me...,,,,,,
,208,Have Stayed At The Feathers Often  In Fact Spending One Christmas With Our Family But This Time Did Not Feel It Had Quite The Same Old World Charm,,,,,,
,213,We Would Love To Return At Some Point If Better Overall Experience Was Guaranteed :-),,,,,,
,214,Given An Incorrect Bill.  After Card Experience  Not Impressed.,,,,,,
,215,I Would Love To Return . Please Keep Me Informed Of Offers,,,,,,
,216,Thought The Newspaper Style Room Guide Was A Great Idea And Enjoyed Reading About The History Of The Hotel. Although We Arrived Before Our Room Was Ready  Staff Were More Than Happy To Look After Our Bags. Parking Was A Bit Tricky  But Staff Were Helpful In Telling Us That The Restriction Notices No Longer Applied. We Had A Thoroughly Enjoyable Stay.,,,,,,
,217,Great Hotel  Would Stay Again - Just A Few Minor Hiccups - Without Those It Would Have Been Perfect And For The Price It Should Be Perfect.,,,,,,
,222,Overall A Very Pleasant Experience. Thank You,,,,,,
,225,Good Luck And We Shall Come Back One Day.,,,,,,
,229,Although The Final Account Was Inaccurate  Staff Were Professional And Efficient In Correcting The Error.,,,,,,
,230,It Met Our Expectations Because We Have Stayed Here Before  We Think The Hotel Is Excellent And When It Is Excellent Again It 'Meets Our Expectations'. Do Not Take It As A Negative.,,,,,,
,231,Great Welcome Even With Our Dog - Definitely Dog Friendly (Not Just Dog Tolerant !) Loved It,,,,,,
,233,If You Have Any Offers In The Future Please Contact! We Would Love To Come Again  One Night Stay Was Not Enough...,,,,,,
,235,We Both Agreed That We Would Definitely Stay Again.  I Have Also Put A Review On Tripadvisor.,,,,,,
,236,Greeting Was Very Good And Then The Room Was A Disappointment. For A Hotel Of A 4 Star Rating This Was Poor.  Had We Booked A Longer Stay We Would Have Asked For A Change Of Room.  I Understand We Took This On A Travelzoo Voucher But This Should Not Have Made A Difference.,,,,,,
,239,We Enjoyed Our Stay But Please See Comments On Dining And Room Facilities. I Would Have Been Very Disappointed Had I Paid Full Price.,,,,,,
,242,I Am Grateful That You Found A Room For Me At Fairly Short Notice  And That On Arrival My Wife And I Were Welcomed And Very Courteously Treated. We Were Sorry Not To Have The Opportunity Of Dining In Your Hotel : We Had Dined Earlier  With Friends Nearby.,,,,,,
,244,Lovely Stay - Thank You.,,,,,,
,249,We Will Stay Again And Recommend Your Hotel.,,,,,,
,253,Your Staff Are Helpful  Or As Helpful As They Can Be. And You Do Have A Delightful Hotel.,,,,,,
,257,Drink Prices At The Bar Were A Bit Top-Heavy.,,,,,,
,259,We Had A Lovely Time And Much Appreciated The Surprise Upgrade To Our Room. When We Went Out For A Drink After Dinner (In The Rain/Snow) The Receptionist Gave Us An Umbrella Which Was Very Kind!,,,,,,
,266,The Room Was Not Good Value For Money - I.E. It Was Over-Priced. While The Setting Was Pleasant  The Food In The Restaurant Was Over-Priced And Was Often Disappointing. For Example  The Tuna At Lunch Was A Ver Small Portion And Did Not Have Much Flavour.,,,,,,
,268,Thank You All For A Lovely Break. Will Definitely Return And Recommend.,,,,,,
,270,I Think We Have Said Enough!,,,,,,
,271,We Didnt Pay The Service Charge - The Service Was Ok But We Felt Did Not Warrant The Charge. I Do Object To It Being Added Automatically To The Bill. If Asked If We Want To Pay Something We Would Have Made A Gesture.,,,,,,
,277,Music In The Restaurant Is Also Rather Mundane.,,,,,,
,278,Please Pass On Our Complements To The Chef And Ben As The Food Was Outstanding And Ben Was Superb,,,,,,
,283,My Only Observation Was That We Did Have To Wait 5-10 Min On 2 Occasions For Service .Firstly At The Bar Just After Arrival To The Point We Were Unsure It Was Open Or Not .Eventually A Member Of Staff Did Turn Up But Was Not Very Knowledgeable Of The Products Behind The Bar And So I Was Quite Dissapointed I Couldn't Try One Of The Gin Combinations Mentioned In The Brochure And Also My Husband Was Served An Entirely Different Drink Than He'd Asked For So We Had To Return To The Bar To Request The Correct Drink. The Second Time Was On Departure And Myself And A Number Of Other Guests Were Left Waiting Again For 5/10 Min Before A Staff Member Appeared.,,,,,,
,286,Thank You For A Lovely Stay And We Will Return For Another Experience.,,,,,,
,289,We Had Booked Dinner For Four But  In The Event  We Were Joined By Two More.  The Staff Were Most Obliging In Accommodating The Additional Booking And Setting A Table For Six In The Bar Area.  Also  A Non Meat Eating Member Had A Suitable Substitution For The Meat Course.  Many Thanks For This Individual Level Of Service,,,,,,
,291,No,,,,,,
,293,There Were Some Nice Touches  For Example  The Vast Knowledge Of The Gin Bar Waiter; And Having The Bill Ready For When I Came To Check Out.,,,,,,
,302,Food Was Great,,,,,,
,305,These Days We Do Not Often Visit The Cotswolds Having Been Many Times Before. There Is Usually A Reason And This Time We Wanted To Spend A Day At Blenheim Palace. We Could Not Have Chosen A Better Place To Stay.,,,,,,
,312,Would Have Preferred Tea / Coffee Making Facilities In The Room.  Having Stayed At Other Luxury Hotels Where This Has Been Discreetly Placed Inside Large Drawers We Know This Is Possible.  Alternatively Offering A Tea Delivery For Early Morning Would Have Been Wonderful.,,,,,,
,315,Staff Were Extrememly Friendly And Helpful  Lovely Place And Great Restaurant.  Only Two Minor Gripes Above Prevented It From Being Absolutely Perfect.....,,,,,,
,316,Thank You Again For All That We Experienced At The Feathers Making The Weekend A Very Special Occasion.,,,,,,
,317,Q19. Minor Point. The Water We Had With Dinner Hadnt Been Added To The Bill But Was Quickly Amended At Reception,,,,,,
,318,No,,,,,,
,319,I Would Word It 'Sad To Leave'... But  We Could Have Stayed Much Longer.... When Checking Our Bill At Home We Noticed It Was Accurate. We Do Hope That The Service Was Included As There Was No Specification Of It In Our Bill. Please  Let Us Know Otherwise And We Will Be Very Happy To Say Thanks In A Few Notes.   We Look Forward To Seeing You Soon. Thank You Again.  Mr And Mrs Harvey.,,,,,,
,328,Please Don;T Change A Thing - We'll Be Back!!,,,,,,
,330,It Was A Little Chilly In The Dining Room..But We Closed The Window,,,,,,
,331,I Feel The Mistake At Breakfast Was Made Because Of A Lack Of Communication Amongst The Serving Staff,,,,,,
,333,Thank You To The Whole Team For Making Our Visit Pleasurable.,,,,,,
,335,No,,,,,,
,338,No,,,,,,
,340,See You Again Soon  I Hope,,,,,,
,341,I Think It Is Such A Shame That Housekeeping Let You Down.  The Room Was Lovely.   I Think Service Overall Appears To Be Slightly Disjointed.   Also   It Would Have Been Nice To See The Manager At Some Point Given The Issues We Had Had   Although To Be Fair He Did Call And May Not Have Been On Site.,,,,,,
,343,Fantastic,,,,,,
,349,Was Not Aware We Had To Book The Gin Tasting  So We Missed Out On That.  However The Waiter Recommended Us A Couple Of Good Gins.,,,,,,
,350,We Have Stayed In Hotels All Over The World And We Would Rate The Feathers At The Top Of The List. We Were Very Impressed With The Whole Stay  From The Moment We Entered The Hotel To The Moment We Left. We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome By All Staff  Who Could Not Do Enough To Assist Us. We Will Definitely Return With Friends Later This Year.,,,,,,
,352,We Will Not Dine With You Again If We Stay,,,,,,
,354,Great To Have Free Wi-Fi.  The Gin Bar Was Superb And The Outside Seating Area Lovely In The Sunshine,,,,,,
,357,Otherwise My Wife And I Enjoyed Our Stay At Your Hotel.,,,,,,
,360,I Still Cannot Understand Why A Service Charge Was Added To Our Account (Only Noticed Afterwards) - It Is Not At All Obvious To What It Applies Ie It Does Not Appear To Be 10% Of Anything.,,,,,,
,361,Overall A Very Pleasant Experience,,,,,,
,371,We Have Stayed On Previous Occasions. Once In A Suite Which Was A Real Treat. We Will Stay Again As Soon As We Can,,,,,,
,376,Apart From Above All Ok,,,,,,
,380,Please Don't Take My Negative Comments To Represent A Bad Time. We Ate Drank And Took Everything In Our Stride. We Had A Nice Time,,,,,,
,382,Lovely Hotel The Gin Tasting Was Excellent And Was Well Explained By The Bar Manager,,,,,,
,384,At Breakfast On !St Morning Milk In Jug Was Sour,,,,,,
,385,The Chairs In Dining Room Also Very Comfortable. Nice Ambience And Liked The Feathers Carpet. Would Be Integrated In Knowing Who Manufactured It.,,,,,,
,386,We Travelled In From California And Jet Lag Made Getting Up In The Morning A Bit Challenging. My Son Was About 5 Mins Late To Breakfast And Was Refused Service. That Was Disappointing To Me.,,,,,,
,387,Very Nice Hotel  I Would Just Question The Value Proposition. I Thought The Price Was High For The Facilities Available. Thic Would Make Me Hesitate Next Time.,,,,,,
,390,All Lovely . Thankyou,,,,,,
,391,Look Forward To Staying With You Again Very Soon!,,,,,,
,392,Pleasant Stay With Great Gin Collection!,,,,,,
,401,Overall Excellent,,,,,,
,404,Thank You For This Survey But So Far All I Have Done Is Booked The Trip  I Haven't Actuall Stayed Yet!,,,,,,
,405,Did Not Anticipate The Parking Problems.,,,,,,
,414,No,,,,,,
,415,I Have Detailed Both Positive And Negative Comments Only Because We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay Yet Felt Some Fine Tuning Is Required. Hope You Remain A Warm And Inviting Place Whilst Continuously Improving The Service And Some Of The Dated Facilities.,,,,,,
,417,A Very Pleasant Stay All Round And Good Value For Money.,,,,,,
,418,No,,,,,,
,426,Why Did You Send This Questionnaire?,,,,,,
,427,Lovely Stay.,,,,,,
,428,We Hadnt Read Trip Advisor Before Booking This Break Through Secret Escapes Because I Knew Of The Hotel's Repution.  Given Other Reviews For The Weekend Previous To Ours  I Wonder If The Teams Of Staff Work Every Other One... As I Said Pre Arrival Communications Were Great -Emily I Think - But From The Point Of Being Shown Our Room  Which Was Along The Street  With The Staircase Leading To At Least Two Rooms Above Us Running Along The Bed Head Wall  It Went Downhill Rapidly! The Receptionist Didn't Offer Any Information On The Hotel Other Than Give Us The Hotel Information Which Is A Printed Leaflet (Different From The Usual Folder In Yr Room.) No Offer Of Newspapers  Direction Of The Lounge Area Etc. The Bedroom Itself Was Fine  The Bathroom Lovely. However The Customer Service Is Appalling. When We Did Get The Refreshments Mentioned Before  The  Afternoon Tea Included In Our Package  Was Very Nice. We Turned Up For Breakfast At Approx 9.45Am (10.30 Closing) On Saturday Having Been Woken By What We Assume Were Staff Delivering The Papers And Then Room Service From Approx 7.30Am To The Rooms Upstairs- Front Door Banged  Travelling Up The Stairs  Down The Stairs  Door Banged Again - Get The Picture? Arriving Back In Reception I Asked The Receptionist If We Should Wait To Be Seated Or Just Go In To The Restaurant For Breakfastband Was Totally Ignored. He Continued Looking At His Pc! We Went In To Find A Distinct Lack Of Cleared Tables And Not A Staff Member To Be Seen. 5 Minutes Or So Later Staff Returned And Began To Clear The Tables And Laid One For Us. Not A Friendly Face In Sight Sadly. No Cereal Bowls At The Buffet Table. However Breakfast Was Indeed Delicious With Good Choices On The Menu. Fruit Juices Was Lovely Too. Toast Was Decidly Weird - Appeared To Be Warmed Ciabatta. We Returned For Supper In The Hotel. Service Was Fine  Staff In Fact Very Nice And The Food Was Superb. Good Choice Of Wines.  Bar Man Very Friendly.  Returning To Our Room  We Were Grateful That The Guests Above Retired At Around The Same Time As Us Saving Us From The Disruption We'd Encountered The Night (& Morning) Before. Breakfast On Sunday Was Much The Same - No Clean Tables Available  No Offer Of Juices (Though Did Arrive After Request) No Bowls. Food Took Much Longer As Well And Despite Making The Same Order  The Content Was Different. We Weren't The Last In So Others Would Have Received Similar Service To Us. It Also Took 15 Minutes At Least To Check Out Due To A Lack Of Staff. When Asked If We'd Enjoyed Our Stay  Our Response Was 'No  Not Really' To Which The Staff Response Was 'Oh'.  Real Shame Because We Really Needed This Break Away.  ,,,,,,
,429,Made Them Already,,,,,,
,430,Gin Bar Prices Are A Little Excessive - Difficult Not To Feel A Little Fleeced. W Ewill Be Back And We Will Recommend/ Have Recommended Others - You Have A Special Venue - More Offers Like The One We Used And We Will Take It Up!,,,,,,
,432,No Thankyou,,,,,,
,438,Staff Were Very Helpful With Giving Us And Heating Up Milk For Our Toddler,,,,,,
,440,The Only Slip Up Was That We Ordered A Bottle Of Wine To Be In Our Room On Arrival As It Was My Husband's Birthday  And It Wasn't There!  It Got To Us Eventually But It Spoilt The Surprise.,,,,,,
,441,Can't Wait To Stay Again....Chester The Dog Enjoyed Himself Also,,,,,,
,442,Overall  A Great Stay  Excellent Setting And Service. Already Passed Recommendation To Friends And Will Endeavour To Return In The Not Too Distant Future. Thank You To All Staff  A Wonderful  Trouble Free Experience  Hard To Match But Hopefully Easily Maintained.,,,,,,
,443,Staff Are Key. You Have A Lovely Little Hotel But It Could Be Really Good If People Were Proud Of Where They Worked And Really Paid Attention To The Customers.,,,,,,
,444,Despite Minor Gripes Above I Thought The Feathers A Fine Establishment And Really Enjoyed Our Stay - We Have Already Recommended You To Friends And Would Be Happy To Return.,,,,,,
,445,Sharing A Pot Of Tea On The Terrace Was A Simple Pleasure!!,,,,,,
,451,The Stairs To Suite 1 Are Very Steep!,,,,,,
,455,Overall Value For Money And Standards Need Addressing,,,,,,
,459,We Did Tell Reception Of Our Experience,,,,,,
,464,I Would Emphasise That The Food And Service Was Excellent But That The Time Between Courses Was A Little Too Long (Even After Pre-Ordering) Which Meant That Personally  I Couldn't Completely Relax And Enjoy The Experience Fully.,,,,,,
,466,No.,,,,,,
,474,Very Pleasant Stay.  Great Gin And Tonic!,,,,,,
,476,We Wish That Circumstances Had Permitted Us To Try Some Of The Gins,,,,,,
,478,No,,,,,,
,486,There Was A Mix-Up With The Bill When We Left. Our Restaurant Bill Included Â£140 Worth Of Drinks That We Didn't Have! It Was Sorted Out Smoothly And Quickly However.,,,,,,
,489,Having Just Moved To Bladon We Will Probably Not Be Staying So Much In The Future But Will Be Very Happy To Recommend You To Friends And Visitors And We Will Dine With You Again.,,,,,,
,492,Looking Forward To A Further Stay With My Sister And Her Husband For A Special Anniversary At The End Of July,,,,,,
,493,Yes....These Will Be Added To Trip-Advisor  This Is The Least That I Can Do To Show Our Appreciation,,,,,,
,495,Apologies For Taking The Key!,,,,,,
,500,Enjoyed Our Stay Staff Lovely. Drinks Expensive!,,,,,,
,502,A Superb Hotel Which I Recommend Regularly To Friends And Colleagues.,,,,,,
,503,I Am A Regular Visitor To The Feathers  Often Travelling Alone For Business. However On This Occasion Came With Friends.  As Ever The Service And Hospitality Was Impeccable. Many Thanks,,,,,,
,506,Just Check Your Afternoon Tea Goods As Our Scones Were Very Dry. Wasn't A Major Problem But Some People Do Like Complaining!!,,,,,,
,507,Final Account Had Extra Bottle Of Wine Charged But Sorted Quickly And Courteously By Staff,,,,,,
,511,Quality And Standard Was Good Shame About The Hair In Bath   Bath Robe And Breakfast,,,,,,
,512,Oh  There Seemed To Be A Lack Of Ice Saturday Night Which Was A Bit Strange For A Gin Bar. We Had A Nice Stay But I'd Like To See A Few Improvements Before I Book Again.,,,,,,
,516,Wasn't Able To Pay My Bar Bill As The System Was Down. I Presume It Has Been Charged To My Credit Card. Still Haven't Received Copy By Email As Requested. Over All For A Â£200 Night Stay Didn't Think It Was Value For Money. If It Hadn't Of Been For Peter The Manager  Could Have Been A Whole Lot Worse. Nice Hotel  Nice Village. Don't Waste It,,,,,,
,518,I Found The Hotel On Secret Escapes A Couple Of Weeks Ago And As We Celebrated Our 30Th Wedding Anniversary On The 15/10 We Felt It Was Felt It Was Fate As We Stayed At The Feathers For The First Night Of Our Honeymoon!  Obviously  The Hotel Has Changed Significantly Since Then And Very Much For The Better.  If We Were To Visit The Area We Would Stay There Again.,,,,,,
,523,We Paid Â£149.00 For Dinner Bed And Breakfast And Thought It Exceptional Value.  When The Staff Found Out It Was Our Wedding Anniversary They Gave Us A Glass Of Champagne To Celebrate - A Very Nice Touch.  Thank You For Making It A Special Occasion.,,,,,,
,526,We Will Choose Not To Come At The Same Time As Grand Prix Dates  As The Room Costs Were Extremely High.  We Did Love Suite 2 However - Comfortable  Dark And Cosy.  We May Return For 2/3 Days In Late August When En Route From Scotland To France.  Thank You.,,,,,,
,529,Discretionary Service Charge On The Bill Is A Weird Tension That Most Guests Will Not Want To Deal With. Should Be All Inclusive Price,,,,,,
,530,It Was Our First Visit To The Gin Bar - A Great Addition!,,,,,,
,531,I Loved The Weather Report At Breakfast- Nice Touch. We Appreciated Buying Tickets For Blenheim Palace From You  But For Some Reason They Were Not Added To The Bill. As Christians  We Were Keen To Be Honest So Popped Back To Pay The Extra When We Realised. The Receptionist Was Lovely  And Sorted Quickly. Not A Big Issue At All; We Had A Fabulous Week-End To Remember  With Very Helpful Staff. Thank-You!,,,,,,
,545,Enjoyed The Free Morning Coffee Offered After Our Walk Around The Village...Nice Touch,,,,,,
,549,Peter  We Hope Your Wedding In Germany Is A Wonderful Experience And A Very Happy Day!,,,,,,
,551,Thank You To All Staff Who Made Our Stay So Fantastic And Gave My Sister A Birthday To Remember.,,,,,,
,553,A Memorable Stay Once Again. We Will Of Course Return. A Lovely Hotel In A Beautiful Village  So Easy For Exploring The Cotswolds.,,,,,,
,554,While We Stayed At The Feathers We Celebrated Our 40Th Wedding Anniversary. We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome And We Would Like To Compliment You On The High Standards Your Staff Maintain.,,,,,,
,560,An Enjoyable Stay Nonetheless. Thank You.,,,,,,
,561,The Bar Staff Didn't Serve Full Pints Of Cobra. They Needed Topping Up. Girl On The Bar Seemed Flustered With Bar Customers And Had Issues With The Till.,,,,,,
,566,A Really Enjoyable Experience. We Loved The Fact We Had Bleinham Tickets As Well As The Stay At The Hotel. Really Good Value For Money. Staff Were Helpful And Welcoming  Especially In The Restaurant. Thanks For A Lovely Weekend!,,,,,,
,571,It Might Have Been Nice To Have Been Informed That We May Be Woken Early By Deliveries (Which Was The Case...5-6Am!) & The Gin & Tonics Were Very Expensive!,,,,,,
,575,As Part Of A Travelzoo Offer  We Had Paid For A Tasting Meal Worth Â£55.  However  On The Evening That We Dined  The Menu Showed That The Price Was Â£45.  The Fact That The Chef Had Decided To Reduce The Price Does Not Detract From The Fact That The Offer Included The Higher Price.,,,,,,
,578,The Saturday Was Fabulous But The Sunday Wad Disappointing And Spoilt My Impression From The Day Before. I Have Already Mentioned Breakfast. Regarding The Bill It Was Lucky I Had Brought With The Email Confirming Our Offer From The Peugeot Magazine. The Bill We Initially Received Did Not Take The Offer Into Account And Was For Over Â£100 More. The Next Bill Was For Â£10 Or So For The Extras. I Was Honest Enough To Point Out That We Needed To Pay The Â£ 299 Offer Price Too.  After We Left I Realised The 3Rd Bill Was Wrong Too As We Had Been Charged For After Dinner Coffee And Petit Fours Rather Than The Tea On Arrival. I Wasn't Going To Go Back For Â£4 But That Was Sloppy. It Was A Shame As We Were Really Bowled Over By Everything The Day Before. I Would Be Happy For You To  Contact Me About All This On 07775672103 Lesley,,,,,,
,580,Thank You For Making Our Stay So Memorable - My Mother Thoroughly Enjoyed Her Birthday And We Would Both Look To Return In The Near Future.,,,,,,
,581,I Felt The Hotel Was Extremely Over Priced. I Work For An Airline So I Did Get Around Â£60 Discount. The Hotel Stay Was A Gift To My Partner And I Really Did Expect A Higher Standard Of Accommodation For The Money I Paid. Which Is A Shame.,,,,,,
,582,We Did Enjoy The Gin Bar  But It Is Very Overpriced.,,,,,,
,585,We're Looking Forward To Visiting Again To Sample Some More Gin!!,,,,,,
,588,Excellent Hotel - First Rate.,,,,,,
,595,Very Dissappointed With The Whole Experience.,,,,,,
,601,A Fridge  Tea And Coffee Facilities In The Bedroom Would Be A Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,606,We Have Stayed With You Four Or Five Times And This Is The First Time Our Stay Has Not Been Excellent!,,,,,,
,610,Service In The Bar Was Slow. Ordered A Picnic Hamper & It Was Not Mentioned That I Had To Return It. I Had To Make The Effort To Find Out. It Was Lucky I Opened It Before I Left As I Would Have Driven Home Thinking I Had Paid For It As A Package.,,,,,,
,613,No,,,,,,
,614,I Really Liked The Personal Touch Of The Email Subsequent To My Booking Through Booking.Com.  Often When You Book Through Secondary Websites There Is No Contact Between The Confirmation Email And Arrival  So This Was A Nice Touch.,,,,,,
,619,Car Parking Was Difficult  But Outside Of Your Control.,,,,,,
,620,We Were Charged In The Room Rate For Dinner And Also Again On The Night. I Didn't Notice This Until We Got Home But It Had Been Refunded Now.,,,,,,
,621,No,,,,,,
,623,Uninspiring (Sad Looking) Breakfast Table,,,,,,
,631,Previously The Breakfast Was Awful. The Polish Waiter Did Not Understand English And Insisted That The Parma Ham Was Lincolnshire Ham. Clearly Ridiculous And Extremely Aggravating.,,,,,,
,635,You Perhaps Should Consider A Loyalty Reward? We Have Stayed At Your Hotel Many Times And I Think That Would Be A Nice Gesture To Regular Guests?,,,,,,
,636,If You Can Prove To Me That The Hotel Is Back To Its Prior Form We May Come Again But You Are Probably Not Interested In Us As We Are But 2 Of Many-But I Do Think You Will Lose All The Loyal Customers Like Us If The Hotel Continues As We Found It Last Sunday.,,,,,,
,637,I Was Not Too Keen On Being Presented With My Bill With The Service Charge Already Added As A Done Deal.  I Would Have Preferred There To Have Been A Space On The Bill To Add A Discretionary Tip Of My Choosing. I Ended Up Having To Ask The Receptionist To Remove It & Add A Smaller Amount - The Irony Being That Had I Been Given The Choice In The First Place As Opposed To Being Told What To Pay Then I Would Probably Have Paid The Higher Amount!,,,,,,
,639,Nothing To Do With You But I Left My Sleeping Ware In Room 43. Would Be Happy To Pay Postage If You Cpuld Send It Back,,,,,,
,641,Thank You For A Lovely Evening - We Look Forward To Coming Back.,,,,,,
,646,Suite 4 Was Superb,,,,,,
,647,We Had A Lovely Stay...The Service Was Excellent And We Were Made To Feel Very Welcome. The Room Was Not As Clean As We Would Have Expected...Dead Beetle In The Chest Of Draws  Ornate Mirror In Need Of A Good Clean An Polish... Breakfast Was Scrummy  And The Room We Were Given Was Very Lovely. Thank You,,,,,,
,648, Breakfast The First Morning  There Was Nobody To Meet Us. We Waited 10 Mins Only To Hear Raucous Laughter Coming From The Kitchen. Eventually We Ordered Tea. Which When We Poured Out The Milk Into The Milk It Fell Out  It Was Solid And Rotten. Nobody Must Have Checked It. Very Poor Indeed.,,,,,,
,651,My Only Comment Would Be Â£18.50 For A G&T. I Genuinely Do Not Mind Paying For The Exceptional But This Was Not  Don't Know If There Was An Issue  It Tasted Like A G&T But Have Certainly Had Better For Far Less.,,,,,,
,654,The Whole Experience Was A Total Shambles  I Have Had Better Treatment From A Premier Inn . I Usually Stay At The Bear . In Future I Will Be Staying At The Bear,,,,,,
,655,Only That This Survey Has Made Me Check My Final Account And I Have Realised That It Is Incorrect. The Final Invoice Shows That 2 Sb Glasses Of Wine Were Served In The Bar. However We Only Took A Total Of 5 Glasses Of Wine  Not 7 - All Served In The Restaurant. My Fault For Not Fully Checking The Details At The Checkout.,,,,,,
,656,Would Not Have Booked Hotel Had We Known About The Fair,,,,,,
,660,Thank You,,,,,,
,663,The Key For Me Was A Short-Notice Trip And My Office Was Being Able To Book By Telephone Mid Sunday Evening And Be Able To Arrive At 1.0 Am With The Night Staff At Reception.,,,,,,
,664,Love This Hotel.  Hope You Can Keep Up The High Standards.  We Will Definitely Be Back.  Many Thanks,,,,,,
,669,Very Good Could Have Been Excellent,,,,,,
,670,I Had Booked This Break For My Husband's Birthday And We Were Not Disappointed.  Good Value For Money For A Winter Break In A Cosy Hotel In A Beautiful Village.  Would Love To Return When Weather Is Better!,,,,,,
,674,The Furniture In The Study And The Bar Lounge Seemed Out Of Keeping With The Hotel - Lacked Personality.,,,,,,
,680,I Would Like To Thank You For Your Kind Attention To Us And For Fulfilling Your Promise To Provide 3 Free Rooms To Us Because We Had Some Problems When We Stayed At New Year.  Please Know That Honour Is Definitely Satisfied And We Would Now Happily Recommend You.,,,,,,
,688,When We Checked Out We Were Charged 10% On Our Whole Bill But Changed To To The Meal Only. I Dont Think We Should Be Charging Service On The Room Even If It's Optional.,,,,,,
,689,I Feel I Received Value For Money At The Promotion Price. I Would Have Been Disappointed With The Overall Experience If I Had Paid The Rate Quoted On Your Website.,,,,,,
,690,Couldnt Get The Phone To Ring '0'  The Reception.,,,,,,
,692,You Have A Lovely Little Hotel In A Lovely Location. I Felt We Had Good Value In Our Accommodations.  My Criticisms Are Relatively Minor; However  More Attention To Ambiance And Beauty  Especially Outside And In The Rooms Would Be Desirable.,,,,,,
,703,Glad We Didn't Pay Full Price For The Feathers Experience!!,,,,,,
,705,We Had A Fab Stay And The Above Comments Are A Guide Not Criticism  Thank You,,,,,,
,706,Parking Can Be A Challenge! But  We'll Be Back,,,,,,
,708,We Have Stayed A Few Times And Never Had Any Cause For Comment Other Than Positive But This Stay Was Disappointing For Me Personally.,,,,,,
,710,We Did Overall Enjoy Our Stay At The Hotel And Would Return To The Same Room If We Were Staying In The Area Again. Just A Couple Of Points That Would Have Made It Top Notch.,,,,,,
,714,Our Friends David And Justine Edwards Arrive On Sunday With Our Daughter - They Deserve A Good Break And Won't Be Disappointed !,,,,,,
,717,Enjoyed Our Stay. Thank You All.,,,,,,
,723,The Staff Were Super Helpful And Friendly! I Have Stayed In Many 5 Star Hotels For Work  And None Has Service As Friendly And Courteous And What You Have. Your Staff Are A Great Asset To Your Hotel. They Should All Wear A Name Badge So I Could Have Better Commended Them.,,,,,,
,724,Really Helpful Staff That Are Always There To Help If Needed. Lovely Hotel Which Is Extremely Clean And Comfortable And The Food Just Adds To The Luxury!,,,,,,
,727,My Boyfriend Adored A Piece Of Artwork In The Reception Area And I Meant To Find Out If Any Of It Was For Sale But Completely Forgot...Is Any Of It For Sale??,,,,,,
,728,Excellent,,,,,,
,729,The Experience Of Our Stay Was Lovely And Would Want To Stay Again. Just A Shame The Resturant Let You Down,,,,,,
,742,No.,,,,,,
,743,You Did Ask For My Comments And I Believe I Have Been Honest And Constructive. The Feathers Is A Lovely Hotel And Apart From A Few Items Was The Perfect Place For Myself And My Daughter (Who Has Three Children) To Relax. We Would Certainly Stay Again But I Will Have To Bring A Fan Etc.,,,,,,
,752,Probably The Best Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In.,,,,,,
,754,Many Thanks For A Magical Evening And Stay.,,,,,,
,761,No Thanks.,,,,,,
,762,No,,,,,,
,763,Please Keep It Up And We'll Certainly Be Back! We Have Really Enjoyed The Taster Menus That Have Previously Been Available For Dining Options. Would Love To See This Back. Also  A Breakfast Menu / Arrival Info Pack Would Have Been Useful In The Room. Thanks For Making Our Stay So Enjoyable Once Again,,,,,,
,766,All Staff Were Fantastic  V Attentive And Informative. However A Few Basic Needs Were Lacking- Food And Sleep! Unfortunately Not Luxurious As I Think The Hotel Wants To Be Perceived As.,,,,,,
,768,A Very Difficult One In Such A Beautiful Old Building - Try And Resolve The Creaking Floorboards In Room 28 Both For The Occupants And Those In The Room Below?,,,,,,
,774,Nice Comfy Bed And Fabulous Bathroom. Nice To Have The Small Sitting Room To Use After Dinner. Great Location.,,,,,,
,788,The Bill Was Quickly Rectified Without Fuss At The End.  I Wouldn't Stay In Suite 5 Again - Purely Because Of The Road Noise  The Noise From The Restaurant And From Revellers In The Square Outside.  I'd Happily Return Again.  Charming Place And Staff Who Were Helpful And Attentive.,,,,,,
,791,Lovely Overall Experience. Will Be Coming Back As Soon As We Are Able ,,,,,,
,797,No,,,,,,
,801,The Final Account Was Inaccurate  But In Our Favour! We  Of Course  Queried The Exceptional Value And Paid Up!,,,,,,
,804,Keep Us The Good Work,,,,,,
,805,Keep Up The Great Work,,,,,,
,809,Just Want To Say That Our Expectations Were Very High Having Stayed At The Feathers Before And You Did Not Disappoint!  It Is Also Some Kind Of Record For Us To Stay At The Same Hotel Three Times In One Year!!,,,,,,
,810,Thanks ,,,,,,
,823,Generally More Relaxed And Friendly Atmosphere,,,,,,
,826,The Fire Was Most Welcome For Festive Stay We Went Into The Bear For Coffee  No Fire And Drab,,,,,,
,829,No  Loved Your Village  Gorgeous Location.,,,,,,
,837,It Was A Shame That My Complaints Outweighed My Positive Comments.  I Probably Would Try Again And Then If The Situation Stayed The Same I Would Not Stay Again. The Staff Though Were Polite And Friendly And Apologetic. ,,,,,,
,838,If You Have Other Offers Available Through Amazon Local We Will Definitely Return. Unfortunately Your Normal Rates Are A Bit Too Expensive For Us To Return In The Near Future.,,,,,,
,841,Not Enough Night Staff As The Same Girl Had To Keep Running Around For Us ,,,,,,
,844,I Have Stayed Here Many Times But Not In Its Current Incarnation.  Overall I Was Very Pleased Especially With The Cost As I Made A Last Minute Booking.  Sorry But I Do Not Like The Dining Room Carpet Or The Chairs - They Are Somewhat Incongruous.  Loved The Bar Area And Am Now On A Mission To Find The Gin And Tonic That I Tried.,,,,,,
,846,A Lovely Experince For Our Pearl Wedding Anniversary. Have Already Recommended You And We Will Remember Our Stay Fondly For Years To Come,,,,,,
,847,We Look Forward To Our Concerns Being Addressed For When We Next Stay With You?,,,,,,
,848,Will Definitely Keep My Eye Out For Any Future Offers!,,,,,,
,852,If We Were Visiting The Area Again We Would Definitely Use The Hotel Again And Will Recommend It.,,,,,,
,854,Enjoyed Our Stay   Recommended It To Others And Would Live To Come Back,,,,,,
,857,Hotel Side Excellent  Dining Let Down By Less Engaged Staff,,,,,,
,858,We Really Enjoyed It And All The Comments Are Really Intended To Be Constructive ,,,,,,
,862,Very Disappointed As We Had Been Looking Forward To My Partners Christmas Present Following A Previous Visit Which Was Lovely,,,,,,
,866,Just Keep E-Mailing Me About Offers  Dining Etc,,,,,,
,868,See Comment On Alcohol,,,,,,
,869,We Will Be Back For Sure  And Next Time We Will Tour The Palace!,,,,,,
,871,We Had A Very Enjoyable Christmas,,,,,,
,875,The Whole Team Made Our Stay Comfortable And Enjoyable.,,,,,,
,876,Room Service With The Teas And Coffees Was A Nice Touch And Very Efficient Service. Its A Shame That Our Expectations Weren't Met On So Many Levels As I Was Hoping And Wanting To Really Like The Feathers Hotel. It Was Meant As A Special Treat To My Wife  But Wasn't That Special.  I Think For The Kind Of Rate (I Paid £462 For The Room For Two Nights)  I Would Expect A Certain Level Of Service Alongside The Fabulous Furniture And Decor Of The Hotel - Unfortunately  The Service Didn't Meet The Standard Set By The Environment.,,,,,,
,877,The Receptionist Amended The Final Bill Quickly When An Item Had Been Added In Error. ,,,,,,
,879,Thank You,,,,,,
,882,Thank You For A Wonderful Stay. ,,,,,,
,884,We Were Sad That We Had Not Enjoyed Our Stay . We Were Looking Forward To Returning To The Feathers But It Failed In Our Expectations And Has Certainly Fallen Below Standard. We Noticed A Definite Difference From Previous Stays And Not For The Better. Unfortunately We Will Not Be Returning Unless There Is Improvement!,,,,,,
,889,The Food Was Remarkably Good. We Loved The Music On Nye  Though The Dance Floor Was Cramped And When It Was Vacated We Moved A Table.,,,,,,
,890,No,,,,,,
,891,No.,,,,,,
,892,I Think I Covered Everything. Many Thanks!,,,,,,
,893,I Think We'll Be Back But Perhaps Not Eat In The Hotel  Which We Generally Don't Normally Do Anyway. ,,,,,,
,894,Just To Say That 3 Drinks Had Been Added To Our Dining Bill That Wasn't Ours. Not A Major Error And It Was Sorted Out Very Quickly And Without Any Fuss.,,,,,,
,895,We Are Looking Forward To Our Next Stay.,,,,,,
,896,No,,,,,,
,898,We Were Delighted That We Could Bring Our Dog To The Hotel. It Was Also Terrific That He Could Be With Us While Dining  (In The Bar)  As It Could Have Been Difficult Leaving Him In The Room. Every Member Of Your Staff Was More Than Helpful In This Regard  Which Helped To Make Our Weekend At The Feathers A Delight. Thank You. ,,,,,,
,899,Look Forward To Returning,,,,,,
,900,At First I Hesitated To Book With You As You Were Offering A Two Night Stay For New Year Which We Couldn't Do  But I'm Glad It Was Possible To Reconfigure It Just For 31/12 It Suited Us And Was A Nice Change To See The New Year In With You.,,,,,,
,901,The Only Problem With The Account Was That A Bottle Of Champagne We Ordered Was Not On The Bill  But That Was Easily Remedied! ,,,,,,
,905,Asked For Our Night Caps At The Bar To Be Delivered To Our Suite. Bar Man Assured Us That Was Fine And Would Send Up. 45 Mins Later No Sign! Husband Went Downstairs To Find Said Bar Man Gone Home. So New Order Placed And Finally Received Over An Hour After Original Order.,,,,,,
,906,Discrepancy With The Bill But Soon Sorted Out.,,,,,,
,915,Keep Up The Great Work...,,,,,,
,918,The Hotel Is Meant To Be 4 Stars But Was Badly Let Down By A Large Number Of Small Errors. Each Time The Staff Were Apologetic And Tried To Put Things Right But This Number Of Mistakes Is Not Acceptable For A Hotel Of This Purported Standard  Hence Not Recommending It To Friends,,,,,,
,922,I Had Ordered Flowers For My Wife's Birthday - They Were In The Room On Arrival And Were Very Good. My Wife Particularly Appreciated The Card From The Manager. A Nice Personal Touch.,,,,,,
,925,No!,,,,,,
,927,Just To Thank You For A Most Enjoyable Stay,,,,,,
,928,Your Email 123 Offer Tempted Us To Return Again In February  Which We Probably Would Not Normally Do.,,,,,,
,929,If We Can Get A Last Minute Booking At That Sort Of Price We Would Be Interested,,,,,,
,930,A Pamphlet About The Gin Bar And Its History Would Have Been Interesting As Its So Unique.,,,,,,
,932,No,,,,,,
,933,I Booked The Gin O'clock Package And Was Told That I Would Get An Annual Pass To Blenheim Palace Sent To My Address (It Wasn't Open When We Visited). I Have Not Received It Yet Or Any Communication About It.,,,,,,
,938,No  Except That We Have Already Recommended The Feathers To Some Of Our Friends.,,,,,,
,943,No,,,,,,
,944,Shower Caps In The Bathroom Would Have Been Useful.,,,,,,
,947,No,,,,,,
,949,Wonderful Location For A Quiet Getaway,,,,,,
,957,Only Problem Was I Did Not Receive An Email To Confirm My Booking As Requested ,,,,,,
,964,We Consider The Lounge And Bar Areas Too Limited,,,,,,
,965,Thank You For Everything.,,,,,,
,968,Really Appreciated The Free Room Upgrade. Especially As Room We Enjoyed On Our Previous Stay. Most Considerate,,,,,,
