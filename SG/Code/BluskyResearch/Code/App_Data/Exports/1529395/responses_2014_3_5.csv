Also When I Booked The Hotel A Bottle Of Champagne Was Included In The Price  I Presumed That This May Have Been Left In The Room For Our Arrival Too  As It Had Not I Thought It May Have Been Brought To Us At Dinner. When The Waitress Took Our Orders I Had To Ask For The Champagne And Explained It Was Included In Our Package.

We Were Impressed With The Grandness Of The Hotel But Disappointed By A Cool Reception At Reception. We Asked If We Had A Nice Room As We Were There To Celebrate An Anniversary And Was Told 'Well You Will See In A Moment'. We Had A Room In The Road Which Was Very Noisey   As It Was Room 21 And We Were Celebrating 21 Years If Marriage Yesterday We Decided Not To Complain Or Be Moved  An Unfortunate Mistake On Our Part  We Were Both Wide Awake By Heavy Traffic Passing At 7 Am This Morning. The Room However Was Beautiful And Other Staff In The Bar And Restaurant Were Very Knowledgable ( With An Exception) And Very Eager To Be Attentive And Please  A Credit To The Establishment. We Had The Taster Menu In The Restaurant Which Was A Set Meal. I Would Advise That When There Is A Meat Course You Ask Your Guests How They Would Like Their Meat Cooking. We Wasn't Asked And When The Lamb Course Arrived It Was Practically Still Kicking. This Is Fine For Me As I Like My Meat On The Rare Side  It Was Infact Very Blue And Totally Put My Husband Off  He Couldn't Eat The Rest If His Meal Which Was A Shame As The Rest Was Beautiful. A Small But Easily Sorted Problem For Future Guests I Hope. Breakfast Was Delicious With The Same Attention To Detail So Thankyou. In Conclusion We Feel Disappointed That Such S Special Occasion Was Let Down By Small Issues (With The Exception Of The Lamb). I Wouldn't Usually Fill Out Feedback Requests But Felt You Would Find It Useful And Help Your Establishment Be Second To None And A Really Great Place To Stay.

There Was No Thermostat To Adjust The Temperature-We Were In Room 27 On The Third Floor. I Would Recommend Some Background Music In The Dining Room And Bar Areas As You Could Hear A Pin Drop In The Dining Room At Breakfast Time And Low Background Music Creates A Nice Ambience Where People Feel Comfortable To Talk Between Themselves.  On The First Evening We Ate In The Bar Area-The Menu Was Very Limited To 2 Startes And 2 Main Courses And 1 Desert. I Could Not Eat 3 Of The Dishes Due To The Contents And Been Pregnant. We Came For A Bar Meal At Lunchtime Last December 2012 And There Was Lots Of Choice And The Food Was Delicious  Hence Requesting To Return To The Talbot Hotel For Our Mini Break Prior To The Arrival Of Our First Child In December This Year. We Were Really Disappointed With The Selection Of Food Available In The Bar In The Evening And I Think The Hotel Is Really Missing A Treat With More Bistro/Informal Dining Which More People Want In Today's Busy World As Opposed To 3-5 Formal Courses In The Dining Room At Approx Â£50 Per Head.

I Asked Him To Take Our Order At 8.50  We Were Due To Sit Down At 9Pm. He Answered By Sarcasticly Saying 'Sorry I Thought I Had Another 10 Minutes. By Now I Felt Tearful. The Girls In The Dining Room Were Superb But I Had To Ask Them To Dim The Lights. There Were Wall Lights  Chandeliers And Candles. Restaurants Should Feel Romantic-But Thats Just My Opinion.

On Arrival (15:20) Having Travelled Some Distance To Attend An Evening Wedding Reception At The Talbot Our Party Were Looking Forward To Afternoon  Tea When I Enquired I Was Told By The Receptionist That The Wedding Ceremony (Which I Did Not Attend) Meant They Could Not Accommodate Us With Any Food At All!!! Having Not Eaten Since Breakfast We Were In Desperate Need Of At Least Tea/Coffee.  As There Is No Drinks Making Facility In The Rooms And As Directed By The Room Service Directory We Tried To Order Hit Drinks  Again Not Available!!! We Enquired After A Tea Room In Malton Upon Which We Were Given Voyage Can't Be Bothered Directions  We Wandered Around Malton And Eventually Found A Costa Coffee!!!. I Was Astounded To Find Myself In A Costs Coffee When I Was Resident In What You Describe In Your Website As A Luxury Hotel.  I Have Stayed At Other Hotels Where Drinks Making Facilities Are Not Available In Rooms (Usually A Sign Of Luxury And Superior Service) However I Have Never Ever Stayed In A Luxury (Even A Non Luxury Hotel) Where Food And Drink Are Not Available To Residents!!! Yes You Were Closed To The Public For The Wedding But If You Cannot Provide Facilities For Residents As Well As Host A Wedding I Think You Need To Rethink How You Promote Your Hotel And It's Facilities.  I Cannot Stress Enough How Not Being Able To Take Refreshment As A Resident Clouded My Whole Family Wedding Experience With You.  May I Recommend You Go Back To The Basics Of What Function A Hotel Is Supposed To Serve Before You Brand Yourself As Luxury.  I Have Declined To Have My Feedback Made Public Out Of Respect For My Family Who Chose To Hold Their Wedding Day With You.  I Couldn't Bear To Cloud Their Special Day With The Knowledge That Their Special Event Was Left Lacking By Your Poor Service.  ,Female,45-54,,,,,,,,Jacqui Taylor,... Please Select The Box

I Would Have Thought That It Would Be A Nice Gesture And Good Pr Practice To Offer To Remove From Our Final Bill The Charge For The Two Glasses Of Champagne/Prosecco We Had Had With Our Dinner The Night Before. Alas This Did Not Happen. However  She Did Suggest She Could Give Us A Bottle To Take With Us On Our Journey  Which We Declined.

However False It May Be Or Appear  There Is Nothing Wrong With Reception Staff Telling Us They're Really Pleased To See Us Or Be Dealing With Us. I've Only Recently Noticed That To Make A Hotel Or Restaurant Special  The Guest/Customer Needs To Feel As Though They Have Stepped Out Of The Everyday World Into Something Approaching A Different World. The Element Of Acting In The 'Delighted To See You' Welcome Actually Achieves This Effect. The Talbot Is Not There Yet. The Lad Taking Us Up To The Room  However  Was Spot On  Ie  Getting Out Of The Room Fast So As Not To Make Us Feel That He Was Angling For A Tip. Nice Touch  Accidental Or Not.,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,I Thought The Room Was Great. The Fixtures And Fittings  Going For Something Like An Edwardian Feel (Am I Right?) Were Well In Keeping With The Rest Of The Hotel  Which I Thought Was Great In Terms Of Furnishings In This Particular Historical Style. The Bathroom Was Fab  As Was The Bed. The Room Was One Of The Best Things About The Hotel - Very Impressive Work All Round. The Only Problem Was Being Woken Late At Night And Early In The Morning With Traffic Noise  The Road Being Right Outside The Window.,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Strongly Agree,Agree,Agree,Positively  The Lady With The Red Glasses And Chestnut Coloured Pony-Tail In The Dining Room When We Had Lunch On The Day Of Our Stay And Breakfast The Next Was Just The Sort Of Person I Like To Have Serving Me. She Was Informal But Not In A Bad Way. It's Notable That At Gordon Ramsay's Restaurant At Royal Hospital Road  His Three Michelin Star Establishment  Is Smart But Informal In Terms Of Atmosphere. I Thought That The Uniforms Of Those Waiting On Are Spot On: Smart And Professional Looking. However  The Younger Element Were Inclined To Be A Little Too Serious! The Red Glasses Lady Was Clearly Experienced  Which Is Great. Britain Is Plagued With Staff Who Are Too Young  Under-Paid And Under-Trained. I Was Very Pleased To See That The Talbot Is Making An Effort To Train The Staff 'Properly'. Overall The Staff Hit A Nice Balance Of Formal/Informal; It's Just That There's Room To Take It To An Even Higher Level.,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Exceeded,There's Always Something  Isn't There! Aside From The Comments Made Above  I'd Like To Comment On Lunch. After Jay Rayner's Outstanding Review Of James Martin's Outstanding Cooking At Dinner  We Were Eager To Eat Lunch. And While It Was Overall Very Good  I Have To Admit To Being A Little Underwhelmed With The Portion Size Of My Choices - Welsh Rarebit  Pot Chicken In Tarragon And Cream Sauce And Whisky Croissant Butter Pudding. This Was Especially In The Case Of The Pudding Where I Could Have Just About Put The Whole Lot In My Mouth In One Go! Whilst I Very Much Appreciate The Keenly Priced Menu  You Still Feel Sold A Little Short If There Doesn't Appear To Be Much On Your Plate. For The Record  The Rarebit Was Disappointing In Terms Of Flavour - The Cheese Was Much More Underpowered Than I'd Expected. That Said  It Still Tasted Good  As Did The Other Dishes. The Dessert Was Blindingly Good In Terms Of Taste. Again On The Positive Side  It Was Not Remotely The Case That My Wife's Portions Were Undersized - Not At All In Fact. The Parfait Should Have Had Twice The Amount Of Bread To Accompany It  But We Put That Right By Asking For More. The Waitress's Attitude Here Was Perfect.   One More Comment In 'Could Do Better' Mode. If You Want To Take The Bar 'Experience' Up A Notch  Put Some More Local Beers On Via Pump And Have A Wheat Beer On Tap Too. In Terms Of Decor  I'm Not Sure It Matches The Lounge  The Hallway And The Rooms. Two More! Coffee After Dinner. My Wife Ordered A Double Espresso And She Didn't Think Much Of The Flavour. We Like Our Coffee  Go To Italy A Fair Amount And Know What Good Coffee Tastes Like  And I Trust Her Palette. Surely  If The Talbot Is A Truly Aspirational Modern/Traditional Hotel It Should Serve Excellent Coffee All Round. My Cafetiere Was Fine  As It Was The Next Morning At Breakfast  But It Wasn't Exceptional. It Was As Good As It Needed To Be And No More. Three! Talking About Breakfast Reminds Me About The Toast. Why Is B And B And Hotel Toast So Mediocre?! Usually  It Comes Too Soon And It's Underdone. Here  It Came Too Soon And Half Of It Was Underdone! The Other Half Was Overdone!!!! How Can It Be So Difficult To Serve Toast That's Done To A Turn? Heaven Knows You Churn The Stuff Out Every Day - Can't You Get Your Machines On The Right Settings And Keep Them There? Honestly!  ,Can I Now Comment On More Things I Liked? The Late Bar Was Great And My Cognac Delightful And At A Good Price. Indeed  The Range Of Spirits On Offer Was Impressive And Set Out Beautifully On The Menu. The Food Overall Was Really Good In Terms Of Flavour And Ingredients. My Fried Plate Was Lovely - Delicious Ingredients Well Cooked - And The Buffet Spread Impressive.   What I Most Enjoyed About The Hotel Was The Relaxed Feel To The Place  The Lounge With A Nice Range Of Sunday Papers And The Traditional 1900-20 Decor And Furniture. I'm A Staunch Labour Voter But I Didn't Feel Myself To Be In The Grip Of Complaisant  Pompous  Tory Yorkshire. Well Done  Those Responsible For Making Me Feel Like That!  Looking Forward To Returning Soon  Keep Up The Economy Offers!  Best Regards   Craig Thomas 19 The Hollins Holloway Derbyshire De45ba,Male,55-64,Rooms & Suites,Food & Drink,,,,Offers,,Thomas,

There Is Little Point Completing A Survey If It Is Not Frank So My Comments Are Considered And Honest And I Would Not Mind Discussing. The Main ÂEnhancementâ Could Be Staff Behaviour. Communicating Skills And Warmth Seemed To Me Lacking And I Am Not Difficult To Please.  Despite Being A Very Busy Person I Frequently Take The Time (Even Without It Being Part Of A Survey) To Write In To Express My Appreciation  To Praise Service And Particular Members Of Staff And  More Rarely  To Complain. On This Occasion There Was Nothing Outstanding And I Genuinely Felt That  Whilst There Might Be Total Commitment To The 'Job'  There Was A General Lack Of Spark Or Care To The Clients. No-One Was Impolite And I Can Honestly Say I Prefer Not To Have The Greetings That Trip Off The Tongue  But Something Was Definitely Missing! ,We Were Intending To Eat In The Hotel But Were Disappointed With The Offer Of The Single Vegetarian Option Of Butternut Squash Rissotto That (Even Though This Was Probably Superb) Is A Dish That Many Restaurants Offer!  We Dined Out At The New Malton Which Was Highly Recommended To Us And Had The Choice Of Three Unique  Imaginative & Well Prepared Meals.  Between Us We Sampled Them All Over The Two Nights And They Were Simply Stunning In Presentation And Taste.  Additionally We Were Offered Something Specially Prepared If The Menu Was Not To Our Liking And We Gave A Little Notice.

This Lack Of Change To The Menu Would Be The Principal Reason Why We Will Probably Not Return To The Talbot Hotel.  Other Hotels In Which We Have Stayed Have Adopted A Much More Flexible And Attractive Menu.  There Also Appeared To Be Absolutely Nothing On The Menu That Would Have Been Suitable For Any Children.

Thereafter  After Being Advised That There Was No Room In The Restuarant (Despite The Restaurant Not Seeming Busy  And The Restaurant Manager's List Showing No More Than 10 Pax At Any One Time In The Evening) We Went To The Local Restaurant  'The New Malton' Where The Food Was Excellent  The Prices Lower Than The Talbot  And The Service Was Accomodating And Welcoming. We Visit The Malaton Area Regularly On Business And Will Have To Consider Carefully If We Wish To Stay At A Hotel Where The Dining Experience Is So Disappointing. The Impression We Got Was That The Restaurant Is Managed Principally For The Benefit Of The Local Population And Not Your Paying Residents - Sooner Or Later This Approach Must Surely Damage Your Hotel Trade And Your Reputation.  ,,,55-64,,,,,,,,David & Beverley Aspinall,

I Took The Time To Telephone Before Our Arrival And Explain This As The Only Food Fad We Have.  Unfortunately The First Course Of The Tasting Menu Was Goat Cheese.  It Was Not Described As Goat Cheese On The Tasting Menu.  I Was Made Aware Of The Problem As We Were Initially Given The A La Carte Menu By Mistake And I Spotted The Dish Which Was Fully Described On That Menu.  As A Result I Brought It To The Attention Of Our Waitress Who Made Arrangements For Us To Have The Smoked Salmon Starter Instead.  The Matter Was Dealt With Very Efficiently And In A Friendly And Light Hearted Manner Which Allowed Us To Remain Comfortable.  It Was  After All  My Wife's Birthday  And The Stay With You Was Her Treat.  Had One Of Us Actually Suffered From An Allergy To The Offending Item The Evening Could Have Become Very Unpleasant.

There Should Either Be A Notion My Bill Or These Should Have Been Provided Upon Arrival. The Quantity Of Waste In Hotels Is Tragic. The Majority Of Guests Will Understand If Measures Are Taken To Reduce Waste To Ensure Your Activities Are Sustainable. For Example Stop Using Individual Pots Of Jam And Honey But Use Reusable And Smaller Dishes. At Least Three Quarters Of My Honey Wasn't Used.

In Fact We Had Five Courses And Glasses. Also No Menu  No Explanation So We Seem To Have Missed Two Courses/Glasses.

We Had A Drink In The Bar Beforehand.  Outside The Bar On A Table Were Dishes Of Olives And Nuts.  No-One In The Bar Was Offered Or Given These - So Not Really Sure What They Were For.  When We Came Back Into The Bar After Our Meal  The Tray Full Of Olives And Nuts Were Still There.  The Service In The Restaurant Wasn't Particularly Attentive.  At The End Of The Meal  Our Dessert Plates Were Left; No-One Offered Us Coffee Or An After Dinner Drink Or Asked Us If Everything Was Ok.  Eventually  After About 20 Minutes Waiting  We Left The Restaurant And No-One Acknowledged Us Leaving.  It Was A Bit Disappointing  Particularly As It Very Obviously Wasn't The Treatment Everyone In The Restaurant Was Receiving.

A Great Atmosphere Of Ease Pervades The Talbot.  Nothing Apparently Too Much Trouble For Staff - Who Give Attentive Yet Unobtrusive Service. We Have Lunched Several Times At The Talbot. This Was The First Overnight Stay. Very Comfortable Rooms  Excellent Wifi And Quality Bathrooms. Would Only Say We Have Noticed An Increasing Tendency With The Menu To Get 'Over-Interesting/Eclectic' So That A Bit Limited Dinner Menu Choice For Those For Who Do Not Like Game Or Birds Or Beef Cheek  Especially Given The Chef's Style Of Cooking A Point Or  For Our Taste  A Bit Underdone.

The Chairs Have Quite A Lean Back And Are Much More Comfortable With A Cushion. But Overall We Much Enjoyed The Dinner. Again Am Only Wishing To Give Constructive Feedback As We Like The Talbot So Much. It's Just That We Think The Menu Could Do With A Little Tweaking So As To Offer A More Balanced Choice For The Presumably Wide Range/Different Types Of Guests You Have/Wish To Attract.

The Food Was Fantastic And Faultless But The Service We Thought In The Restaurant Was Average.  Although We Were Having The Gourmet Experience  With Wine Flight  3 Of Our First 4 Wines  Did Not Arrive Before Our Food And We Had To Request And Wait For The Wine.  The First Member Of Staff Apologised And Brought The Wine  The Second Member Of Staff Was Going To Bring Over The Wine List And In The Final Instance  The Restaurant Manager  Apologised And Brought Us A Complimentary Glass Of Champagne Each At The End Of The Meal.  Also  The Restaurant Manager Was The Only Person Who Described What The Wine Was.  The Other Staff Either Just Put It Down In Front Of Us (Late) And When We Did Ask What Wine It Was  No Description Was Given. We Have Done Wine Flights Before And Best Part Is The Drama In Understanding The Wines And How They Compliment The Food.  Aside From The Restaurant Manager No-One Managed To Achieve This.

Whilst The Restaurant Was Pleasant Enough We Felt The Ambience Could Be Worked Upon. For The Aim Of The Hotel  Which I Believe To Be Boutique With Fine Dining Experience We Felt That The Service Failed To Deliver On Many Levels.     For Instance Initially I Liked The Idea That Tea And Coffee Facilities Were Not Available In The Room  But That Presumably Better Quality Refreshment Could Be Obtained By Ringing Reception.  This Service Failed To Impress When We Ordered Coffee  Which Did Not Arrive  And When Two Hours Later I Called Reception To Enquire About Its Whereabouts It Took Me Five Attempts Where The Phone Rang Out To Get Through To Reception.  I Am Pleased To Report That The Coffee Ordered The Following Morning Arrived Promptly.,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree,,Strongly Agree,Disagree,Agree,Room 3. The Shower Door Leaked Badly And You Could Not Turn The Shower On Without Getting Soaked Because The Door Was Installed To Open By The Shower Head  Not By The Controls.  Whilst There Was Not A Good Selection Of Products In My Bathroom  The Quality Was Excellent.,Yes,Restaurant,,,,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,My Husband And I Chose The James Martin Tasting Menu  With Wine.  We Found The Food Quality Very Good  And Particularly Enjoyed The Goat's Cheese Mousse And The Pork  And Thought That The Wines Were Excellently Paired With The Food.  We Were Both Extremely Disappointed By The Smoked White Chocolate Ganache  Which Neither Of Us Ate More Than A Mouthful Of.  This Was In The Main Because It Was So Heavily Smoked That When The Waiter Placed It In Front Of Me  My Initial Thought Was That He Had In Fact Recently Been For A Cigarette.  This May Just Have Been Our Palates  However What Surprised Me Most Was That No One On The Waiting Staff Enquired As To Why Both Of Us Had Barely Touched It.  In General We Both Found The Restaurant Service Poor  For The Fine Dining Aim And Price Point (In North Yorkshire).  To Deliver At This Level The Service Is Paramount  And I Have Bored Many Friends With Tales Of Excellent Service In Other Establishments That I Have Eaten  I Am Afraid That This Will Not Be Happening For The Talbot.  Our First Course Was Delivered Beautifully - We Were Told About The Wine That Had Been Paired With Our Food  And It Arrived Shortly Before The Food  Which Was Also Described To Us On Delivery.  Our Fish Course Wine Was Delivered Before The Food  But Without Comment  And Our Food Was Also Delivered Without Comment.  I Found Myself Wishing That I Had Memorised The Menu  Or That Someone Would Bring It To Me So I Could Remember The Detail - Because When You Order A Tasting Menu You Do Not Memorise Everything That You Have Ordered Because You Have Ordered An Experience That The Chef Has Designed  Which May Not Be Dishes You Would Normally Choose.  Our Meat And Fourth Courses Arrived Before The Accompanying Wines  Reducing Us To Waiting Until The Maitre'd Noticed And Had Them Served To Us So That We Could Enjoy With Our Course.  Our Dessert Wine Arrived So Far Before The Dessert We Actually Thought That It Had Been Forgotten.  After The First Course And Wine All Items Were Served To Us Politely  But Without Comment.  Not Once Did Anyone Ask If We Had Enjoyed Our Food.  Everyone Was Very Friendly  And Polite  But The Service Was So Far Away From The Polish That I Would Expect From A Meal Costing £160 For Two In North Yorkshire As To Be Extremely Disappointing.    The Following Day We Had Lunch In The Crab And Lobster In Asenby Near Thirsk And The Experience And Professionalism Of The Staff There Was Stark In Contrast To That At The Talbot  Despite The Fact That We Did Not Have A Restaurant Reservation And Ate Only In The Bar.  I Noted On Leaving That There Was A Country Life Article In A Frame Near The Reception Christmas Tree  Declaring The Talbot To Be One Of The Top Ten Restaurants With Rooms In The Country To Stay Whilst Enjoying Country Sport - I Am Not Familiar With The Quality Of The Shooting In The Area But I Imagine It Is Excellent  I Am Afraid That The Quality Of Service Is Unlikely To Impress That Particular Range Of Clientele  And Indeed I Would Not Expect An Establishment Such As The Talbot To Be Displaying Cut Out Magazine Articles Declaring It To Be One Of The Best In Reception - Surely  If You Are Staying There Already - You Don't Need To Be Told This?,,,,,,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,No,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Agree,Fell Below,,,Female,35-44,,,,,,,,Miles & Helen Smurthwaite,

No Staff Were Around To Ask  I Had To Go Looking Into The Hall To Find One. When I Said That I Expected 'Treats' I Was Told That Treats Were Only Served In The Evening.

Week In Bed On High Dose Morphine  Only Been On My Feet A Few Days I Was Initially Shocked When Found Out No Lift ! Your Lady On The Desk Did However Change Our Room On Arrival To The Suite ( 4 Poster) Pictured Above  So I Only Had 1 Flight Of Stairs Which My Husband Assisted Me With. The 2/3 Steps After This Do Need Some Sort Of Rail On At Least On Side Though As I Had Nothing But My Husband To Hold ! Other Than That I Found The Room To Be A Delight  And Was Very Grateful For The Upgrade Under The Circumstances. Everything Else Was Very Accessible To Me Including The Large Walk In Shower ( A Must For Me). The Hotel Was Very Cozy And Had A Nice Atmosphere. The Staff Went Out Of Their Way To Make Ours And Everyone Else's Stay By The Look A Pleasure. ( As It Was Only The 2Nd Time My Husband And I Have Stayed Away Without The 2 Children In Last 5 Years It Was Lovely To Feel Looked After)  They Usually Come With Us Everywhere. The Tasting Menu Which Was Part Of Our Groupon Voucher Deal We Purchased Back In November 2013 Was In Most Parts Very Nice. Personal Taste  But I Was Rather Looking Forward To Dessert And Didn't Like The Smoked White Choc. Granache At All  My Husband Was So So  We Have A Wide Tasting Palate  This Just Wasn't Really For Us  And I Left Mine  So Made Do With The Petit Fours And Coffee By The Fire In The Drawing Room. Service In The Restaurant Was Generally Prompt  We May Have Slowed Down Dessert Poss. As We Were Chatting To Your Staff !  Rest Of It Was Very Prompt!. Despite The Weather Being Awful On The Saturday Meaning We Didn't Go Into Malton  We Relaxed Around The Hotel From 3Pm Ish Onwards  We Had A Lovely Stay ( Everywhere Shut On The Sunday Of Course When Weather Much Nicer). All Staff Were Delightful And A Credit To The Hotel. Breakfast Was Served Timely  And Was Beautiful  Not Fatty At All And Perfect Size.
Any Recommendations I Could Make ;- Even If Small....1. An Orchid Was In Our Room On The Fireplace In A Plastic Container As They Are Bought  Would Have Looked Much Better In A Plant Pot !!
2. Just Fyi ( Not A Bother To Us) There Are A Lot Of Ladybirds I Think Living In The Wood Of The Windows In The Bay Of The Room We Stayed In  We Noticed Sunday Morning When We Tried To Let Some Air In. Sadly We Could Not Open The Right Side Bay Window ( Painted Shut ?/ Stuck) So I Had To Shoot A Photo Through The Glass Of The View.
3. I Appreciate It Was A Pre Decided Tasting Menu But It Would Have Been Nice To Have Been Offered An Alternate Choice Of Dessert. I Have Never Had Choc. Granache Smoked Before ! Nor Will Again .
4. Extra Towels In The Bathroom  Are Always Welcome  I Don't Like To Have To Trouble People Ringing Up For These Things. Perhaps This Is Just From Stays At Other Hotels  But A Pair Of Dressing Gowns In The Bathroom Of A Suite Of This Calibre Always Is A Welcome Addition. The Fireplace In The Bedroom/Suite Made A Lovely Addition  But The One In The Bathroom Was Of Most Character  With The Other One Being Boarded Up. I Think This And The Up-Potted Lilly Drew My Eye To It. The Screen In Front Of It Was Beautiful  But A Larger One To Cover Up More Of The Cream Boarding Would Perhaps Be More Suitable/ Attractive.  Also  I Do Have Long Hair And Had Forgot My Own Shampoo  We Made Do With The 1 In The Room  But Perhaps Leaving 2 Might Seem A Little More Generous. I Was Past The Point Of Ringing Down When I Realized.! All In All  These Remarks Are Small In Comparison With The Fantastic Stay We Had With You. I Do Have A Flickr Account Where I Post Shots I Take ( A Hobby Of Mine)  And I Do Write Reviews For Trip Adviser To Help Other Travellers Make An Informed Choice. I Hope You Find This Info. Useful  It In No Way Spoilt Our Stay  But Please If Your Grade Ii Listing Allows Could You Put A Small Handrail On The Small Steps Up To The Room.

( Suite In Photo Above),Yes,Restaurant,,,,Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Tasting Menu Whilst Good Value For Us And Very Nice  - I Would Not Choose Again As I Did Not Like The Dessert At All And Had Been Really Looking Forward To It. 
We Did Order A Side Of Hand Cooked Chips Which Were Delicious Between Us  To Go With The Pork Main Course. Personally I Think It Needed It  As Did My Husband. 
Good Choice Of Non-Alcoholic Drinks Such As Fentimens And Bottle Green   May I Also Rec. Belvoir Too. I Have Not 'Drank' In Over 2 Years As I Live On Morphine To Control My Back Pain And It Is Def. A No No !! I Did Not Ask For Any Other Drinks So Not Sure Re. You Beers  But I Personally Rec. Becks Blue As Best On The Market. I Think This Is Good Not Only For Non-Drinkers Like Me For Medical Reasons  But Also People Driving Home  Mum's Breastfeeding Their Babies Etc And These Drinks Are Very Popular With 30-45 Years Old Group That I Fit Into Along With A High Number Of My Friends Who Drink Them. The Rose Lemonade Is Also An Interesting And Pleasant Choice  As Is Straight Elderflower Presse.  ( Perhaps Your Rep. Could Do You A Sampling !) ( M And S So A Wonderful Apple And Mirabelle Presse  But I Don't Suppose That Is Easily Sourced By Yourselves !)
We Came As A Couple So Made Perfect Venue For Us In Terms Of Size.,,,,,,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,I Am Sorry To Say I Am Dreadful At Remembering People's Names ! The Lady Who Checked Us In / Out At The Desk Was Lovely And Very Helpful When Realized My Needs ( Re Stairs ).

There Was A Lack Of Balance In The Wines With The Pinot Noir Being Particularly Unwelcome. The Wreck Fish Had Bones In  Two To Be Precise. The Staff Are Very Pleasant  However I Would Trade A Little Pleasantness For A Little More Professionalism  There Were Four Of Us Eating The Same Meal And Not On Any Single Course Did Plates Come Toghether There Was Always One Waiting And To Compound That It Was Always The Females On The Table Left Waiting (Why Not Two Waiters?)
