There Was No Hot Water Only Cold.   A Really Awful Experience.  Especially As I Stayed In Another Hotel On The 2Nd Night Where The Room Was Very Big And Luxurious And Cost The Same Price.  The Breakfast In The Hotel Had More Choice Than 5 Arrows And Cooked Much Better.  It Is A Shame Because I Felt Disgruntled And Cheated By The Size Of My Room At 5 Arrows And The Fact I Felt I Had Been Conned By Not Being Warned About The Size And So I Could Have Made A Decision   I Had No Idea It Would Be So Small And Unaccommodating.  As A Result Of This Experience I Wouldn't Recommend The Hotel To Other People Because They May Have The Same Experience.,Yes,,,,Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Strongly Disagree,I Had An Evening Meal With A Colleague Who Was Staying In The Hotel.  The Food Was Ok  The Starter Of Chicken Parfait Was Nice  The Fish Was Acceptable.  However  I Certainly Didn't Feel It Was Exceptional Or Even Memorable - It Served A Function.,,,,,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,,Strongly Disagree,,Fell Below,1) Told Me About The Size Of Room And Given Me An Option 2) A Member Of Staff Had Suggested That I Might 'Twin Up' With My Colleague Who I Work With. Thank Goodness My Colleague Didn't Want To Do This  Because I Think It Would Have Been An Awful Experience  3) The Small Room Was So Small - But It Was The Fact The Shower Didn't Work Properly  The Sink Is Useless And There Was No Hot Water.,Unfortunately I Also Have A Complaint About The Breakfast.  We Asked For Boiled Eggs And They Were Not Cooked Well.  The Orders Were Mixed Up -  I Asked For A Well Done Egg And My Colleague A Soft Egg.  But Both Eggs Were Tasteless And Not Cooked Well.   So Unfortunately The Experience Was Not Good.    Because I Stayed In A Different Hotel On The 2Nd Night The Breakfast In The 2Nd Hotel  Was Fresh   A Well Cooked English Breakfast  Fruit  Yogurt  Good Service  Etc.   And Again All For The Same Price.  So It Made The 5 Arrows Look Less Competitive.  I Wonder Whether There Is Complacency On The Part Of 5 Arrows Because Of Repeat Business/Local Trade Because It Certainly Did Not Deserve Any Positive Feedback For The Room (I Stayed In A Single At The Top Of The Hotel No: 7?)   It Was Appalling And The Food Wasn't Too Great Either.,Female,55-64,,,,,,,,,

The Food Was Well Prepared And Carefully Presented And We Found It Both Tasty And Hearty  With Generous Portions. The Wine List Was Interesting And Gave Diners The Opportunity To Drink Rothchild Wines In Surroundings That Have A Rothchild Connection. However  We Also Thought That The Quality Of The Dining Furniture And Lounge Area Were Rather Ordinary. Tables Seem To Be Stained Chipboard  And The Modern Furniture In The Bar Area Lacked Character. Also The Bar Area Felt More Like A Hallway Or Service Area Than A Dedicated Place Of Hospitality. I Would Say This Is Due To The Functional  Rather Than Inviting Lighting  The Drafts And Changes In Temperature From The Entrance Door Being Used  And The Fact That The Area Is Used For Different Functions - Reception  Thoroughfare For Dining Service And Bar.,,,,,Agree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,Neither Agree Nor Disagree,,Agree,Strongly Agree,Met,We Enjoyed Our Stay  Thank You.
