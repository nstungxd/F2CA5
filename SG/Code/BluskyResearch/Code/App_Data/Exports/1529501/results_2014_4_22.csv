,333,Always A Pleasure.  Was Given A Warm Welcome And Had A Great Stay.  Even Had Breakfast Next To "Alex Salmond" The Next Morning! - Very Sad You Are Closing Next Year !,,,,,,
,334,It Was Good.  The Room Was Very Comfortable And Well Equipped (If A Bit Traditional For My Taste).  The Food Was Also Good.  And The Service.  The Meeting Room Was A Bit Crowded (Low Ceiling In The Corner)  And The Wcs Were A Bit Too Few "And Far Between".  Circulation Around The Lounge And Dining Room Is A Bit Difficult.,,,,,,
,335,Perfect.  We Were Engaged And Married At The Marcliffe  And It Is With Great Sadness That This Was (In All Likelihood) Our Final Stay. This Final Stay Was To Celebrate Our Engagement Anniversary And We Are Out Of The Country For Our Wedding Anniversary  Otherwise We May Have Stayed Again. It Is Truly A Shame To See Such A Wonderful Place Close  And We Will Take Many Happy Memories Away From It. ,,,,,,
,336,Fantastic  A True Scottish Gem.,,,,,,
,337,One Of The Best Hotels That I Stay At  Not Just In Aberdeen But World-Wide,,,,,,
,338,Food Great  Lounge Area Lovely As With All The Staff  Bathrooms Looking Tired But Overall Great Facility  It Will Be A Loss To Aberdeen When It Closes Next Year ,,,,,,
,339,Excellent,,,,,,
,342,Room & Food Excellent. Disappointed By Party Night Entertainment!,,,,,,
,343,Marcliffe Is My Favourite Hotel. Yes There Are More Luxurious Places  But Marcliffe Has The Atmosphere That Comforts Me. I Regret Deeply That The Hotel Is To Close Down. ,,,,,,
,344,It Made A Special Occasion Extra Special.,,,,,,
,345,First Class,,,,,,
,346,To Answer The Above Questions I'd Need To Answer Them Separately For The Hotel And The Spa.  We Thought The Hotel Was Wonderful...Fantastic  Friendly Service And Beautiful Surroundings.  We Would Definitely Like To Come Back To The Hotel And Would Recommend It To Our Friends.  However  Our Experience Of The Spa Was Very Different.  We Had Been Expecting A High Quality Experience In The Spa But This Was Unfortunately Not The Case.  We Booked 2 Treatments Each Over The 2 Days We Stayed.  My First Treatment Was Fine Althought The Room Was Very Cold And The Bed Was Not Warmed For My Treatment As I Would Have Expected.  The Therapist Also Failed To Ask If I Was Comfortable With The Temperature Of The Room.  I Had To Ask For An Extra Towel Because I Was Cold.  However  It Was Our Second Visit On Sunday 8Th Dec Which Disappointed  And Shocked  Us The Most.  While Waiting In The Waiting Area For Our Therapists  We Overheard The Therapists Talking About A Client.  One Of The Therapists Could Be Heard Saying: "I Know  She Is The Worst Client Ever.  I Feel Like Telling Her : ' Shut Up You Little Shit!'"  As You Can Imagine  My Husband And I Were Horrified And Shocked....So Shocked In Fact That We Said Nothing About It And Continued With Our Treatments....The Whole Time Wondering If We Would Be Spoken About When We Left.  We Didn't Say Anything At The Time As We Felt It Would Ruin Our Weekend...But As It Turns Out  It Ruined Our Weekend Anyway.  Whenever We Look Back On Our Weekend Away  It Is This Incident We Remember And It Makes Us Feel Very Angry  Upset And Disappointed.  Not What We Had Expected When We Booked A Much Looked Forward To Break For A Very Special Occasion At The Marcliffe.  I Know That You  As Manager  Would Also Want To Know About This Incident As It Is Not What Anyone Would Expect When Visiting The Spa At The Marcliffe.  Many Thanks  Lynne Wilson. ,,,,,,
,347,Relaxed And Enjoyable Expereince,,,,,,
,348,Fantastic.  Everything Was Excellent And It's A Pity That Something As Wonderful As This Is Being Closed In 2014.  There Is Nothing Else Like It In Aberdeen To Take It's Place.,,,,,,
,349,Excellent Stay As Always. I Was Staying For The Craig Group's 80Th Anniversary Celebrations And Must Say How Good The Food And Atmosphere Was For The Evening.,,,,,,
,351,Brilliant Place To Hold A Large Wedding. Rather Expensive Rooms And Drinks At The Wedding Were Expensive. Shame It Is To Be Knocked Down After It Closes In November.,,,,,,
,352,Excellent Service  Food And Accommodation. A Truly Wonderful Experience.,,,,,,
,353,I Could Not Fault The Facilities. The Suite  Although More Expensive Than Other Rooms Was Luxurious And Fulfilled Our Needs. The Staff Was Very Friendly And Most Helpful.,,,,,,
,354,Top Class Service And Quality Food  Value For Money,,,,,,
,355,Great Stay.,,,,,,
,357,Outstanding,,,,,,
,358,It Was A Great Experience The Rooms Were Well Equipped And Well Set Out,,,,,,
,361,Had A Lovely Post Chritmas Break With My Husband  Dinner  Breakfast And Spa Treatment And I Could Not Fault The Service  Attention To Detail - Its A Real Shame That This Great Hotel Is Likely To Close - I Hope It Doesn't.,,,,,,
,362,The Whole Experience Was Fabulous  Excellent Staff And Service Nothing Was Too Much Trouble. We Were Given A Complimentary Room Upgrade. I Booked This As A Treat For My Partner Bruce's Birthday And Could Not Fault Anything  I Also Booked Him A Spa Treatment Which He Thoroughly Enjoyed And Said It Was So Relaxing. We Also Ate In The Restaurant  The Service And Food Was Superb. It Is Such A Shame That Such A Beautiful Hotel With Excellent Service In All Areas Is Going To Close In November. However We Will Certainly Be Staying Again Before Closure  And Would Like To Thank You All For The Wonderful Time We Had. ,,,,,,
,363,Excellent - First Class ,,,,,,
,364,Overall A Good Experience  Although Breakfast Finishes Quite Early At 10.30  Likewise Room Checkout Is Quite Early At 10.30 Too. I Had Also Asked For A Postcard To Be Posted And It Has Never Reached Its Destination.,,,,,,
,365,We Took The Opportunity To Stay After Attending The Fairfield Energy Dinner Dance.  We Live Less Than A 5 Minute Walk To The Hotel.  As New Comers To Aberdeen  Many People Have Commented On The Standards Of Your Hotel.  It Would Have Been An Opportunity Missed Not To Have Stayed Whilst In Aberdeen.  We Are Familair With Hotels Of A High Standard And Would Rate Your Hotel Up There.  We Look For An Opportunity To Return For Afternoon Drinks And Food When We Next Get A Babysitter!,,,,,,
,366,No Complaints.  Everyone On Hand To Make Our Stay As Easy And Pleasant As Possible.  Attended A Wedding Which Was Just Perfect.,,,,,,
,367,Absolutely Marvellous. My First Stay At Your Hotel And You Kindly Upgraded My Room As I'd Just Joined The Loyalty Scheme. One Of Your Bar Staff Kindly Recommended A Lebanese Wine Which Was Very Nice Too. Could You Send Me The Name Of It? Shame You're Closing!,,,,,,
,368,Marvellous. My First Stay And You Kindly Upgraded My Room As I Had Just Joined The Loyalty Scheme. Shame You're Closing.,,,,,,
,369,As We Live In Edinburgh Being Invited To A Wedding Gave Us The Opportunity To Come So We Decided To Come For The Weekend And Loved Every Minute Of Our Stay.  The Ambiance Was Lovely.  All The Staff Were So Welcoming And The Food Was First Class. My Only Regret Is That I Never Came Sooner And We Are Sorry It Is To Close.  That Is The Only Reason For The "Maybe" Above.,,,,,,
,370,My Husband & I Stayed On A Dinner  Bed & Breakfast Package For His 40Th Birthday And We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Meals & Stay! ,,,,,,
,371,Excellent Customer Service. ,,,,,,
,372,Always Has A Relaxed But Professional Feeling About The Hotel.  Food Is Amazing And Good Sleep Quaility Too.,,,,,,
,373,Excellent Quality And A Relaxed Atmosphere,,,,,,
,374,Excellent! Staff Were Extremely Friendly And Helpful Both In The Hotel And Spa! Our Room Was Great And The Food Was Superb - Brilliant Weekend  Many Thanks!,,,,,,
,375,The Service Is Excellent And The Food Was Delicious!  We Also Enjoyed The Lovely Lounge Area You Have. ,,,,,,
,376,Excellent Service And Accommodations  Wonderful Food. Very Sad To Hear It Will Be Closing  Such A Loss For Aberdeen. ,,,,,,
,377,Very Comfortable Stay  Very Friendly And Efficient Staff,,,,,,
,378,Superb !!!!  Please Don't Close,,,,,,
,379,Very Professional Staff  Lovely Room And Made To Feel " Nothing Was Too Much Trouble" ,,,,,,
,380,Fantastic. The Room - Dunnoter Suite And The Meal Was Brilliant As Always. Service Great  And Always Nice To See The Same Staff Every Time We Return. Very Disappointed That The Marcliffe Is Closing At The End Of The Year.,,,,,,
,381,Had A Great Time And Well Looked After By All Staff,,,,,,
,386,Just The Best !  So Sad That You Are Closing So Will Have To Book Another Stay Before That Happens,,,,,,
,387,Brilliant But We Won't Be Back Before It Closes In November. One Down Point Was Breakfast With Abysmal. No Staff Till After 8Am,,,,,,
,389,Lovely Experience Except The Unbelievably Rude And Obnoxious Behaviour By Stewart Spence Towards Me In The Restaurant At Dinner - He May Have Served Blue Steaks For X Number Of Years But I Have Eaten Them For Over 30 Years And Know Exactly What They Should Be. Totally Unacceptable Behaviour Towards A Guest.,,,,,,
,390,Fantastic
,,,,,,
,391,Very Pleasant   Helpful Staff. Am Glad To Be Able To Say That We Have Stayed In The Marcliffe Before It Closes For Business Later On In The Year. ,,,,,,
,392,Room Was Lovely  Great Food And Service. However  The Noise Level Of Other Guests  Who Had A Private Party Right Next To Our Bedroom  In The Garden Room  Slightly Spoiled Our Wedding Night. Having Chosen Executive Room For Our Wedding Night  We Expected Some Privacy  Not Drunk People Shouting In Front Of Our Room. ,,,,,,
,394,My Wife And I Had Our Wedding Reception  Our Daughters Christening  Parents Birthday Meals - And Several Other Special Events All At The Marcliffe And We Have Always Had A Memorable And Enjoyable Time. The Staff Are Always Excellent And The Food Is Consistently First Class And Can't Be Beaten In My Opinion. I Travel Frequently With My Work But Have Yet To Find Anywhere On A Par With The Marcliffe. ,,,,,,
,395,From Checking In Through To Dinner We Were Looked After Very Well.  The Marcliffe Has That Special Ambience And Is Very Relaxing.,,,,,,
,396,As Always From Visiting The Marcliffe For Functions New Year Bashes Etc We Had An Excellent Stay And All The Staff Were Very Helpful. One Point There Was No Hot Water In The Castle Of Mey Room In The Morning. Forgot To Mention To Reception.,,,,,,
,397,Excellent Experience.  ,,,,,,
,399,Booking Efficient And Welcoming. The Entrance Area Is A Highlight And As If Entering A Home. Staff Are All Great. We Engaged With Stephanie On Reception Who Is Proactive And Interested In The Guests Welfare. I Hope Her Potential Is Developed In The Future. Iain Milne Owns His Role. The Fish At Dinner Was Brilliant. Pure White And Well Cooked. We Will Return.,,,,,,
,401,Very Pleasant & Very Enjoyable,,,,,,
,404,Friendly Staff (Especially The Breakfast Crew).  There's Something Refreshing About Being Serenaded By The Old Mother Who Serves The Tea And Coffee At The 6:30Am Breakfast.,,,,,,
,405,We Came Back To The Hotel To Celebrate Our Anniversary  We Got Married At The Hotel 8 Years Ago. Our Room Was Excellent  The Staff  Waiting  Bar  And Reception Were Excellent...Had A Wonderful Weekend There..,,,,,,
,407,Overall This Was The Least Enjoyable Stay I Have Had In The Marcliffe Which Is Disapointing. The Showers Changed Temperature From Normal To Very Hot  To Very Cold On Their On Which Is A Safety Issue.,,,,,,
,408,A Very Relaxing Tranquil Break With Time To Experience The Finer Things In Life.,,,,,,
,410,Very Good Quiet Relation,,,,,,
,411,Friendly  Helpful.  Food And Service Excellent.  A Deserving 5 Star Hotel.,,,,,,
,412,We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Wedding Reception And Our Room Was Well Appointed With Everything We Could Ask Of An Overnight Stay. Our Breakfast Was Excellent And The Staff Were All Friendly And Attentive Throughout. We Left Feeling Relaxed And Rested With A Hassle Free Check Out Service. Thank You,,,,,,
,413,Homely And Welcoming,,,,,,
,414,The Marcliffe Has Always Excelled In Service Quality Of Food And Ambiance.It Never Fails To Deliver On Expectations.,,,,,,
,416,Unfortunately We Didn't Get A Chance To Use The Spa  But We Really Could Criticise Anything  Everyone Was So Friendly And Accommodating And The Room Was So Lovely! Such A Shame To Hear That It's Closing! We Will Definitely Try And Come Back In September If We Can. ,,,,,,
,417,We Have Stayed A Number Of Times At The Marcliffe And Always Have A Very Relaxed Time. Everything Has Been Thought Of (Including Ice In The Ice Bucket) And The Staff Are Well Trained To Anticipate Ones Needs. ,,,,,,
,419,Very Satisfactory,,,,,,
,420,Very Good,,,,,,
,422,Disappointing.,,,,,,
,423,Extremely Enjoyable!!!!!!,,,,,,
,425,Usual High Standard,,,,,,
,428,Perfect In Every Way  All Hotels Should Aspire To The Level Of Friendliness And Service.,,,,,,
,429,Great Service And Wonderful Location,,,,,,
,430,Excellent As Usual  Service Superb  Room Excellent  Food Fantastic - We Are Really Going To Miss It.,,,,,,
,435,As I Have A Double Fracture To My Leg You You Kindly Upgraded Me To A Junior Suite With More Room For Me To Get Around On My Crutches/Wheelchair And Also A Walk In Shower.  I Found The Whole Experience From When I Arrived To Departure Absolutely Brilliant.  We Were There To Celebrate My Sister's Ruby Wedding Anniversary Which My Family Enjoyed Very Much.  You All Couldn't Do Enough For Me And I Would Like To Thank You And Your Staff For A Wonderful Stay At The Marcliffe.,,,,,,
,436,Relaxed And Comfortable Excellent Service And Attention Just Like Staying With Friends And Relations.,,,,,,
,437,Thoroughly Enjoyable,,,,,,
,439,Excellent. Really Sad You Will Be Closing. Will Be A Waste Of A Lovely Facility With Exceptional Service.,,,,,,
,440,A Great Experience Started With Friendly Staff On Arrival. Our Room Was In Good Condition And Very Clean  All You Could Want For A Short Stay. Bar And Restaurant Staff Were Very Good And Helpful.
I Could Go On But The Overall Stay Was Great.,,,,,,
,441,Just What You Want From A Hotel Break - To Relax And Feel Pampered,,,,,,
,445,Excellent  Very Professional Staff ,,,,,,
,446,I Would Like To Take This Opportunity To Say Thank You To All Staff Each And Every Member We Met Made This Very Special For Us . ,,,,,,
,447,Excellent And Friendly  As Always.,,,,,,
,448,Perfect---Please See My Emails To Gaynor,,,,,,
,449,Worst Experience Ever In An Hotel. On The Third Day Of Our Stay I Received A Telephone Call In My Room From The Owner Who Said: "I Am The Owner  You Are Not Welcome Here And I Want You Out Of My Hotel. Get Out!" And He Slammed The Phone Down Without Giving Any Explanation Or A Chance For Me To Speak. I Called Reception Asking For An Explanation And Agreed To See The Owner In The Reception Area. I Asked Him What Was The Problem But All He Could Say Was That He Didn't Need Me At The Hotel  He Said He Was A Millionaire And He Wanted Me Out Of The Hotel. Go Back To The Malmaison. We Will Not Serve You Any More Food Here. He Then Walked Off Whilst I Was Still Trying To Find Out What Caused This Attitude. I Could Only Presume It Was Because We Returned Two Dishes That Were Brought To Our Room That Evening Because; (I) The Goat Cheese Souffle Was Burnt On Top  And (Ii) The Smoked Salmon Was Not Of The Same Standard As We Had Previously. 
We Had Not Complained At Any Other Time About The Food And Could Not Understand The Owner's Reaction. The Only Other Matter That We Had Mentioned To Reception Was That We Did Not Have Any Hot Water On Both Of The Mornings That We Had Stayed There  But This Was Apparently Because The Boiler Had Tripped On Both Occasions And It Was Fixed Quickly.
We Have Stayed At Many 5 Star Hotels And Have Never Been Kicked Out Of Any Of Them Nor From Any 4 Star Hotels Where 5 Stars Were Not Available. We Were Both Very Shocked And Extremely Angry That This Has Happened  Which Successfully Ruined Our Long Weekend For What Seemed To Be A Very Petty Reason And Which Any Normal 5 Star Hotel Would Have Gladly Replaced The Meals Without Question To Keep The Customers Happy. I Know The Owner Is Selling The Property In November So He Probably Doesn't Care If He Insults The Clients But I Find This To Be Outrageous.
I Feel That I Was Well Within My Rights To Not Pay Anything And Just Leave  But Instead I Paid The Bill That Was Due And Left In Disgust.,,,,,,
,450,Excellent - Very Disappointed To Hear That By Far The Best Hotel I Have Found In Aberdeen Might Be Closing.  I Hope That This Fate Will Be Avoided.,,,,,,
,451,Have Always Enjoyed Staying At The Hotel - Regard It As Being Quite Special - Have Never Been Disappointed . ,,,,,,

,----------------------,,,,,,,
,1,As This Stay Was A Birthday Treat/Surprise For My Partner - The Staff Managed To Keep The Secret,,,,,,
,7,Whilst We Greatly Enjoyed Our Stay We Would Like To Comment On The Noise. We Stayed In The Balmoral Room And There Was A Private Function On In The Evening In The Garden Room. The Function Took Place Whilst We Were At Dinner So Had No Impact On Ourselves. The Clean Up After The Function However Did. The Waiting Staff Were Cleaning Until Just After Midnight. We Had Come To The Marcliffe For A Relaxing Afternoon And Evening As A Treat Before The Birth Of Our Child. The Noise Did Detract From This A Little. It May Be Preferential In The Future For Staff Members To Carry Out The Bear Minimum Of Clean-Up Work When The Rooms Adjacent Have Guests Staying.,,,,,,
,11,All Staff Were Friendly And Very Helpful. An Asset To The Hotel - Not One Member Of Staff Let The Team Down,,,,,,
,17,The Service Was Excellent,,,,,,
,18,Staff Were Incredibly Helpful Accommodating Our Late Arrival.,,,,,,
,20,I Had Emailed As The Website Could Not Accept The Particular Parameters Of My Booking. I Was Impressed With The Speed And Efficiency That My Enquiry Was Dealt With.,,,,,,
,26,Very Efficient And Friendly.,,,,,,
,27,We Arrived And No One Attended Us At The Entrance. It Was A Wired Situation Being In Front Of A Five Star Hotel With No Personnel In Sight. Only Inside At The Front Desk Was Personnel (Which Was Very Friendly And Helpfull!),,,,,,
,30,Good All Round   Lovely Hotel.,,,,,,
,31,Lindsay On The Desk Is A True Asset To The Hotel,,,,,,
,32,Staff Very Friendly And Approachable,,,,,,
,41,N/A,,,,,,
,44,Front Of House Staff Extremely Friendly & Helpful!,,,,,,
,46,No,,,,,,
,49,Very Helpful Arranging My Group Visit. Always Helpful And Quick To Reply To My Many Emails.,,,,,,
,50,When I Rang Reservations I Mentioned I Was Attending A Function At The Hotel And Expected To Be Given A Preferrential Rate.  However The Rate Given Was Â£10 More Expensive Than The Rate Available Online For Exactly The Same Details.  I Said This On The Phone And She Immediately Knocked Â£10 Off.  I Was Extremely Disappointed That Speaking To The Hotel I Was Given A More Expensive Rate.,,,,,,
,51,Excellent!!,,,,,,
,52,This Questionnaire Has Given Me The Opportunity To Discuss An Issue My Husband And I Experienced On Arrival At The Hotel.  We Were Greeted By A Girl At Reception Who Was Working Alongside A More Mature Woman With Blonde Hair.  We Were Dealt With In A Professional And Friendly Manner By Both Of These Staff Members  But The Atmosphere Quickly Changed When A Public Tantrum Ensued From The Restaurant Manager  Who Shouted Aggressively At The Mature Lady Behind Reception And Then Waited Impatiently For 'Something'  Which He Didn't Receive  Then He Stormed Off Back Into The Restaurant.  The Incident Lasted For A Minute Or Two But Left My Husband And I Uncomfortable And Shocked By Such Behaviour. I Was Very Disappointed By The Experience At The Hotel As Our Expections Were High And I Know The Reputation Of The Hotel Is Most Important.  There Was Also Another Guest Behind Us And Some Wedding Guests Lingering Around Reception And The Robert Gordons Band Who Were Warming Up.  So The Outburst Was Not Only Unprofessional  But Extremely Rude And Uncomfortable To Hear.  ,,,,,,
,53,We Had Asked For Early Check In As Attending Wedding & Needed To Change Out Of Travel Clothes. Thank You For Letting Us Do This.,,,,,,
,61,We Arrivd At 6.30Pm Nobody At Door But After A Short Wait At Reception The Welcome Was Warm,,,,,,
,64,It Would Be Useful To Be Made Aware Of Any Late Evening Events That Occur On The Website.,,,,,,
,71,Phillip Was Very Helpful And Professional With His Service Upon Arrival,,,,,,
,73,We Booked A Function Room For My 40Th Birthday Celebrations And You Could Not Have Done More For Us.  The Service Was Excellent  The Food Was Excellent  Handling Of The Reservation Prior To The Night Was Excellent.  I Wouldn't Hesitate To Use Your Hotel Again Or Receommend Your Hotel.  Thank You So Much For Making It An Amazing Evening.,,,,,,
,75,Guest Arrivals Could Be Enhanced Greatly By The Addition Of A Porter/Consierge/Parking Attend To Help Guests With Luggage From Their Car And Escort Them To Reception. At Present  Guests Experience No Welcome Until They Speak To Someone At Reception Desk. Kilted Man At The Front Entrance Would Make A Fabulous Addition And Sure To Be Loved By Foreign Guests.,,,,,,
,76,I Found The Staff On Arrival To Be Very Friendly And Lovely. Only Negative Comment Would Be When I Called Several Times To Arrange The Booking   Did Not Find The Staff Member To Be As Lovely   Cant Put It Into Words But Did Feel At The Time  Were We Going To Feel Comfortable At Your Hotel. Any How Your Staff On Arrival Quickly Sorted Any Of Those First Impressions Out. We Had A Wonderful Time . Thank You.,,,,,,
,77,The Decor In My Room Was A Littel Bit Bland But Otherwise It Was A Very Pleasant Stay.,,,,,,
,82,Excellent Service And Attendance To Any Needs Throughout My Stay. Thank You,,,,,,
,83,My Husband Paid For Our Dinner  Bed And Breakfast Voucher Through A Charity Event Which He Paid Well For But As It Was For A Good Cause We Did Not Mind. However When I Phoned To Book The Room I Did Mention I Was Paying For One Night With A Voucher And I Got The Impression From The Lady Who I Spoke To That I Was On A Cheap Deal. This Might Have Been A Wrong Interpretation On My Behalf But I Was A Little Put Off As A Result. The Room We Were Given For The First Night Was Very Close To The Function Rooms But We Were Not Attending Any Function. This Did Make Us Feel We Perhaps Had A Cheaper Room. We Moved Rooms For Our Second Night Which Was A Much Quieter Room And We Slept Well.,,,,,,
,84,We Had A Lovely Stay & Our Friends Wedding Was Fantastic. The Room Was Very Nice & Breakfast Was Delicious  However  We Do Struggle To Justify Â£170 For B&B.  We Do Understand It Is A 5 Star Hotel Etc But We Found The Room Price Rather Expensive For A Wedding.,,,,,,
,87,All The Staff Were Helpful And It Was A Nice Touch That They Were Aware We Were On A Spa Package & Staying Overnight At The Hotel.,,,,,,
,90,Perfect  As Usual.,,,,,,
,91,The Staff At The Marcliffe Create A Very Comfortable Environment  But Like Any Good Member Of Staff You Hardly Notice They Are There.,,,,,,
,97,There Was No One At The Frfont To Take Luggage Or At Reception For A Short Time But It Didn't Matter It Gave Us Time To Look Around The Reception Area Which Was Lovely.,,,,,,
,100,Staff Are Always Friendly And Helpful,,,,,,
,104,No Issues All Went Well,,,,,,
,106,I Travel Extensively For Business Throughout North America  Europe And Uk  I Always Look Forward To My Stays At The Marcliffe Not Just For The Wonderful Ambience  But More Importantly For Your Staff Who Are Genuinely Welcoming And Sincere.,,,,,,
,109,No,,,,,,
,110,Just A Nice Bunch Of People. Obvious Training Is A Key Element. Well Trained Young Staff Is A Joy To See!,,,,,,
,113,When Booking On Line  Looking At All The Rooms  You Don't Know Which One You Are Booking So  Although I Had Booked On Line  I Also Called To Find Out About The Room We Would Be Staying In.,,,,,,
,122,I Cannot Recommend A Stay At The Marcliffe Highly Enough. I Can't Fault The Service  The Room Or The Food. My Wife  Friends And I Had The Most Fantastic Time And Will Definitely Come Back Again.,,,,,,
,124,The Staff Was Extremely Friendly And Helpful! We Enjoyed Our Stay And Definitely Plan To Return. They Helped Us Arrange A Driver During Our Stay.,,,,,,
,132,My First Room # 216 ?? Was Next To The Outside Door Of The Kitchen. This Room Was Very Noisy Because Of All The Activity & Lights From The Kitchen. Our 2Nd Room  Which Was A Suite  Was Wonderful!!!,,,,,,
,134,Was Impressed That  At Check-In  We Were Just Provided With A Key  Taken To Our Room And Set To Get Relaxing Asap.  There Was No Credit Card Swipe And No Discussion About Payment Until We Checked Out.  So Welcoming And Friendly  Like Coming To Stay With A Friend!,,,,,,
,144,There Was No Doorman To Help Us Unload Our Luggage,,,,,,
,146,No,,,,,,
,147,Quick Response To A Request By Email,,,,,,
,153,I Arrived Late And Left Early The Next Morning So The Stay Was Very Short  But Everything Was Handled Extremely Efficiently.,,,,,,
,154,The Valet Really Went Above. He Parked My Car And Brought The Keys Up To My Room. I Don't Think That Was Really Part Of His Job. Can't Remember His Name Cute Young Guy. Kudos!!!,,,,,,
,157,Perfect,,,,,,
,164,Everything Was Extremely Positive And Wonderful  No 'Fault' Could Be Found With Anything!,,,,,,
,173,We Love The Marcliff And Will Be Staying Everytime We Come To Aberdeen.  Thank You So Much For Our Pleasure Vists.,,,,,,
,181,1) We Initially Tried To Make A Reservation Through Slh  But Were Told That Your Hotel Had No Availability For The Dates We Requested. I Immediately Called The Marcliffe Directly And There Was No Issue With The Dates  So I Made A Reservation. Is This Odd? 2) We Had Reserved A Different Suite  But It Was Under Refurb When We Arrived. We Were Given The Fyvie And Were Very Pleased. The Only (And I Mean Only) Issue Was That There Was A Very Bad Smell In The Suite. I Didn't Bring It Up While I Was There Because: A) We Were Very Busy And Didn't Want To Take The Time To Deal With It; B) It Was Apparent That The Only Option Would Have Been To Move To A Smaller Suite  Which We Did Not Want To Do. I Came To Realize That The Smell Was Probably Coming From The Refurb Work That Was Being Done In The Adjacent Suite. My Only Reason For Telling You This Is That I Think Someone Should Have Realized It Before We Checked In. No Problem Though Really.  ,,,,,,
,184,I Was Quite Surprised When 'Phoning At 07.00 P.M. To Make The Booking To Be Told That Reservations Were Closed And That I Would Have To Call Back Next Day Between 08.00 And 17.00.,,,,,,
,185,We Will See You Next Year!!!!!,,,,,,
,188,Drove Up To Front Door With Three Receptionists And Porter Watching. None Made Any Effort To Welcome Us. Walked To Reception  Haded Car Key To Porter. Checked In. Were Asked If We Want To Be Shown To Room Now (Luggage And Car Werre Still Outside). Suggested That Someone May Want To Take Care Of Both....,,,,,,
,196,Process Was Impeccable From E-Mail Confirmation Of Reservation; Checkin Process; Luggage Transport To Room And Orientation To Room And Hotel.  Every Question Was Answered Or Intuitively Offered  But Staff Dissolved As Soon As Their Support Was Complete.  Indicative Of A Very Well-Polished Staff.  Bravo,,,,,,
,199,I Just Love Everything About The Marcliffe And Always Find The Staff So Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,,
,201,Everything Was As We Would Expect From An Hotel Of This Quality.,,,,,,
,203,We Were Made Immediately Welcome  With Staff Showing Great Professionalism In Their Dealings With Us,,,,,,
,204,When Our Rental Car Got Delayed  The Staff Went Out Of Their Way To Help Us. Driving Me To Royal Aberdeen And Then My Wife  And Then Delivering The Rental Car To The Golf Club. Above And Beyond!!,,,,,,
,206,I Appreciated Having The Service Of Having My Shoes Polished,,,,,,
,207,Everything Went Seamlessly On Arriva,,,,,,
,215,Your Staff Gave Us A Helpful Tariff In A Very Friendly Manner,,,,,,
,216,Arrived Early  Tea Served Until Room Ready; In 30 Minutes. Excellent.,,,,,,
,217,A Bit Embarassing - Our Booking Was Wrong Although I Had Spoken To A Staff Member In Reservations - We Were Expected Next Month! So There Was A Bit Of Confusion At Reception While This Was Sorted Out - Not The Best Start To Our Evening.,,,,,,
,220,Absolutely Wonderful.  Aberdeen Is Losing A Jewel.  How Sad.,,,,,,
,223,Extremely Efficient And Helpful Staff.,,,,,,
,224,5 Star Service.,,,,,,
,233,Everything Went So Smoothly It Was Without Fault.,,,,,,
,238,No,,,,,,
,239,All Positive For Our First Experience Of  5 Star Luxury,,,,,,
,241,Very Welcoming Atmosphere And Staff Friendly And Unstuffy,,,,,,
,244,The Entire Stay Was Excellent-Staff  Room  Restaurant.  We Were Part Of The Friday Evening Graduation Dinner And It Was Very Well Done Also.  Big Thanks To All.,,,,,,
,245,The Staff Are Terrific. We Had Dinner Breakfast And Tea And Could Not Be More Delighted With The Food And The Service. They Remembered Our Favorites And Preferences And Made Us Feel At Home,,,,,,
,246,Thje Only Negative Comment I Have  Is   That The Owner Crossing Our Way In The Hotel  Never  Responded To Our Greeting  Total Contrarily Compared With The Hotelstaff. ,,,,,,
,249,Everything Was Friendly And First Class. Staff Absolutely Great. Luggage Taken To Room By Helpful Member Of Your Team.,,,,,,
,250,As I Have Stayed At The Marcliffe Before And On Both Occassions Every Aspect Of My Stay Was  Excellent And I Will Definetly Be Staying At The Marcliffe In The Future.   The Staff Were Excellent As Was The Accommodiation,,,,,,
,251,Very Professional  Courteous  Informative  Sensitive And Attentive To Any Requests And Assistance Required!,,,,,,
,261,The Staff Were Very Helpful Helping Us Get To Our Room As My Husband Is In A Wheelchair And We Had A Lot Of Luggage,,,,,,
,262,Pity Stuart Has Decided To Retire  I Hope To Saty With You One More Time Before You Close In Novembe 2014.,,,,,,
,264,Welcomed As An Old Friend,,,,,,
,267,As Always - Seamless!,,,,,,
,272,Although We See Both New And Familiar Staff It Is Always Wonderful To Be Back At The Marcliffe.,,,,,,
,288,All Praise To The Maitre Dee Who Was So Professional  On The Ball And Alert.  We Were Most Impressed.,,,,,,
,301,Very Friendly And Welcoming Staff,,,,,,
,305,It Was Everything I Had Been Told  I Have Stayed And Worked In Many Hotels Nationwide And So Far The Marcliffe Has Ticked Every Box And Added More Boxes And Ticked Those Too.   We Were Very Impressed.,,,,,,
,306,No,,,,,,
,343,No,,,,,,
,346,We Had To Come Into The Hotel And Ask That Someone Come Out And Help Us With Our Bags.  No One Was Waiting At The Door To Offer Help.  I Also Saw Elderly Couples Struggling To Open The Door As They Arrived Because No One Was Waiting At The Door To Help Or To Offer A Welcome.  Once Checked In However  The Staff Very Very Welcoming And Helpful.,,,,,,
,351,No,,,,,,
,352,Staff Couldn't Be More Helpful And Friendly.,,,,,,
,357,None,,,,,,
,364,N/A,,,,,,
,365,The Staff Helped With Reservations In A Welcoming Manner.  The Process Was Professional And Efficient.  I Was Immediately Made To Feel Welcome And At Ease.  This Is Credit To Them.  ,,,,,,
,368,One Member Of Satff Recommeded A Lebanese Red Wine Which Was Very Nice: Could You Let Me Have The Name Of It (Assuming There Is Only One),,,,,,
,372,Reception Was Quick To Get Porter To Assist,,,,,,
,374,Very Welcoming,,,,,,
,375,The Reception Staff Were Extremely Welcoming  Friendly And Efficient.,,,,,,
,380,No,,,,,,
,386,Flawless,,,,,,
,389,Staff Were All Lovely And Very Efficient - Couldn't Fault The Service Except The Owner (Please See Previous Comment). Perhaps It Is Just As Well Stewart Spence Is Retiring - If He Treats Other Guests The Way He Treated Me There Would Be No Guests.,,,,,,
,391,Everything Was Done With Utmost Professionalism. ,,,,,,
,393,There Was A Deep Fry Smell Lingering In The Lobby  Which Was The Only Negative And Not Good As First Impression.,,,,,,
,395,Only One Small Issue. We Stayed In The Braemer Suite.  The Radiator Was A Little Noisy.,,,,,,
,397,Staff All Very Friendly And Courteous.,,,,,,
,399,Nothing Else. It Was All Positive.,,,,,,
,401,No,,,,,,
,404,None,,,,,,
,405,My Husband Booked The Room Online  Very Smooth Process And Contact Was Very Easy..,,,,,,
,408,Extremely Satisfied With Everything,,,,,,
,410,None,,,,,,
,412,Positive Experience.,,,,,,
,417,As Usual As Soon As I Mention My Name The Staff Have My Information To Hand And Make Me Feel A Valued Customer.,,,,,,
,419,No,,,,,,
,423,Very Efficient And Friendly Staff.,,,,,,
,425,All Staff Dealt With Were Efficient And Friendly,,,,,,
,434,I Emailed In Advance To Book A Spa Treatment And Had To Chase For A Response Twice.  By The Time I Actually Spoke To Someone I Couldn't Get The Times I Wanted,,,,,,
,435,Since Having My Accident After The Initial Booking Was Made - The Accommodation Kindly Offered By Gaynor At No Extra Cost To Myself Was Absolutely Brilliant And Made The Worries Over My Stay Go Away.  It Enabled Me To Enjoy The Evening Along With Everyone Else And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble.  ,,,,,,
,436,I Felt As Though "You" Were Really Looking Forward To Our Visit  So Welcoming.,,,,,,
,437,Experience Very Good,,,,,,
,446,Can't Say Enough How Happy We Are About The Whole Experience From The Time We Walked Through The Doors Until We Walked Back Out  ,,,,,,
,449,There Is A Strong Unpleasant Burnt Cooking Smell That Pervades Throughout The Reception  Lounge And Dining Room  That Is Very Noticeable When Arriving From Outside.,,,,,,
,451,No Further Comments - Everything As Expected - Relaxed And Cordial ,,,,,,

,Total Responses:,131,,,,,,
,Not Answered:,0,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,,
,1,Beautiful Decor And Extemely Comfy Bed,,,,,,
,5,The Bedroom Was Very Clean But Is Starting To Look Tired And Dated  I Know That You Can Not Cater To Everyone's Needs But I Found The Bed Uncomfortable And Did Not Have A Good Nights Sleep. The Facilities In The Room Were Good.,,,,,,
,7,Some Areas Of The Room Could Do With A Little Attention. The Room However Was Very Clean And To A Very High Standard.,,,,,,
,8,The Taps For The Wash Basin Should Be Changed To Allow For Hot And Cold Water Mixing.,,,,,,
,17,Really Appreciated The Toiletries  Fruit  Soft Drinks That Were Complementary. The Room Was Lovely And The Shower Was Amazing!,,,,,,
,18,Fantastic Room.,,,,,,
,20,Particularly Impressed With How Impeccably Clean The Room Was  The High Quality Amenities E.G. Molton Brown Sundries And The High Comfort Level Of The Furnishings.,,,,,,
,22,Lovely Soft Towels! :),,,,,,
,27,It Was A Very Nice Welcome. Thanks Also For The Honeymoon Post-Card. Only Negative: In All Other Hotels (4 Stars - While Marcliffe Was Our Only 5 Star On The Road Tripp) We Have Received Also A Bottle Of Champagen  Prosecco Or Were Offered A Drink At The Bar.,,,,,,
,32,Perfect Room.,,,,,,
,37,In Regards To The Bedroom We Stayed In Mey -Bathroom Very Run Down And The Bedroom Was Very Tired Looking I Was Disappointed As It Is A Five Star Hotel . There Was Constant Noise From The Wedding Function !,,,,,,
,38,We Stayed In Your Craigievar Room And Were Most Disappointed By The Standard Of The Room  The Furniture Was Very Dated And Worn And The Bathroom Was Far From What I Would Have Expected From A 5 Star Hotel. The Shower Fluctuated In Temperature Quite Dramatically And Was Very Old  Clearly No Money Has Been Spent On This Room For Some Time. I Had Hoped For More From Our Room Given The Previous Time We Stayed At Your Hotel Our Room Was Much Better Appointed And Larger.,,,,,,
,39,Main Bedroom Light Was Not Working  And Cold Water Tap Was Not Working (Floors Room),,,,,,
,41,I Had A Few Issues Being From The Us On Figuring Out How To Use The Overhead Shower Instead Of The Handheld  And I Didn't Figure It Out. It Might Be Helpful To Include Instructions In The Room Detail Book Just In Case. I Also Was Unsure Of How The Channels On The Tv Worked  Such As If There Was An Extra Charge For The Movie And Us Channels  So I Didn't Access Those During My Stay.,,,,,,
,49,Noise Levels Outside 104 Quite High When Function Suite Emptied Around 1 Am,,,,,,
,50,I Think The Bathrooms Are Starting To Look A Little Dated However The Room,,,,,,
,51,Beautiful!,,,,,,
,56,The Wifi Signal In My Room Was Very Poor Strength  Meaning Trying To Use Internet Was Next To Useless.,,,,,,
,57,Only That There Should Be Options For Blackout Curtains In The Family (Adjoining Rooms)  And That The Doors Should Not Be Openable (Unlockable) From The Inside,,,,,,
,59,The Only Negative Aspect In An Otherwise Excellent Experience Was The Extremely High Tog Quilt.It Was So Hot I Was Unable To Sleep Properly But I Would Imagine This Is A Requirement In Aberdeen For Most Of The Year.The Hotel Was Probably Unfortunate In This Regard As The Weather During My Stay Was Mild.,,,,,,
,61,Well Cleaned By Housekeeping.,,,,,,
,67,Excellent,,,,,,
,71,Overly Soft Bed.  Tv Volume Turned On It Own  On Multiple Occasions At Night During The Week,,,,,,
,73,Some Rooms/Bathrooms Are In Need In A Little Modernising But Very Clean And Comfortable.,,,,,,
,75,We Were In Crathes.  The Room Itself Is Lovely  Great Proportions And Just Delightful To Be At Garden Level.  Bathroom Facilities Really Let The Room Down.  Mira Shower  Plastic Moulded Tops And Ancient Fittings Just Don't Come Up To Scratch. Very Dated. It Would Also Be Nice For Robes To Be Visible.  Tucked Away In The Top Shelf Of Cupboard And Still Bagged  Lets Us Know That You Don't Really Want Us To Use Them.,,,,,,
,77,Decor A Bit Boring,,,,,,
,83,We Expected The Bedrooms To Be More Modern But They Were Very Tidy  Clean And Perfectly Adequate. However There Was No Movies Available On The Tv And The Number Of Channels Available Was Less Than Expected.,,,,,,
,84,As Stated Previously The Price,,,,,,
,89,Room Was Very Hot Overnight.,,,,,,
,91,Beautiful Quality And Attention To Detail Was Noticeable,,,,,,
,92,Probably Need A Shower Curtain To Prevent Water Spills In Teh Bathroom,,,,,,
,94,I Greatly Appreciated The Complimentary Fresh Fruits In Addition To The General Tea And Biscuits,,,,,,
,96,I Usually Find Something That Needs Fixing  Often The Shower. The Wifi Is Too Slow.,,,,,,
,103,Wifi Is Often Poor,,,,,,
,104,All Excellent,,,,,,
,106,I Am So Pleased To Have The Internet System Upgraded.  It Was The Only Downfall But Even Then It Was Worth The Visit:),,,,,,
,107,We Were Unable To Sleep Until After One In The Morning As There Was A Wedding Function Taking Place  Our Room Was Directly Above   This Coupled With The Door Opening And Closing To The Left Of Our Bedroom To The Fire Exit  It Was Very Noisy. We Did Complain But There Were No Other Available Rooms And No Ear Defenders Available. They Did Reduce The Room Tarrif  But It Certainly Spoilt Our Experience.,,,,,,
,109,Shower In The Morning Was Look Warm And Was Unable To Adjust It To Make It Hotter,,,,,,
,114,Perfect,,,,,,
,118,The Bathroom Was Very 'Tired ' Looking   And I Felt The Bedroom Was At The End Of A Long Corridor Reminiscent Of A Motel.  I Was Disappointed In The Room.  I Think The Complimentary Elements In The Bar Were A Very Good Gesture (I Only Took The Nuts)  But Felt I Was In A Motel Add On To A Very Classy Restaurant/ House Hotel,,,,,,
,120,Room Was A Little Tired  But A Good Nights Sleep Was Had  Refreshments From The Mini-Bar Were Good (And Keenly Priced)   Fruit On Arrival Was An Excellent Touch .. Felt Very Relaxed The Whole Time!,,,,,,
,121,Nothing In Hotel Literature Regarding Wi-Fi,,,,,,
,124,The Crathise Suite Was Very Beautifully Decorated And Spacious. The View Was Very Nice And The Room Was Quiet.,,,,,,
,131,Bathroom Was Dated For A 5* Hotel,,,,,,
,132,My Husband Stayed Earlier In The Week And The Twin Beds Are Way Too Small For Tall Men!,,,,,,
,134,Beautiful  Pristine  Fabulous Beds  Everything We Needed.,,,,,,
,136,I Stayed In Dunrobin And Just For Info The Door Latch Was Faulty And Very Difficult To Close. I Meant To Mention Before Checking Out But Forgot To Do So.,,,,,,
,139,Air Conditioning In The Room Would Have Been Nice As The Weather Was Warm And The Room Became Uncomfortable  However We Were Able To Get A Fan From The Reception/House Keeping Really Easily,,,,,,
,142,Bathroom A Little Dated. It Was A Very Warm Evening And Despite The Window Being Open  The Bedroom Was Hot. If There Was An Air Conditioning Unit  I Was Unaware Of This.,,,,,,
,145,Unfortunately The Junior Suite That We Stayed In Turned Out To Be Very Noisy.  You Could Hear The Doors Banging In The Lobby And There Was A Sound Above Us Like Someone Throwing A Ball On The Floor.  I Made This Known The Next Morning And The Staff Were To Investigate As There Are No Rooms Above The Room That We Stayed In.  We Stayed In The Fyvie Suite Before And Found That Experience Far Superior To That Of The Junior Suite We Had On 9Th August - I Think It Was Room 402?  It Was A Bit Of A Let Down But The Staff Were Friendly As Always.  I Felt That As The Hotel Was Busy With Golfers/Wedding Parties That We Were Given That Room In The Back Of Beyond In The Hotel Because We Were Perhaps Not Seen As Priority Guests?,,,,,,
,146,No,,,,,,
,147,A Light In The Cupboard That Contained The Tea/Coffee Facilities,,,,,,
,151,I Thought The Carpet Had A Musty Smell.,,,,,,
,152,My Main Comment Is That The Room Was Very Hot On The First Night (Due To A Heatwave) I Didn't Know How To Open The Windows When I Got Back Late.  As There Is No Aircon It Was Very Difficult To Sleep That Night.  Bottles Of Water Should Be Available At No Cost.,,,,,,
,153,The Room Was Located Near The Kitchen And  Since I Left The Window Open  I Expected To Be Awaken Early By The Noise.  To My Surprise  It Was Very Quiet.,,,,,,
,155,Far Too Warm  Even With The Windows Open. We Would Really Have Appreciated The Ability To Set Our Own Room Temperature. Loved The Quality Of The Tea  Coffee And Biscuits. Loved That You Provided Small Slippers As Usually They Are Like Snow Shoes On Me! Loved The Fruit. Loved The Easy To Use Safe But Needed Instructions On How To Operate It As Didn't Realise You Used Your Own Card. The Room Was Extremely Comfortable (Apart From The Temperature)  And Well Equipped. It Was A Wonderful Surprise And Much Appreciated To Find That We Had New Towels Supplied Without Requesting Them  On The Evening Of Our Stay. It Is Always Difficult In A Hotel Room To Find Enough Space To Hang Wet Towels Up To Dry For The Following Morning  So This Was A Really Wonderful Service.,,,,,,
,157,The Noise Outside Was So Bad I Didn't Sleep  People Were Outside Until 2.30Am Then Again From 6Am,,,,,,
,158,A Beautiful Room  Well Appointed And Felt Like Being More At Home Than Hotel!,,,,,,
,162,We Were Upgraded To A Suite When The Door Handle Of The Original Room Broke. It Was Handled Very Professionally And The Room Move Was Made Very Easy For Us. We Have Stayed In A Suite Before So Were Delighted To Have The Spoil Again. The Room Was Absolutely Lovely.,,,,,,
,165,A Bit Too Dark,,,,,,
,171,Bathroom Underfloor Heating. Scottish Winter.............Mmmmmmmm   Great Idea,,,,,,
,175,We Felt This Time There Was A Stuffy Smell In The Room. We Tried To Keep The Windows Open For Fresh Air. We Also Found It Noisy With The Main Door Just Below The Windows. Beds Could Be A Bit More Comfortable They Can Be On The Hard Side .,,,,,,
,177,Lighting Could Have Been Brighter,,,,,,
,181,Very Comfortable. Loved The Shower (Separate From The Bathtub Is A Good Thing!). Loved The View. Comfortable Bed  Although We Found The Pillows To Be A Bit Firm. Location Of Fyvie Made For Easy Access To The Rest Of The Hotel.,,,,,,
,183,A Little Confusion On Reservation  Originally Booked An Executive Room For Two Nights. Via E-Mail Asked For An Upgrade To A Junior Suite  Did Not Receive A Reply. At Check-In Got A Suite For Only One Night Due To Availability Then Moved To An Executive Room. As A First Time Guest At A Slh  Had An Expectation For A Complimentary Upgrade. Again Ran Into Availability Issues  Well Understood. Popular Destination. Sa La Vie,,,,,,
,188,We Are All For Being 'Gren' And Re-Using For Example Towels. Still This Is The First Hotel Were We Were Admonished In Writing With 'Most Guest Reuse Their Towels'. The Warning That Breakfast May Be Slow Due To Conventions/Weddings Does Not Fit A Small Luxury Hotel Property!,,,,,,
,189,All Was To A Very High Standard And Showed No Signs Of Wear And Tear!! Nice To See The Fruit Bowl Replenished Each Day.,,,,,,
,193,Too Warm  Lighter Duvet Required In Summer.,,,,,,
,199,No,,,,,,
,205,We Were Allocated The Eilan Donan Room Which Was Very Noisy - Extractor Fan From Kitchen. We Were Moved To Another Room (113) Which Was Quieter But Less Well Presented,,,,,,
,211,Outside Door Rotting. No View,,,,,,
,214,To Far Away From The Facilities And A Really Noisy Passageway For The Staff Early In The Morning.,,,,,,
,215,We Did Hear A Little Toilet Noise From A Bedroom Nearby!,,,,,,
,217,Thought The Design And Decor Are Getting Dated.,,,,,,
,220,Lovely Decor & Lovely Touches.,,,,,,
,223,Lovely Room.,,,,,,
,233,It Was Just Right. Absolutely No Complaints,,,,,,
,240,No Sky! Council Telly! No Dressingdowns,,,,,,
,243,Bathroom A Little Dated.,,,,,,
,245,We Requested The Suite  We Had Two Years Ago And We Very Happy It Could Be Made Available To Us Again. It Was Comfortable Quiet And Very Clean,,,,,,
,247,Yes  Very Pleased To Be Upgraded On Arrival As A Member Of Slh.,,,,,,
,249,Very Comfortable Bed. Plenty Space (Floors Room). Lighting Was Great - I Could Read The Paper Without Removing The Lampshades! Good Shower. Little Touches - Fruit  Chocolate Bars  Soft Drinks And Really Nice Coffee - All Much Appreciated  And Well Worth The Extra Charge. Housekeeping Staff Also Great - Maintaining A  High Standard,,,,,,
,250,Excellent !,,,,,,
,251,On A Very Personal Basis  I Myself Am Not Very Keen On A Fixed High Showerhead! However Having The Hand Shower Freedom Provided  Did Compensate Somewhat And Of Course The Shower Caps Were Provided  Which Are Most Helpful To The Ladies In Our Lives!,,,,,,
,258,Very Relaxing And Clean Nice To Have Refreshments Available.,,,,,,
,260,The Bathroom Floor Was Slippery  Especially When Wearing Socks Or The 'Slippers' Provided.,,,,,,
,261,I Had Requested A Large Room  This Was Not. It Was Meant To Be Suitable For Someone In A Wheelchair  My Husband Had Difficulty Turning & He Coulnt Get His Knees Under The Basin By Nearly A Metre . We Had To Take The Foot Plates Off Every Time He Washed.This Bathroom Was Not Designed By Someone Who Understands Disability. None Of These Problems Were Any Fault Of The Staff  They Were All Exceptional.,,,,,,
,263,Room Service Was Very Unexpected But Very Much Appreciated!,,,,,,
,266,We Especially Appreciated The Shower - So Many Places Just Have Dribblers These Days.,,,,,,
,267,Beds Marvellously Comfortable - A Home From Home!,,,,,,
,272,Underfloor Heating. Winter In Scotland........Mmmmmmm Fabulous,,,,,,
,282,The Mattress Was Very Lumpy (Mattress Topper) And Spoiled An Other Wonderful Visit,,,,,,
,288,We Were Pleased To Receive The Upgrade For Being A Member Of The Slh Group,,,,,,
,294,Air Conditioning Would Have Been Nice As The Weather Was Really Hot And The Room Got Uncomfortable. However  We Were Able To Get A Fan For The Room Very Easily Via Reception And Housekeeping,,,,,,
,296,It Was A Very Warm Time When We Stayed And We Found The Room Very Hot.,,,,,,
,301,Lovely Rooms With Absolutely Everything You Could Need,,,,,,
,305,Just Perfect,,,,,,
,306,In Blair Suite The Bath Hot Tap Did Not Work.  ( I Am Sorry I Meant To Mention This  At The Time).  Also When I Had Showers There Was A Puddle On The Floor Nest To The Shower Screen  And I Had Tried To Make Sure The Shower Screen Was Properly In Place   And It Still Happened,,,,,,
,317,Quality Of Toilet Paper Is Important. Quilted Would Be Nice And Commensurate With The Standard Of The Facilities At A V Ery Small Extra Cost.,,,,,,
,338,Room Was Good Bathroom Tired Looking ,,,,,,
,342,Perhaps Require Some Redecoration But In View Of Your Closure Unlikely. Otherwise  Bedroom Perfectly Ok.,,,,,,
,346,Our Suite Was Beautiful And Very Clean. ,,,,,,
,351,Rather Dull Lighting. Lovely Otherwise. Two Cleaners Knocked At The Door. One Around 8.30Am And One At 8.50Am. We Were Not To Be Out Of The Room Till 10.30Am So I Didn't Think It Was Nice Having To Twice Say 'Sorry Not Yet'. They Were However Very Polite.,,,,,,
,357,Prefer A Dedicated Shower.,,,,,,
,362,We Were Given A Complimentary Upgrade Which Was A Kind Gesture. Everything About The Room Was Perfect Even Down To Free Chocolate Bars In The Mini Bar  Which Me Being A Chocoholic Was Irresistible. ,,,,,,
,364,No,,,,,,
,366,Very Comfortable  Bed And Pillows Excellent!,,,,,,
,368,Craithes Suite So Very Nice,,,,,,
,370,Bathroom Could Do With An Update But As You Are Closing In November... No Point Really!,,,,,,
,372,Rooms Are Clean And Have Every Amenity You Need,,,,,,
,374,Clean And Very Functional For Our Needs.,,,,,,
,381,The Water Was Only Luke Warm For The Shower Even Although We Ran It For A Long Time. !,,,,,,
,393,The Towel Rack Is Dangerous  Despite The Warning.  Best To Keep It Switched Off.,,,,,,
,394,The Only Negative Was An Issue With No Hot Water In The Morning. Nothing Major Though. ,,,,,,
,396,No Hot Water For Shower In The Morning,,,,,,
,399,Ideal And Easy Access To Car Park Through Patio Doors.,,,,,,
,401,No,,,,,,
,404,Better Selection To The Tv Channels Would Be Desireable (Especially Since I've Been A Regular Working Week Guest For The Last 3 Months),,,,,,
,405,Room Was Stunning  Spotlessly Clean  Warm And Welcoming  Very Comfortable...,,,,,,
,408,Booked Into Balmoral  Was Totally Delighted With Your Choice Of Room,,,,,,
,412,My Husband Commented That's It's The Easiest Internet Connection He's Ever Had In A Hotel,,,,,,
,417,Very Comfortable Beds.,,,,,,
,419,No,,,,,,
,422,There Was A Humming Noise That Turned Out To Be An Extractor Fan In The Kitchen. This Made The Room Very Noisy. We Eventually Had To Call Reception At 2.45Am To Ask What The Noise Was And Could It Be Stopped.
The Water In The Shower Was Not Hot Enough.,,,,,,
,428,Absolutely Fabulous  Blown Away From The Moment We Entered The Room.,,,,,,
,435,I Think This Was Without Doubt Brilliant And Very Much Appreciated. ,,,,,,
,436,We Were In Crathes So Really Felt The Atmosphere Of The Original House!!,,,,,,
,445,Bath Too Small Shallow  Short And Plastic  Not Very 5 Star ,,,,,,
,448,Albeit I Know The Plans For The Future Of The Hotel  One Small Observation In The Bathroom--A Shaving Mirror With Magnificantion.,,,,,,
,449,The Hot Water Was Not Working On Both Mornings That We Stayed There And Had To Be Fixed Before We Could Take A Shower.,,,,,,
,451,All As Expected  - High Standard .,,,,,,

,----------------------,,,,,,,
,1,The Meal Was Amazing From Start To Finish And The Staff Were Very Attentitive,,,,,,
,14,My Wife's Rib Rye Of Pork Was Very Dry. She Did Not Say At The Time As She Was Full From Starter And We Were Enjoying The Atmosphere At The Time,,,,,,
,17,We Had An Excellent Time  The Service Was Some Of The Best We Have Ever Had.,,,,,,
,27,The Evening Started Out Very Nice With A Drink In The Drawing Room. Then Unfortunatley The Mess Began  Where We Waited More Then 40 Minutes For Our Pre Booked Table. Then It Continued With A Long Wait For The Starter And The Main Dish. Which Lasted More Then 1H30minutes. We Were So Tired That We Have Ordered The Desert To The Room (Where It Was Nicely Delivered) But My Wife Was Already So Tired That She Couldnt Even Eat It Anymore. Very Very Very Disappointed.,,,,,,
,31,Had Room Service,,,,,,
,32,Great Food And Fantastic Service As Always. Staff Knowledgeable On Food And Wines.,,,,,,
,33,We Were Surprised That We Seemed To Be The Only Guests Seated In The Restaurant Section  Rather Than The Conservatory Section For The Majority Of Our Meal Which Made Us Feel Uneasy. Additionally  Due To The Close Proximity To The Kitchen And The Large Number Of Steaks Being Fried  We Left The Restaurant Smelling Of Food.,,,,,,
,35,Bar Area Small For The Amount Of Guests/ Events. In The Afternoon No Seats Available And The Staff Kindly Cleared A Table In The Restaurant. This Was Due To A Ladies Lunch Event But In The Evening When We Went For Pre Dinner Drinks Again The Bar Area Was Extremely Busy - This May Have Been Due To Evening Events However Surely They Should Have Other Facilities Rather Than Using The Main Bar For Guests. If This Could Be Rectified It Would Have Been An 'Excellent' Review,,,,,,
,37,Menu Very Limited We Had A Steak And It Was Served On A Very Old Round Plate Not Five Star Standard I Would Have Thought . Was Never Asked To Taste The Wine It Was Just Poured!!,,,,,,
,41,The Staff Was Excellent And The Food Delicious! I Would've Like To See Some Poultry On The Dinner Menu As It Was Mostly Beef Or Seafood.,,,,,,
,44,Staff Very Welcoming And Friendly,,,,,,
,46,Nice To See Local Food On Menu,,,,,,
,47,I Would Like To Thank The Staff Who Prepared A 10Th Anniversary Surprise When We Sat Down To Tea & Coffee,,,,,,
,50,We Attended The Mri Function And All Staff As Always Were Just Superb.  We Attend Many Functions And Stay In Many Many Hotels With Our Business However Have Found The Marcliffe Bar Far To Be The Best.  I Have Absolutely No Complaints About Any Aspect Of The Hotel.,,,,,,
,51,Fantastic Food!  Just Brilliant!,,,,,,
,53,Lovely Breakfast,,,,,,
,56,Service Was Spot On  Very Friendly Efficient Staff.,,,,,,
,57,Wonderful Food Overall And Fantastic Service With It.,,,,,,
,61,Fantastic Experiance From Beginning To End,,,,,,
,63,Regarding Breakfast. I Did Not Find The Breakfast To Be Of Great Quality. Ordered Eggs Came Fried Rather Than Poached  Tomato's Were Not Cooked And Mushrooms Were Cold  No Sausage Although On The Menue.,,,,,,
,68,Very Professional Service And Friendly Waiting Staff. Food Excellent.,,,,,,
,69,Dining With Kids The Time Between Plates And Waiting For The Children's Food Was Vert Long,,,,,,
,73,Private Dinning Experience Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,75,Restaurant And Bar Service Was First Class !  We Were Celebrating A Birthday And Staff Were Absolutely Fantastic. As Always  Food Wonderful !,,,,,,
,77,Excellent Venue,,,,,,
,78,Fantastic Menu And A Lovely Atmosphere.,,,,,,
,83,We Cannot Fault The Dining Experience At All. The Staff Were Extremely Helpful And Knowledgable. The Food Was Of Very High Standard And The Menu Was Excellent. We Had Breakfast  Lunch And Dinner At The Hotel And All Were Memorable.,,,,,,
,87,I Can Honestly Say That It Was One Of The Best Dining Experience I Have Ever Had! Absolutely Amazing Food And The Service Was Out Of This World.,,,,,,
,91,Excellent,,,,,,
,92,More Buffett Options,,,,,,
,96,Quality Can Be Variable. I Stay Almost Every Week So I Can See This Inconsistency.,,,,,,
,104,None All Very Good,,,,,,
,106,I Can Only Reiterate What A Wonderful Team You Have. Ian  Catherine  Caroline And I Am Afraid The Other Names  Slip My Mind ....They All Make It A Warm   Genuine And Fulfilling  Experience.,,,,,,
,109,Found It One Of The Best Meals We Ever Had. Could Not Get Into Restuarant Due To Advanced Bookings  It Was A Pity We Had Not Been Asked When We Booked The Room If We Were Eating In The Hotel So We Could Have Made An Advanced Booking In The Restuarant,,,,,,
,116,Great Staff  Very Helpful  Caring And Welcoming. Also Makes A Huge Difference Having Local Staff Which Makes You Feel Your Really In Aberdeen  Scotland.,,,,,,
,119,There Was A Challenge To Ensure We Had Seats In The Lounge For Pre Dinner Drinks. Despite Arriving Earlier In The Afternoon And Occupying A Window Table.,,,,,,
,121,My Wife And I Both Had Steaks For Our Main Course Which Were Absolutely Delicious And Cooked To Perfection.,,,,,,
,124,The Food Was Delicious And The Dining Experience Was Very Pleasant.,,,,,,
,137,We Were Celebrating My Sons 21St Birthday  The Staff Could Not Have Been More Helpfull - Very Impressive,,,,,,
,139,Excellent Food,,,,,,
,142,Beautiful Breakfast Also - Especially Enjoyed The Black Pudding! Many Lovely Touches E.G. Fresh Flowers On The Table. I Also Noticed The Smell Of Brasso And The Well Polished Brass Plates On The Door Etc. Despite The Heat  It Was Lovely To Have Warm White Fluffy Towels In The Bathroom.,,,,,,
,145,Lovely Food And Great Service.,,,,,,
,146,Excellent,,,,,,
,147,Comfortable And A Pleasant Yo Enjoy Our Meal,,,,,,
,152,I Also Attended A Business Event (Fmc Technologies) Upstairs In The Function Room  Everything Was Excellent With The Food And Service.,,,,,,
,155,Quantity And Quality Of Food At The Function Were Excellent. Coffee Supplied From Upstairs In Thermos Jugs (We Were Told) Was Lukewarm At Best  And Not Of A Standard To Be Expected From A 5* Hotel. A Request For Hot Coffee Sent The Lovely Young Waitress In To A Bit Of A Flap And None Was Forthcoming  As She Clearly Didn't Know How To Go About Handling Such A Request.,,,,,,
,157,Excellent Experience,,,,,,
,158,Very Diligent And Helpful Staff,,,,,,
,162,This Was Quite Possibly The Best Meal We Have Ever Had Anywhere In The World. Every Course Was Exceptional.,,,,,,
,164,Again  All Excellent In Every Way.  Thank You For A Wonderful Experience.,,,,,,
,165,More Choice On Menu Would Be Helpful Particularly Lighter Lunch Meals.,,,,,,
,166,Probably The Best Cooked Breakfast I've Had In 57 Years,,,,,,
,170,The Food Is Uniformly Excellent Whether For Lunch Or Dinner. Your Sticky Toffee Pudding Is My Favorite And In My View  The Best In The Aberdeen Area.,,,,,,
,174,Portions Were Too Large And The Menu For A 5 Star Hotel Was Disappointing.The Quality Of The Meat And Fish Was Excellent But If We Stay Again We Will Probably Go Out For Some Evening Meals,,,,,,
,175,The Temperature In The Conservatory Can Be On The Cold Side In Winter.,,,,,,
,177,The Dinners Were Excessively Greasy And Loaded With Unnecessary Fat.  The Dover Sole Was Completely Over Cooked And Was Far Too Oily.  The New Potatoes Were Unnecessarily Buttered. Etc.,,,,,,
,181,The First Night We Had Cocktails And Wine In The Bar (Loved The Piano)  Then Ordered A Light Dinner From Your Bar Menu. (We Were Told At Check-In That Food Was Available In The Bar Until 9:30 P.M.) We Knew That Would Suffice After A Very Long Day Of Travel. The Food Was Great And Was Just What We Needed! The Next Day We Had Been On The Run And We Decided To Do The Same Thing  But After Ordering Drinks We Were Told That Food Was Not Available. Confusing! The Staff Accommodated Us  But We Had The Feeling That It Was An Inconvenience. The Final Night We Dined In The Conservatory And It Was Great. (Breakfasts Were Also Very Good; My Eggs Were Cooked Perfectly Every Day.) I Guess My Point Is That If It Is Not Too Much Of An Inconvenience For The Kitchen  Offering A Bar Menu Into The Evening Is A Good Idea.,,,,,,
,188,Superb Bar  List Of Malts And Very Friendly And Knowlegdeable Bar Staff,,,,,,
,189,As It Was Our Son's Graduation We Chose The Menu Specially Prepared. We Were Not Disappointed!!! It Was Excellent.Good Choices And Beautifully Presented And Served. I Especially Liked The Carmel Pudding!!!,,,,,,
,194,Menu Could Have Been More Varied  We Ate In The Restaurant Twice  But Would Have Struggled For Choice For Further Nights.,,,,,,
,196,We Have Recommended To Others; Will Continue To Do So; And Plan To Return With Visiting Guests To Aberdeen After We Become Residents In September.,,,,,,
,198,My Husband Had Fish And He Found Too Many Bones,,,,,,
,199,Excellent Food.  The Red Russian Crab Is One Of My Favourite Dishes.,,,,,,
,205,The Food Was Good But Not Excellent And Overpriced,,,,,,
,207,Our Private Dining Room Was Set Up Beautifully And Staff Were Extremely Professional And Attentive,,,,,,
,210,We Also Had A Function Meal As Well. This Was Excellent For A Set Menue. Service Was Very Good And Efficient.,,,,,,
,215,The Waiting Staff Were Great - Very Professional  But Thoroughly Friendly,,,,,,
,216,Considering The Number Of Guest  Well Done To All.,,,,,,
,217,The Main Courses Are Huge - We Loved The Flavours But Didnt Do Justice To The Effort Which Had Gone Into The Cooking - Only Ate About A Third Of The Course.  Starters And Desserts Were Fine In Terms Of Size.  I Wondered If This Was The Hotel Catering For The American Market - Where Large Portions Are Expected.,,,,,,
,220,1St Class,,,,,,
,222,Perhaps Afew More Vegetables With A Steak,,,,,,
,223,Food Was Amazing And We Loved Every Course.,,,,,,
,233,Your Staff Excelled For Our Son's Wedding Celebration.,,,,,,
,234,It Was Very Difficult To Fault,,,,,,
,239,3 Nights Stay - Perhaps The Maximum Without A Change Of Menu,,,,,,
,241,Slight Smell Of Deep Fried Cooking,,,,,,
,245,Every Meal---Dinner Breakfast And Tea --Was Superb  The Pianist Was Marvelous Particularly With The Scottish Medley,,,,,,
,247,The Maitre D' Was Very Attentive  Professional And Nothing Escaped His Notice  He Had Everything Well Under Control  Was Pleasant And Kept His Cool Under Pressure.,,,,,,
,249,Excellent Food And First Class Service. No Apparent Deterioration In Quality/Service At The Wedding Reception Either,,,,,,
,250,Would Recommend It To My Friends,,,,,,
,251,Re Note 12 - This Tick Actually Refers To The Guide Dog Ball Held In The Ballroom  So I Was Reluctant To Tick Restaurant! (Could The Ballroom Be Considered To Be Added To That Part Of The Survey?  Spa? Unable To Utilise Due To Time Constriants On A Busy Schedule!,,,,,,
,258,Every Body So Efficient And Helpful Makes Such A Difference To A Hotel Break.,,,,,,
,260,Everything About Dinner And Breakfast Was Very Good.  Perhaps The Stone Flooring Might Not Be Right For Everyone  But We Enjoyed Both Meals Very Much Indeed.,,,,,,
,261,I Had Some Spa Treatments  All Done By Erika  She Was Excellent  The Ambiance Was Very Relaxing .,,,,,,
,263,Just Wonderful.,,,,,,
,264,Always A Pleasure To Dine With You At The Marcliffe,,,,,,
,266,Best Breakfast In Scotland And Ireland!,,,,,,
,267,Better Than Home!,,,,,,
,272,Breakfast  A Good Start To The Day.,,,,,,
,288,Everything Was Superb Both Breakfast And Dinner.  Wish The Hotel Was Nearer For Regular Dining.,,,,,,
,294,Excellent Food With Knowledgeable And Professional Staff Without Being Stuffy,,,,,,
,301,Superb.  I've Visited Several Times And It's Always A Special Experience.,,,,,,
,305,...Again Perfect,,,,,,
,306,I Thought The Food Would Have Been Better Than It Turned Out To Be.  I Had Caesar Salad With Prawns Which Contained  Iceberg Lettuce In A Dressing And No Other Type Of Leaf Which Was A Bit Dull And Unappealing. The Sauce Was Not Piquant  There Was No Amuse Bouche Before The Meal  Which Is Always A Classy Start To Any Meal  And I Thought That Would Have Been The Marcliffe's Style.  The Lemon Sole Wasn't Very Exciting  And The Dessert 'Caramel' - The Salted Caramel Icecream Was Too Salty For My Liking   But The Tarte Tatin Was Very Nice.  My Partner's Banana Dessert Was A Mess Of Gloopy Toffee Sauce.  Not Good. I Cannot Fault The Staff At The Marcliffe  They Were Exceptionally Attentive And Very Good.,,,,,,
,316,Great Dining Fantastic Breakfast,,,,,,
,336,Pity That Next Year Will Be The End Of An Era.,,,,,,
,339,It Took Some Time To Order Dinner But We Appreciate It Was A Busy Time Of Year.,,,,,,
,342,The Food  Itself  Was Excellent And The Service At Breakfast Good. However  Service At Party Night Was Very Slow And Disorganised.,,,,,,
,344,Excellent As Always  We Go To The Marcliffe For Every Birthday  Anniversary Or Graduation Meal! ,,,,,,
,345,As Always  This Was A First Class  Professional Service.,,,,,,
,346,As A Vegetarian  I Would Have Liked To Have Seen More Choice...Especially As We Were At The Hotel Over A 3 Day Period...2 Night Stay.,,,,,,
,348,We Dined In The Restaurant On Our First Night And Then At The "Bring A Party" Event On The Saturday Night.  Both Were Equally Superb.,,,,,,
,351,No,,,,,,
,357,No,,,,,,
,362,Amazing Food And Faultless Service,,,,,,
,364,Good,,,,,,
,365,The Selection And Quality Of Food During Our Meal Was Very Good.  In Particular  My Wife Is Vegetarian.  The Selction Of Food Served To Her Was A Pleasant And Welcome Suprise. This Is Credit To Your Chef/Kitchen Staff For Considering The Vegetarian Option Beyond A Bowl Of Pasta!,,,,,,
,369,If I Lived Closer I Would Make It A Regular Dining Experience.,,,,,,
,370,There Was A Wee Stone In One Of My Chips & What Looked Like A Tattie Brush Hair On Another! However The Manager Quickly Removed Them  Showed The Chefs & Apologised. Our After Dinner Drinks Were On The House! Excellent Service.,,,,,,
,372,My Company Organised A Gala Dinner And The Food Quality Was Excellent For Our 300 Guests.  The Hotel Addressed Special Dietary Needs Very Well Too.,,,,,,
,374,Excellent Menu Choice  We Thoroughly Enjoyed Both Our Dinner And Breakfast. Happy The Menu Included Gf Options.,,,,,,
,375,I Am Gluten Free And Vegetarian  So Was Delighted That You Were Able To Cater For Me On The Same Night As We Checked In.,,,,,,
,376,Went Out Of Their Way To Accommodate Our Large Party. ,,,,,,
,380,Fantastic As Always. Breakfast Wasnt Perfect  But Still Very Good.  Only Two Very Minor Complaints Was That My Egg Yolk Wasn't Runny And I Couldnt Find Spoons Next To The Granola / Cereal Etc.  This Is Very Picky Of Me  The Overall Breakfast Was Lovely.,,,,,,
,386,Just A First Class Experience,,,,,,
,389,Only Fair Due To The Appalling Behaviour Of Stewart Spence (Please See Previous Comment) - Completely Ruined Our Dining Experience,,,,,,
,392,Great Dining Venue! Would Definitely Come Back!,,,,,,
,393,Dinner Was Excellent  Especially Considering The Large Group And Distance From The Kitchen.  Also Blackpudding At Breakfats Was Excellent.,,,,,,
,394,As Usual  Ian In The Restaurant Was First Class - Entertaining  Very Knowledgable And Added To The Whole Evening. His Colleagues Were Also Very Good. ,,,,,,
,395,One Of The Best Restaurants In The North East.  For Me  Still The Best Place For A Fillet Steak.,,,,,,
,399,I Have Experienced Family Weddings  Private Dining Rooms And The Restaurant And All Have Been Of A High Standard.,,,,,,
,401,No,,,,,,
,405,Food Was Exquisite  Staff Were Very Helpful  Lovely Experience..,,,,,,
,407,Staff Were Late In Providing Sauces For The Meal And The Quality Of Wine Was Poor.,,,,,,
,408,Excellent From The Welcome To The Cheese Board And Coffee,,,,,,
,416,We Ordered Room Service As The Restaurant Was Fully Booked  But The Food Was Delicious,,,,,,
,417,Again A Very Enjoyable And Relaxing Experience.,,,,,,
,419,No,,,,,,
,422,Directed To A Seating In The Bar. Had To Go Up To The Bar To Order Our Drinks. 
Too Many People Asking Us How Our Meal Was Whilst We Were Eating.
Turbot Overcooked.
Scallops - Delicious,,,,,,
,423,Restaurant Experience Was To.The Usual High Marcliffe Standard,,,,,,
,425,The Usual High Quality Dining Experience,,,,,,
,428,I Liked The No Nonsense Way "Extras" Like Potatoes Were Included And The No Tweeting While Eating Statement.,,,,,,
,435,The Food Was Excellent And Would Not Hesitate In Giving Family And Friends A Recommendation And Your Staff Were Very Helpful And Attentive.,,,,,,
,436,One Small Point  I Am Lactose Intolerant Which The Kitchen Were Well Aware  Of So My Main Course And Starter Were Made To Suit  It Would Have Been Enjoyable To Have Had A Dessert Applicable Instead Of Once More Having To Have Ice-Cream Or Sorbet  Delicious As They Were.,,,,,,
,439,Excellent  Exceptional Wine List,,,,,,
,445,Excellent Food  Great Selection  Good Local Produce ,,,,,,
,446,Food And Staff Were Fantastic,,,,,,
,448,Excellent Front Of House And Chef Team.,,,,,,
,449,Get Rid Of The Burnt Cooking Smell By Installing Better Extraction,,,,,,
,451,No - Still The Best In Aberdeen,,,,,,

,170,Excellent Venue For Private  Small Group Dinners.,,,,,,
,196,I Would Recommend It As A Retreat For Management Meetings Based On My Experience With The Venue And The Staff.,,,,,,

,399,I Am An Executive Coach And My Focus Is Now Switching From London To My Home Town Of Aberdeen. Usually  I Would Meet The Coachee At Their Own Organisation. Otherwise  My Business Need Would Be A Small Room When I Visit Which Would Be Met By The Business Centre If I Have Sole Access.,,,,,,

,----------------------,,,,,,,
,1,Slightly Noisey Outside Treatment Rooms Due To The Fact Of A Nail Bar Set Up And Girls Chatting!  Although This Did Not Really Bother Me As My Treatment Intself Was Lovely.  The Spa Lady Was Very Applogetic And Offered Us A Complimentary Treatment The Next Morning!,,,,,,
,61,It Was Noisy And During My Massage I Could Hear Staff Chatting Outside The Door And The Phone Rang Constantly Which Wasnt Very Relaxing.  Treatment Was Not To The Standard I Expected.,,,,,,
,83,I Would Have Expected There To Be A Steam Room  Sauna And Pool In A Facility Of Such A High Standard. Not Having A Sauna Or Steam Room (Could Have Lived Without The Pool) Was Disappointing As We Were At The Hotel To Celebrate Our Wedding Anniversary And Were Here Just To Enjoying The Hotel Food  Service And Facilities. I Did Not Booked Any Spa Treatments Before Coming To The Hotel As I Was Not Advised To Do So When I Booked My Room. When I Phoned Once I Arrived There Was No Availability For Any Treatments On The Saturday At All And Only 1.5Hrs Available Between The Two Of Us On The Sunday. Perhaps All Guest Should Be Advised To Booked Spa Treatments Before Arriving At The Hotel As The Spa Appears To Be Very Busy At Weekends.  ,,,,,,
,106,I Have Only Had A Wash And Blow Dry And Regardless Of The Short Notice They Have Always Worked Me Into The Day.,,,,,,
,186,On Spa Package Needed More Time For Nail Polish To Dry,,,,,,
,239,Did Not Enjoy Manicure Sitting In Reception Area.,,,,,,
,261,With A Better Room For A Disabled Person  We Would Come Again. Sadly You Are Closing Anyway.,,,,,,
,305,No More Comments Necessary.. Everything Was Excellent,,,,,,
,317,I Was Unable To Use The Disabled Parking As One Space Was Occuoied By A Young Fit Man Who I Saw Arrive And Display A Blue Badge. He Was Assisted By Your Porter Who Must Have Been Aware That There Was No Disability   I Presumed That He Was Parked There Merely To Unload His Luggage But I Noted Later That A Blue Badge Was Being Displayed. This Is Obviously Not The Fault Of The Hotel But The Porter Could Check That The Badge Displayed Is Relevant To The Occupant Of The Vehicle As Only 2 Disabled Spaces Are Available.,,,,,,
,346,Please See My Earlier Comments Regarding The Spa.,,,,,,
,374,Thank You For An Excellent Weekend!,,,,,,

,1,I Wish I Could Remember The Staff Names But To Be Honest All The Staff Were Great And We Were Made To Feel So Special.,,,,,,
,15,The Staff Were Exceptional.  I Do Not Remember Names Specifically.  Your Whole Receptionist Staff Were Excellent.  Furthermore The Porter Who Brought My Suitcase To The Room Addressed The 'Little Things' Extremely Well.  This Included Putting My Suitcase (Right Way Up) On The Suitcase Stand  But Also Briefly Explaining The Intricacies Of The Room And Giving Some Insight Into The Spa & Other Amenities Available To The Guests.  He Came Across Very Professional.  Top Job.  Additionally  The Private Taxi Service The Marcliffe Has Is Excellent.  The Taxi Itself Was Immaculate  The Driver Professional  On Time And Very Interesting  And The Service As A Whole Very Good Value For Money As Well.,,,,,,
,17,Lindsay At Reception Was Really Helpful When I Phone Before Our Stay  Arranging A Late Check Out During The Stay And Speaking To The Resturant On Sunday Afternoon So We Could Get A Sandwich Rather Than A Full Meal.,,,,,,
,18,All Staff Were Fantastic.,,,,,,

Linsey Very Welcoming And Made Us Feel Very At Home  Always Happy And Friendly  I Also Have To Mention Liz Who Served During Breakfast And Spolied Us With Loads Of Amazing Smoke Salomon And Scrambeled Eggs.,,,,,,
,49,Effram (Night Porter) Very Helpful And Tolerated Our After Hours Drinking.,,,,,,
,50,Previous To Our Stay Last Week We Were Staying In A Hotel In London For Four Nights.  I Can't Put Into The Words The Difference In Atmosphere Between Your Hotel And The London Hilton Metropol Which Was Completely Faceless.  I Have No Idea How You Do It But The Marcliffe Is A Huge Boost To Aberdeen's Reputation.,,,,,,
,51,James .... He Was Very Friendly And Knowledgable Of Our Stay  Restaurant Reservations  Etc.,,,,,,
,55,The Maitre D Was Particularly Friendly And Made Us Feel Very Comfortable Before And During Dining.  He Seemed To Genuinely Enjoy His Job And Made It Look Effortless And Always Had A Smile.,,,,,,

,95,Girl On Reception When We Checked In And Gentleman On Reception When We Checked Out Were Both Very Friendly  Efficient And A Definite Asset To Hotel.,,,,,,
,96,Everyone Is Great!,,,,,,
,100,As We Stay At The Marcliffe Regularly All The Staff Make Us Feel Welcome And At Home.,,,,,,
,106,Ian Has Always Been Exceptional.Very Attentive Yet Never Over Whelming.  A Very Gifted Host. Caroline At Reception  Does All She Can To Ensure That I Have A Room And That All My Needs Are Attended To.  The Gentleman Overseeing All Who Comes And Go Is A Landmark On My Travels To The Marcliffe.  He Is Always There To Ensure I Have All I Need As I Embark On My Next Leg Of My Journey.,,,,,,
,109,No,,,,,,
,114,Ian In The Resturant  Very Friendly And Locally Polite And Very Interested In His Guests.,,,,,,
,119,Stephanie - Trainee Manager Very Welcoming And Accommodating.,,,,,,
,120,Trainee Manager In The Bar (Dark Hair),,,,,,
,121,Restaurant Manager - Only Having Stayed At The Hotel Very Occasionally He Was Very Aware Of My Name And Was Very Friendly And Courteous And Nothing Was Too Much Trouble To Explain.,,,,,,
,122,The Reception Staff And The Restaurant Staff Deserve Praise For Their Attentiveness And Great Service During My Visit.,,,,,,
,124,Everyone Was Very Friendly And Accommodating.,,,,,,
,131,Everybody Was Friendly And Helpful,,,,,,
,134,The 2 Girls  On The Front Desk And The Porter Were Amazing At Organising Transport And Booking A Restaurant For Us And Our 3 Children  Nothing Was A Bother And Everything Carried Out As Soon As They Said It.  I Wish I Could Remember Their Names  They Need A Big Pat On The Back!  My Husband Was Incredibly Well Looked After At The Bar And Mentioned Him The Next Morning At Breakfast...He Was Back On Again In The Morning!,,,,,,
,139,Graham The Maitre D,,,,,,
,142,Didn't Note Names  But The Girl At Reception And The Breakfast Staff Were Particularly Courteous.,,,,,,
,145,The Scottish Chap (Slightly Older Than The Rest Of The Team) Was Very Polite And Attentive - He Took Our Food Order In The Bar.  Very Amiable Character And Very Efficient.,,,,,,
,146,No They Were All Good,,,,,,
,147,All Staff Were Very Efficient In Their Roles,,,,,,
,152,The Staff Were Excellent  Remembered Little Things That Made A Difference.,,,,,,
,162,The Gent Who Showed Us To Our Room And Then Helped Us To Move Rooms  As Well As Retrieving My Husband's Mobile Phone And Car Keys When We Left Them Behind. The Waitress Who Attended Us At Dinner ,,,,,,

,185,Yes  Gary  Marcus And Ian.,,,,,,
,188,Barkeeping Staff,,,,,,
,189,Gary On The Bar And The 2 Ladies Who Served Breakfast . The Reception Staff Were All Excellent I Did Not Notice Their Names.,,,,,,
,191,I Was More Than Happy With The Reception Desk. I Had Been Away From Home On Business To Dubai & Sydney For 6 Weeks And In Aberdeen For Meetings Plus Had Not Seen My Wife On Arrival In Scotland. We Have A Small Dog Which I Thought Would Prevent Her Coming To Aberdeen To Stay With Me. As It Turned Out  The Receptionist Went Out Of Her Way To Make This Happen  Relocating My Room To The Ground Floor And Providing Dishes For The Dog  Poo Bags Etc. I Was Most Impressed By This And We Had A Very Pleasant Stay At The Hotel. I Also Found Out More About The Surrounding Area To The Hotel By Walking And Not Driving.....,,,,,,
,195,The Person On Reception When I Checked Out In The Early Morning. He Arranged For Me To Have A Take Away Coffee And Bacon Roll As I Had To Leave Before Breakfast Was Due To Be Served. He Volunteered The Service - I Did Not Need To Ask. I Left With A Very Positive Impression Of Your Hotel.,,,,,,
,196,Marcus The Bartender Took Extreme Care To Learn Our Peculiar Preferences Wrt Drinks And Was Consistent And Attentive Throughout Our Stay.  We Wanted To Express Our Appreciation Directly To Marcus Before We Left  But We Missed Him So We Are Happy To Be Able To Acknowledge Him Through This Process.  To A Person  The Staff Was Courteous  Attentive And Capable.,,,,,,

,247,Yes  The Maitre D' So Efficient And Yet So Very Approachable And Caring.,,,,,,
,249,I Can't Remember Her Name - Dark Haired Girl With A Local Accent. She Dealt With Us Initially When We Arrived. It Was Really Great Customer Service From My Point Of View When About A Couple Of Hours Later  When I Approached Reception To Ask To See The Wine List  This Lovely Girl Remembered My Name. Not Only That  But She Did The Same The Following Day. That Is A First Class Advert For Your Training!,,,,,,
,251,Very Difficult To Pick Out Someone Outstanding  As Each Had Their Own Special Personality To Share With Us  But That Standard Was So Consistant And Of Such A High Standard It Would Be Unfair To Say Or Think That Others Weren't 'Up To The Mark'!,,,,,,
,258,They All Knew There Job And Did It So Well Especially In The Dining Room.,,,,,,
,261,All The Staff We Came Into Contact With Were  Amongst The Best We Have Encountered Anywhere In The World. Very Well Run Hotel.,,,,,,

He Asked Us If We Had Stayed There Before And Made Suggestions Of Some Of The Services We Could Enjoy During Our Stay - Snooker Room Spa Etc .  I Thought He Was Great And Very Pleasant.  I Really Can't Fault Your Staff.  A Well- Oiled Team.  Impressive.,,,,,,
,316,Remaster Aunt Staff And Breakfast Staff Ladies Were Lovely   Your Staff Are Very Attentive *****,,,,,,
,328,Hard To Pick Any One Person Because There Is Clearly An Ethos Of Excellent Staff Service And Expertise Throughout. This Kind Of Professionalism Only Comes  I Know  From Serious Staff Taining And Commitment From A Very Senior Level,,,,,,
,336,Tony,,,,,,
,344,Ian In The Restaurant - Always Efficient And Professional.,,,,,,
,346,I'm Not Sure If You Are Asking About The Hotel Staff Or Spa Staff In This Section.  The Hotel Staff Were All Very Friendly  Polite And Helpful.  The Spa Staff Were Unprofessional And Exceptionally Rude When Overheard Talking About A Client.  ,,,,,,
,351,No,,,,,,
,352,Mr. Milne  Maitre De Hotel  Was Outstanding.,,,,,,

,371,All Equally As Efficient And Helpful,,,,,,
,372,The Banqueting Team Are First Class And Made Our Event Run Very Smoothly.  Reception And Breakfasting Staff Were Friendly And Professional.,,,,,,
,380,I Do Not Know His Name - But The Same Man Attends To Us Every Time We Visit In The Restaurant  And He Is Excellent. Also Diane Who Attended To Us Throughout Our Wedding Reception ( August 2012) Was Excellent And I Honestly Couldnt Thank Her Enough!,,,,,,
,386,The Porter That Found Out The Source Of Noisy Neighbours On The Floor Below,,,,,,
,389,Stewart Spence - Shouldn't Be Allowed Anywhere Near Paying Guests - As He Isn't A Team Member I Have Not Taken His Behaviour Into Account For The Above

The Rest Of The Staff Were Superb,,,,,,

,401,No,,,,,,
,404,The Ladies Who Serve Breakfast Are Friendly And Attentive To My Needs And I'd Single Them Out As Great Assets To The Hotel Team.  I Attend The Breakfast At 6:30Am (Opening) And They (The Staff) Make Me Smile Everytime.,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,
,----------------------,,,,,,,
,1,Everything Was Perfect,,,,,,
,9,A Later Check Out Would Have Been Preferred,,,,,,
,15,None,,,,,,
,20,Swimming Pool On Site.,,,,,,
,27,It Is Not A Must  But A Little Drink Or Cake Or Something More Then A 'Card' For Our Honeymoon Would Have Been Nice (Considering That We Have Received Such Treatment In All Other Hotels Were We Stayed In Scotland). The Experiance Was Just Devasted By The Slow Slow Slow Dinner Experience!,,,,,,
,32,Everything Was Wonderful.,,,,,,
,35,Please See Comments Reference Bar Area,,,,,,
,42,Yes A Swimming Would Be A Great Asset To This Hotel  Miss The Use Of One When We Stay This Your Hotel,,,,,,
,45,Just Keep Doing What You Do.,,,,,,
,47,We Had Booked The Marcliffe Because It Was Our 10Th Anniversary And On Our Wedding Day We Held Our Reception At The Marcliffe Due To The High Standard Of Service We Received However Unfortunately After A Lovely Meal Things Started To Go Downhill.  We Were Very Disappointed With Regards To The Medsoc Ball Being Held At The Hotel Because We Were We Disturbed At 12:30Am Due To People Carrying On Outside Due To Excessive Alcohol Consumption And The Bus Driver Taking Them Home Kept The Engine Running All The Time With No Consideration For The Guests.  I Do Remember There Being Security At The Hotel However It Would Appear That This Was Not Effective At The End Of The Night Due To The Disturbances And As A Result Were Unable To Sleep Until After 2Am.  We Did Complain To The Front Desk And Was Told They Were Just Collecting The Final Guests But By This Time The Damage Was Done But On Check-Out We Were Compensated However We Would Have Preferred That The Situation Was Handled Differently To Minimise Such Disturbances.,,,,,,
,50,I Should Have Said Met Expectations Because Everyone Expects Nothing But The Absolute Best From The Marcliffe!!,,,,,,
,51,Nothing At All.  Exceptional Service As Always.,,,,,,
,57,The Doors To The Rooms Could Do With Updating.  Hotel Is Very Quiet Save For Door Slamming  As The Doors Don't Quite Shut Smoothly And The Locks Are Not Smooth Click Shut.  Would Suggest Updating The Doors With Modern Hotel Locks (Click Shut And Silent)  ,,,,,,
,59,Although Not A Criticism I Feel The Reception Staff Could Have Offered A Few Words About The Hotel Facilities Which Could Have Included Where The Facilities Are And What Was On Offer. Possibly The Staff Had Assumed I Had Stayed At The Hotel Previously Which Was Not The Case.,,,,,,
,65,No,,,,,,
,71,No,,,,,,
,73,No.,,,,,,
,76,Stayed Longer.,,,,,,
,91,Stay Open Longer Than November 2014!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,,,,
,92,The Gym Is Small. Increase The Number Of Threadmill. Wasted Time Waiting For Someone To Finish Before Being Able To Exercise.,,,,,,
,94,Challenging To Get Hold Of A Taxi Upon Departure Despite Having Booked One The Night Before. Ended Up Arriving 15 Minutes Late Somewhat Critical In Rush Hour Towards The Airport.,,,,,,
,95,Only Slightly Negative Comment Would Be That When We Went Into The Lounge For Drinks Before Dinner It Was Fairly Busy  We Had To Look Around For Seats And When We Did Find A Table It Still Had The Nuts And Olives From The Previous Guests On It.  We Would Have Appreciated A Greeting When We Entered The Lounge As We Did Feel Slightly Awkward Having To Stand And Look All Around Us Until We Could Find Ourselves A Table.  However  When A Member Of Staff Did Come Over To Us She Was Very Nice And Apologised For The Messy Table.  It Is Only A Very Minor Complaint.,,,,,,
,96,Better Control Of Room Temperature. Better Water Pressure. Modern Showers. Consistent Water Pressure When Showering. Faster Internet Via Wifi  3G Signal Provides A Faster Service And That Is Unusual! Iphone Docks.  Apple Tv On In-Room Tv.,,,,,,
,97,The Food Was Especially Lovely.,,,,,,
,100,No,,,,,,
,104,Nothing Very Enjoyable,,,,,,
,106,Absolutely Nothing:),,,,,,
,107,Not Put Us In Room 301.,,,,,,
,109,I Felt,,,,,,
,111,When Checking Out Person Answered Phone Whilst Checking Me Out  Which Wasn't Great. I Also Feel A 10.30 Check Out Time Is Too Early.,,,,,,
,113,We Stayed For Bed And Breakfast And Breakfast Was Not As Good As It Could Have Been Because: - The Coffee We Had For Dinner Was Excellent But Not As Good For Breakfast  - I Ordered A Waffle Which I Expected To Have Been Prepared On Order But Found That It Looked And Tasted Like It Hadn't Been  With Hard Lumps Of Sugar Which Also Made It Very Sweet With The Maple Syrup.  Dinner However Was Excellent  No Complaints There. Sadly  Breakfast Being Potentially The Last Meal Eaten On The Premises And The One Which Sets You For The Day  We Were Disappointed.,,,,,,
,114,A Swimming Pool.,,,,,,
,119,Breakfast Service Was Slow. Had Read And Understood The Notice In Room Re Cooked Food But Maybe More Staff Can Sort Out The Simple Stuff Like Tea And Coffee.,,,,,,
,120,More Coffee Sachets In The Room,,,,,,
,134,We Were Staying With 3 Children  Two 11 Year Olds And One 9 (10 In 2 Weeks) Year Old.  We Had Intended To Stay At The Marcliffe For Dinner And Had Packed Accordingly For Dress Code For Evening Dinner.  However  We Felt That  On Reflection  We Were Better Dining Out As The Children Didn't Appear To Be Catered For With The Information Provided In The Room.  We Didn't Ask  We Just Decided To Use The Yellow Pages Provided In The Room And Look Up A Local Restaurant.  The Girls Would Have Been Happy With Room Service  But We Did Have Our 'Finery' For Dining And Thought We Would Go Out!  I Was A Little Disappointed We Didn't Get To Dine At The Hotel  I Have Heard Many Excellent Reports And Was Looking Forward To That.,,,,,,
,139,The Final Bill Was Incorrect However This Was Quickly Corrected And Apologies From Staff Given,,,,,,
,142,Air Con In The Bedroom.,,,,,,
,145,See Previous Comments.,,,,,,
,146,No,,,,,,
,147,We Were Very Satisfied With Our Stay,,,,,,
,155,A Later Check In Time Would Have Been Appreciated. 10:30 Am Is Early When Breakfast Is Served Till Then. It All Felt Quite Rushed In The End  And We Would Have Enjoyed Spending More Time At Breakfast.,,,,,,
,157,Ask Staff/Guests Not To Stand Outside Smoking And Making Lots Of Noise,,,,,,
,162,The Only Criticism We Had Was Of Breakfast. I Recall That Was A Bit Of A Problem Before Aswell. The Waitress Was Slow To Take Our Order For Cooked Breakfast Despite Us Being The Only Ones In The Restaurant For A While. When The Breakfast Came  My Husbands Eggs Benedict Had Skin Across The Sauce And Looked As If It Had Been Kept Warm For Some Time. My Breakfast Was Lovely Except For An Over-Cooked Poached Egg.  We Didnt Get Offered Any Fresh Refill Of Coffee  Which Was A Shame. Otherwise It Was An Absolutely Lovely Stay And We Hope To Be Back Before You Disappear!,,,,,,
,164,Can't Think Of A Thing.,,,,,,
,166,No  It Was Perfect,,,,,,
,168,Develop Some Better Dedicated Taxis Arrangements  Given The Traffic Congestion Local To New Marcliffe.,,,,,,
,171,Only To Have Been Met At The Door On Arrival As Was The Case On Previous Visits.,,,,,,
,174,Review The Dining Experience. We Moved On To Stay At Kinloch House Where The Dining Experience Was Infinitely More Enjoyable,,,,,,
,181,I Thought The Marcliffe Would  Be Very Nice And It Was.,,,,,,
,188,Make Me Feel Welcome And Don't Treat Us Like Convention Members Who May Pinch The Bathroom Amenities....,,,,,,
,191,No  Absolutely Fantastic As Usual  Don't Change A Thing!,,,,,,
,195,Service At Lunchtime Was Slower Than We Had Anticipated. An Order Of One Main Course Each Took 35 Minutes. Lunch Then Had To Be Rushed Which Spoiled Our Enjoyment Of It. We Were Under Pressure To Take A Taxi To The Graduation Venue.,,,,,,
,199,None At All.,,,,,,
,201,No,,,,,,
,210,A Swimming Pool Would Be Nice.,,,,,,
,211,Room Was Adequate But Not Impressive,,,,,,
,214,Better Room And Better Internet Connection.,,,,,,
,217,Only Problem Was The Mix Up With Booking... Which I Dont Think Was Down To Us And Was Dealt With Efficiently By Reception.,,,,,,
,220,No,,,,,,
,223,No. Everything Was Perfect.,,,,,,
,228,Reduce The Prices !,,,,,,
,233,Very Little Frankly. Our Stay Was Delightful.,,,,,,
,238,No,,,,,,
,239,Not That Comes To Mind,,,,,,
,240,Afternoon Tea Was Included With Our Stay - Was Asked For Â£37.50 On Departure!,,,,,,
,242,No Spa Appointments Available During Our Say.  Very Loud Party Departing Saturday Night 12 To 2Am.  Fire Alrm Went Off Twice After We Were Asleep.,,,,,,
,245,Our Experience Exceeded Expectations Which Were Set High Based On Our Previous Stay,,,,,,
,247,I Cannot Think Of Anything.,,,,,,
,249,No! (Shame About The Seagulls On The Terrace But That Is Beyond Your Control.,,,,,,
,250,No,,,,,,
,251,If You Could Have Halted The Rain That Evening  It Would Have Been A Perfect Blessing! That Is Not A Comment To Assist Any Smokers! (I'm A Non-Smoker). Time Just Flew Too Quickly!,,,,,,
,253,Sort Out The Failure Of Hot Water To The Fyvie Suite Which Occurred Twice,,,,,,
,258,No.,,,,,,
,260,Perhaps A Good Jazz Trio Rather Than A Cocktail Pianist(Who Was Very Good).,,,,,,
,261,As I Said Previously The Problems With The Facilities In Bedroom & Bathroom For Wheelchair,,,,,,
,263,I Am Sure You Would Be Able To Think Of Something But I Certainly Could Not. We Had Everything We Required And More.,,,,,,
,264,Everything Is Always Excellent - And Therefore Can Never Be Exceeded.,,,,,,
,267,Nothing.  At The Marcliffe I Have Come To Expect Excellence And That Expectation Was Met In Full,,,,,,
,288,No,,,,,,
,299,No,,,,,,
,317,No,,,,,,
,329,Don't Close.,,,,,,
,336,No,,,,,,
,344,No Everything Was First Class And Professional.,,,,,,
,346,The Staff In The Spa Need To Professional At All Times...In Caring For The Clients During Treatments And They Should Know Never To Talk About Clients - Within Earshot Of Other Clients Or Otherwise!  Very Unprofessional And Not What We Expected To Find At The Marcliffe.  ,,,,,,
,351,No,,,,,,
,357,Improve Parking - Dedicated Residents Area?,,,,,,
,362,Other Than Providing Me With The Winning Lottery Numbers  So I Could Stay Here Every Weekend :) There Is Nothing Else I Could Suggest As The Whole Experience Was Faultless. ,,,,,,
,363,No,,,,,,
,364,To Have A Later Checkout And Breakfast  And To Have Posted My Postcard Would Have Been Nice.,,,,,,
,368,Spa Was Closed Due To A Charity Event That Evening,,,,,,
,369,Stopped The Rain So We Could Have Had A Look At The Grounds!!!,,,,,,
,370,No,,,,,,
,372,No Not Really.,,,,,,
,377,The Gym Was Disappointing Compared To Other Hotels I've Stayed In Recently So I Didn't Use It Despite It Being Close To My Room ,,,,,,
,380,Would Be Lovely If The Hotel Had A Pool / Leisure Facilities On Site.,,,,,,
,386,Not One Thing ,,,,,,
,387,Only As Above. Guess As It's Closing In 9 Months It Won't Matter Anyhow ,,,,,,
,390,No Everything Perfect,,,,,,
,392,The Account Has Not Been Finalised Yet. ,,,,,,
,394,No,,,,,,
,399,I Felt An Engagement With Their Transition In The Autumn. I Held Back From Offering As I Am Not A Specific Employment Adviser Although I Am Reflecting On Whether I Could Pro Bono Some Work On Cvs And Interview Technique/Coaching. I Was Thinking About Approaching Stewart About It Although There May Be Clear Processes In Place Already Which I Would Not Wish To Affect. Maybe Just Another Perspective From A Grateful Client Wishing You All Well.,,,,,,
,401,No,,,,,,
,404,Re. Previous Comment About Channel Availability For Myself Who Is A Long Stay Guest,,,,,,
,405,For The Hotel Not To Be Closing!!!!!!,,,,,,
,408,Cant Think Of Anything That Would Have Enhanced Our Experience,,,,,,
,412,Not Really. We Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay And Wish It Had Been Longer!,,,,,,
,414,No. Being Upgraded Was A Very Pleasant Surprise And Made The Stay That More Enjoyable.,,,,,,
,416,No  Everything Was Perfect,,,,,,
,419,No,,,,,,
,422,When We Checked Out We Were Asked About Our Stay And Explained About The Extractor Fan. The Receptionist Apologised But Not Really With Any Conviction. 
We Had Paid  Time To Move On.,,,,,,
,425,Got The Bill Right. I Was Overcharged For The Wine Having Been Charged For Two Bottles Instead Of One. ,,,,,,
,428,We Just Wish We Had Had More Time To Stay And Soak Up The Grounds,,,,,,
,435,Brilliant!,,,,,,
,440,No,,,,,,
,445,No ,,,,,,
,448,Magically Found Time To Let Me And My Wife Stay Longer---It Was A Delight.,,,,,,
,449,Make Sure The Owner Does Not Interfere With The Guests,,,,,,
,451,Nothing Comes To Mind.,,,,,,

,1,Thanks To All The Staff Who Looked After Us Especially Marion And Doreen Who I Arranged This Surprise Through.  We Look Forward To Returning To The Marcliffe Very Soon.  I'm Thinking Of An Afternoon Tea With The Girls As That Looks Amazing!,,,,,,
,7,We Had A Very Enjoyable Stay And Look Forward To Dining/Staying At The Marcliffe In The Future.,,,,,,
,10,We Had A Great Stay But Both Felt The Food Was Average. Other Than That Everything Was Excellent In Particular The Staff.,,,,,,
,15,As Someone Who Has A Lot Of Family Living In Aberdeen I Will Unlikely Be A Regular Staying Overnight At The Hotel.  However I Will Strongly Recommend The Hotel To Any Visitors  Guests  Work Colleagues Or Other Acquaintances Of Mine Who May Happen To Be Staying In Aberdeen.,,,,,,
,18,Delicious Breakfast.,,,,,,
,20,Will Definitely Be Staying Again!,,,,,,
,22,Delicious Breakfast,,,,,,
,24,We Were Not Shown Where The Spa Facilities Were On Arrival.,,,,,,
,27,If You Have Dinner Reservations Keep The Timing Please! 5 Star Location Shouldn't Fail On Such A Thing. Maybe But Someone In The Hall To Attend New Arrivals.,,,,,,
,32,We Got Married At The Marcliffe And Come Every Year For Our Anniversary. Staff Are Always Lovely And Food Is Always Amazing. We Hope To Visit The Marcliffe For Many More Anniversary's.,,,,,,
,36,We Were Staying On The Season Package Which Includes Two Nights Stay However On Departure The Season Package Had Been Added Twice To Our Bill On Two Consecutive Days The 28Th And 29Th. I Pointed This Out To The Member Of Staff Who Checked The Offer Details And Agreed The Second Seasons Package Shouldn't Be On The Bill And It Was Removed. I Did Feel A Bit Concerned Upon Initially Viewing The Bill As Due To The Second Package Being Present It Was Significantly Higher Than I Had Anticipated But The Error Was Corrected.,,,,,,
,38,The Communal Areas Of The Hotel Were Excellent  Lounge Etc Breakfast Was Delicious But Sorely Disappointed With Our Bedroom. I Felt Like Because We Had Taken One Of Your Special 3 For 2 Night Offers We Were Given A Room Which Didn't Really Matter And We Had No Grounds To Complain About The Standard Of It.,,,,,,
,44,We Look Forward To Returning In The Very Near Future.,,,,,,
,45,Hopefully See You All Again Soon.,,,,,,
,49,Overall Very Good Experience. Thanks,,,,,,
,51,We Celebrate Our Anniversary Every Year At The Hotel.  You Always Make It So Special.  The Sweets At The End Of Our Dinner Was A Lovely Touch  Especially As The Chef Had Piped Happy Anniversary In Chocolate Onto The Plate.  It Was Just Such A Nice Touch.  I'm So Happy That We Had Our Wedding At The Marcliffe Back In 2002.,,,,,,
,53,Thank You A Lovely Time At Your Beautiful Hotel. Could Not Fault The Service,,,,,,
,55,Room Was Really Nice And The Food Was Excellent However The Bar Area Seemed Slightly Small For The Hotel Size And A Little Bit Dowdy - But That Would Be Really Not Picking..,,,,,,
,56,Only Gripe Was The Internet Signal  I Stayed In One Of The Junior Suites Can't Remember The Number Though.  It Didn't Matter Though As Spent Most Of My Time Downstairs Dining With Friends Who Were Not Staying.,,,,,,
,57,Wonderful Hotel Overall  I Do A Lot Of Travelling In My Job (Carlton/Westin In Usa  Ritz/Raddissons In Russia/S.Africa And Hiltons Elsewhere And Your Hotel Lived Up To My High Expectations. Lovely Feel To The Bar And Restaurant  Great Food And Surroundings  And Very Attentive Staff!,,,,,,
,59,Very Well Done For A Positive Experience. The Staff Really Do Try Hard To Offer High Value Customer Service. For A Seasoned Business Traveller That Really Is Very Much Appreciated.,,,,,,
,67,It Was Wonderful. Definitely Would Be Coming Back.,,,,,,
,68,We Used The Gym Which Was Sufficient But Could Do With A Few More Mats On The Floor For Stretching And Cool Down.,,,,,,
,71,No,,,,,,
,73,No,,,,,,
,76,Thank You.,,,,,,
,78,Its The Best Hotel That I Have Been To Outside Asia. The Service Was Exceptional And The Environment And Atmosphere Was Fantastic. What Really Pulled It Together Was Having Fresh Milk (Not Uht) In The Fridge For Coffee And Tea. That Is A Touch Of Class.,,,,,,
,80,The Staff In The Downstairs Bar Make You Feel Like Buying A Drink Is A Crime !,,,,,,
,83,We Did Have A Lovely Weekend And Would Definitely Come Back Again For The Service And Food. The Marcliffe Is The Best In Aberdeen For Both Of These Things. I Do Not Want To Be A Moan But I Hope By Being  Honest About Our Experience This May Help With Hotel Improvements.,,,,,,
,86,Such A Shame This Beautiful Hotel Is Closing!  It Will Be A Big Loss To Aberdeen As There Is Nothing Of The Same Standard.,,,,,,
,88,I Can Not Believe That You Are Closing - This Is A Real Disappointment As We Would Have Made An Annual Trip To Stay With You.,,,,,,
,89,Lovely Hotel We Had Our Wedding Reception Here So Always A Pleasure To Return.,,,,,,
,92,Hear That The Hotel Is Being Pull Down Next Year  Real Sad That No One Can Buy It Out And Retain It As A Hotel,,,,,,
,94,Great Place - Loved The Homely Touched And Appreciated The Spirit.,,,,,,
,96,It's The Quality Of Service That Makes This The Best Hotel In Town! That's Why I Keep Coming Back.,,,,,,
,97,Thank You  We Will Certainly Be Back.,,,,,,
,100,We Are Very Grateful For The Privellege Of Being Able To Stay At The Marcliffe When Ever We Need To.,,,,,,
,104,None,,,,,,
,106,It Is Absolutely The Best Home Away From Home....Perhaps Even A Little Better:),,,,,,
,107,We Had A Lovely Breakfast  But Very Tired After Our Stay.,,,,,,
,108,The Hotel Seems To Be A Bit Over Priced For The Location. So My Expectation Is Naturally Considerable Higher Than What Is Available In This Location.,,,,,,
,114,I Wish I Could Afford To Stay More Often!,,,,,,
,116,Overall An Excellent Stay. We Travel A Lot Staying In Nice Hotels For Both Business And Pleasure And This Is One Of The Better Ones We Have Stayed In Anywhere. The Local Staff Make A Big Difference And Are Truly Welcoming  Friendly And Helpful And The Food Was Of High Standard. Well Done To Management And The Team.,,,,,,
,118,The Food Restuarant And Staff Were Excellent.  The Room Was A Let Down.,,,,,,
,120,A Lovely Place .. Looking Forward To Coming Back Again,,,,,,
,124,We Are Looking Forward To Returning For Another Visit In The Future.,,,,,,
,131,My Own Fault For Not Checking My Bill But Have A Feeling I Was Overcharged In The Bar. Learn In Future To Check My Bill,,,,,,
,134,As This Was My First Visit  I Now Understand The Reputation This Fine Hotel Has  It Surpassed My Expectations With The Tiny Little Details...Like Check-In.  I Am Delighted To Have Been Given This Opportunity Through A Voucher Given As An Anniversary Present.,,,,,,
,139,It Is Really Refreshing To Be Able To Stay In A Hotel Where When You Ask For Something To Be Done It Is Without Any Fuss And With Promptness. It Is Always A Pleasure To Stay At The Marcliffe Where The Service And Food Are Exemplary Without Being Stuffy,,,,,,
,141,You Could Put In The Bathroom Demake Up Cotton...,,,,,,
,145,See Previous Comments.,,,,,,
,146,No,,,,,,
,147,Appreciated The Staff Delivering The Extra Ice To Our Suite..Without Us Requesting It...Also Checking If We Required Our Room To Be Turned Down..,,,,,,
,153,Everything Regarding The Stay Was Exceptional.,,,,,,
,155,The Addition Of A Swimming Pool Would Have Made The Stay Perfect...Not Sure If You Can Arrange That!,,,,,,
,156,As Always We Enjoyed Our Stay Very Much. The Staff Are All Lovely And Friendly And The Food Great. Looking Forward To Our Next Visit.,,,,,,
,157,I Will Not Be Staying Again Unless I Am Guaranteed Another Location Within The Hotel,,,,,,
,160,Here Is Part Of An Email That I Sent To The Hotel Yesterday.  Now For The Bad Points That I Feel You Should Make Aware To Clients  Although The Room Was Nice We Were At The Service Entrance At The Back On The Ground Floor.  We Did Not Hear A Lot Of Noise From That Admittedly However There Was A Function On Later That Night And The Band Started To Practice At 5:00Pm And They Were Really Loud For A While But Then It Quietened Down Which We Later Found Out Was Because People Had Complained.  We Went To Hand Our Room Key In When We Went Out To Meet Up With Our Friends And Complained About The Noise And Said That We Had Not Been Told When We Checked In To Which The Reply Was That We Should Have Been Told  They Said They Had One Room At The Front Of The Hotel If We Had Wanted To Move But As Were Just Going Out And Had Unpacked Everything This Was Not Practical At That Time.  They Said The Function Was Going On Until 1:00Am But Luckily For Us In A Way We Did Not Get Back To The Hotel Until Around 12:15Am.  The Band Eventually Finished At 1:15Am.   When We Went To Check Out I Said Again About The Night Before And The Girl On Reception Said She Would Pass On My Complaint To Stewart And He Would Be In Touch  I Am Still Waiting!!  All I Would Have Said Was That We Should Have Been Told Upon Check-In.  As We Were Going Out For Most Of The Night It Did Not Really Affect Us.  However If That Had Been A Client That Had Happened To Then They Would Have Been Let Down By That Service.  I Appreciate That Functions And Weddings Take Place But Clients Should Be Told At Time Of Booking So They Are Aware Or At Least At Check-In And Be Allocated Rooms Away From The Function Or Wedding If Possible.  I Appreciate That You Gave Us A Special Rate To Which We Were Grateful But We Were Still A Paying Guest.   ,,,,,,
,162,We Were Very Sorry To Learn That You Are Closing Next Year.,,,,,,
,164,Thank You For Making Our Time There Special And For Making Us Feel Wonderful. Your Premises Are Stunning And Tranquil.  The Environment Sensational And We Will Be Back Before You Close Next Year And Which We Feel Quite Sad About  But You Have Given Us A Wonderful Memory Thsnk You One And All.,,,,,,
,165,It Would Be Nice To Have A Real Spa. A Place Where There Are Saunas And Other Spa Related Functions,,,,,,
,166,After Travelling Extensively In Europe  The Us And The Middle East Over Many Years  Your Hotel Is The Best One I've Ever Stayed In.,,,,,,
,168,Thank You For A Pleasant Stay,,,,,,
,171,We Have Stayed At Other Slh Hotels Both In The Uk And Abroad And Although Each Have Been Marvelous None Can Match The Marcliffe For Overall Warmth And Experience.,,,,,,
,172,We Always Enjoy Our Breaks At The Marcliffe  And Look Forward To Our Next Visit.,,,,,,
,174,My Comments Are Harsh But You Are Holding Yourself Out To Be A Top Quality Hotel And Consequently You Deserve To Be Judged On The Highest Standards,,,,,,
,175,Next Time We Stay We Shall Ask For A Quite Room Which Hopefully Will Be Fresher.,,,,,,
,181,Loved The Parking (Easy Access  No Delay In Getting To And From Vehicle). Loved The 'Baby' Cokes And Diet Cokes And The Candy Bars In The Room (I Have Quite A Sweet Tooth). Also  Regarding The Service: It Was Really Good For Reasons Mentioned Previously  But Also Because It Was The Right Amount: Accommodating  But Not Bothersome (A Fine Line That Is Often Missed). We Were In Aberdeen For Golf (Royal Aberdeen And The New Trump Course On This Trip) And Your Hotel Was The Perfect Spot.,,,,,,
,182,Our Only Criticism Is That We Twice  On The Saturday Morning  Had Housekeeping Knock On Our Door To Make The Room Up. As We Were Checking Out At 10:30 This Seemed Totally Un-Necessary And The House Maids Could Have Left Us And The Room Alone Until After We Checked. This Comment Aside The Marcliffe Is Absolutely Suberb And Cannot Be Faulted ! Thanks To All The Team.,,,,,,
,184,All Staff Were Friendly And Helpful. Surprisingly  The Gen. Manager Seemed Somewhat Aloof.,,,,,,
,189,From Our Arrival It At The Front Gate This Looked Like A Well Managed Property. I Particularly Enjoyed The Gardens. Once Inside This Carried On Throughout. As We Are In The Hotel And Catering Industry We Notice The Little Things And The Attention To Detail Which Was Excellent. It Is All Down To The People Though And From Top To Toe Your People Were Excellent. Well Done And Keep Doing What You Do!!!! R,,,,,,
,195,Despite My Answer To The Previous Question  I Would Have No Hesitation In Staying At The Marcliffe Again When We Are Next In Aberdeen. It Is Expensive  So We Won't Stay As Frequently As We Would Like. However It Is Probably Good Value For Money As The Staff Are Exemplary  You Accommodate Dogs (Which We Brought On Our Previous Stay)  The Ambience In The Lounge/Bar Is Great And The Rooms/Beds Are Extremely Comfortable. Thank You.,,,,,,
,196,We Look Forward To Returning.,,,,,,
,199,A Wonderful Hotel.,,,,,,
,201,I Was Staying To Attend My Son's Wedding Reception (David Fulton)...The Hotel Staff Facilitated The Evening To Go Smoothly.,,,,,,
,203,The Marcliffe Well And Truly Exceeded Our Expectations.  We Were Delighted With Our Stay  And Welcome The Opportunity To Visit Again.,,,,,,
,207,It Was The Best Of 4 Similarly Rated Accommodation Venues On Our Uk Trip,,,,,,
,211,Food At Private Function Was Excellent,,,,,,
,212,Thanks For Your Attention To Detail.  Michael Quinn,,,,,,
,215,No.  We'll Be Back Soon!,,,,,,
,216,Considered The Costs  Value For Money But A 'Little' Discount For Guests Attending The Wedding Would Have Been The Normal In Most Other Hotels.,,,,,,
,220,Thank You & Hopefully We Will Be Back Soon.,,,,,,
,221,Have Already Done A Trip Advisor Entitled  Quality Shines Through Hope To Be Back Soon Thanks For Brilliant Service,,,,,,
,222,I Bid For Our Stay In An Nfus Charity Auction In May. Very Grateful To The Marcliffe For Donating D B & B For Auction. The Event Raised Over Â£27 000 For Local Charities And The Nfus Centenary Trust. Thank You,,,,,,
,223,Hope We Come Back Again Soon. This Was A Gift From A Friend And The Whole Experience Was Brilliant.,,,,,,
,225,Top Breakfast.,,,,,,
,233,Please Pass Our Thanks To All That Made The Morton/Rennie Wedding Such A Joy.,,,,,,
,238,No,,,,,,
,239,Both The Other Two Couples Who Were My Guests Thought That You Exceeded Our Expectations And Whilst I Don't Regret Not Being Able To Afford Such Luxury On A Regular Basis  Not For One Moment Did I Begrudge Spending That Amount Of Money.  It Made My 65Th Birthday Very Enjoyable Indeed,,,,,,
,241,Just Recommended You To My Brother. He Wonders If There Are Ever Special Weekend Or Weekday Rates Eg Off Season.,,,,,,
,244,A Great Stay.,,,,,,
,245,We Do Not Have Everyone's Names But All The Desk Staff Were Very Helpful When We Needed Directions For Day Trips,,,,,,
,247,Just Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Two Day Stay And Wish It Could Have Been Longer.,,,,,,
,249,Wedding Was Wonderful  Food Great  Wine Very Reasonable For A 5 Star Hotel  Which Pleased My Darling Very Much. Our Next Hotel Is The Peninsula In Beijing  Then Three Shangri-La Hotels In China. I Doubt Whether They Will Be Any Better Tha  The Marcliffe. We Have Used Fairmont (Gold) And Several Shangri-La (Horizon Club) Also. Your Service  Friendliness  Attention To Detail  Was Beyond Criticism And Better Than Our Expectations. We Usually Do Not 'Do' 5 Star In The Uk - Being Beyond Our Budget. The Visit To The Marcliffe Was A Special Occasion And So We Are Glad We Stayed At The Hotel  Rather Than Elsewhere - And We Are Also Glad We Upgraded. Next Time We Are In Aberdeen We Will Be Back - If You Will Have Us! In Fact We Must Try And Engineer A Reason For A Visit. Well Done Marcliffe -- But You Know You Are Good Anyway!!!  Russell And Elna Mclaren,,,,,,
,250,No,,,,,,
,251,I Have Been Fortunate & Managed To Travel To Some Wonderful Places In The World Due To My Unique Work In Coffee Plantations  But I Can Only Compare The Marcliffe To One Other Hotel With Such Quality And That Is The Mandarin Oriental In Geneva! Well Done To All The Staff! Thank You For Making Our Stay Just Perfect!,,,,,,
,256,We Visit Aberdeen Three Or Four Times A Year For Pleasure As We Lived And Worked Up There For Many Years. Normally We Have Stayed At Ardoe House But Your Level Of Quality Is Far Superior. We Had An Excellent Deal With You This Time And Should Be Grateful If You Can Please Let Us Know By Email Of Any Similar Deals In The Future.,,,,,,
,257,We Visit Aberdeen Area A Number Of Times Each Year And Previously Have Stayed At Ardoe House. The Marcliffe Is Far Superior Which We Would Use As Apreference. The Deal We Had With You Was Excellent And Can Only Ask That You Keep Us Updated With Any Future Deals That You May Have.,,,,,,
,258,Really Enjoyed Our Stay From Start To Finish And Hope To Repeat Next Year.,,,,,,
,260,We Have Stayed At The Marcliffe Twice. On Both Occasions We Have Been More Than Satisfied With Everything  Including The Room  The Food And The Staff. We Look Forward To Our Next Visit And Hope That The High Standards And The Individuality Of The Hotel Remain Just The Same.,,,,,,
,261,Good Luck To Everyone In The Future Who Has Been Involved With The Marcliffe,,,,,,
,263,Fabulous,,,,,,
,264,Well Done  All!,,,,,,
,265,We Look Forward And Enjoy Our Stays At The Marcliffe,,,,,,
,267,Well Done!,,,,,,
,288,I Think I Have Said It All  An Excellent Experience.,,,,,,
,299,Enjoyed Our Stay-Thank You,,,,,,
,316,A Wonderfull Night Had By Myself And Husband Totaly Felt Special,,,,,,
,328,My Business Is As A Destination Management Company For Indian Ocean And We Provide Hotel Accommodation For Tour Operators Packaging Indian Ocean Holidays. We Have To Inspect Many Hotels  Many Of Them Very Exotic (And Very Expensive!). Marcliffe Staff Are As Good Or Better Than Any I Have Seen.,,,,,,
,336,No,,,,,,
,337,A Very Big Shame That The Hotel Has Been Sold And The Site Will Be Redeveloped. A Major Loss To Aberdeen.,,,,,,
,339,Please Don't Close!,,,,,,
,344,Extremely Sad That The Hotel Is Closing Down But Glad We Took The Opportunity To Experience It This One Time.,,,,,,
,345,As A Family  We Always Dine At The Marcliffe For Birthdays  Anniversarys And Graduations. We Always Get A First Class  Professional Service Which Adds To The Special Occasion. Due To The Hotel Closing Down  We Decided This Time To Stay Overnight So We Could Experience The Facilities. We Thoroughly Enjoyed The Whole Experience!,,,,,,
,346,We Would Love To Come Back To The Hotel But Won't Be Visiting The Spa Again.  I'd Also Like To Take This Opportunity To Ask For A Refund On Our Spa Treatments For The Reasons Detailed Above.  As Mentioned Before  We Did Not Complain At The Time As We Thought It Would Spoil Our Weekend...But The Fact Is  It Did Spoil Our Weekend Because It Is What We Remember When We Look Back On Our Weekend Away.  We Feel Very Frustrated And Disappointed By This.  I Look Forward To Your Response.  Many Thanks  Lynne Wilson. ,,,,,,
,348,We Will Definitely Be Visiting Again Before Such A Lovely Place Is Closed To The Public.,,,,,,
,349,I Am Sad That You Will Be Closing Next Year.,,,,,,
,351,Thank You Very Much.,,,,,,
,357,No,,,,,,
,362,I Loved The Bathrobes Provided In The Room So Much  That When We Arrived Home I Went On The Website Of Maker And Ordered One Each For Bruce And I.  Thank You Again For A Wonderful Time. ,,,,,,
,368,Reconsider Your Impending Closure!,,,,,,
,370,Looking Forward To One Last Return Trip In The Summer Before You Close!:(,,,,,,
,372,Shame That At End Of 2014 Things Will Be Changing And Not For The Better.  Huge Loss To Aberdeen.,,,,,,
,378,Please Don't Close - I Need You!,,,,,,
,380,Fantastic Stay  Sorry That The Marcliffe Is Closing.,,,,,,
,381,Sorry To Hear The Marcliffe Is Closing In November !!!!! Where Shall We Stay Now When Visiting Aberdeen,,,,,,
,386,The Marcliffe Will Be Sadly Missed In Aberdeen As Nothing Else Offers Consistently First Class Service,,,,,,
,389,Please See Previous Comments - Quite Frankly I Expect A Personal Apology From Stewart Spence Before We Return,,,,,,
,394,We Intend To Stay Again Before The End Of The Year And Will Definitely Be Dining There In The Coming Months. ,,,,,,
,399,I Think This Is The First Feedback Q'aire That I Have Completed And Actually Had Something Meaningful To Say.,,,,,,
,400,Only A Pity That The Hotel Will Now Be Closing.  ,,,,,,
,401,Thank You So Much,,,,,,
,404,None,,,,,,
,405,Had A Lovely Time  We Even Asked If We Could Look At The Room We Got Married In  Just Because It Was The Last Time...Just Think It's So  So Sad That Come November It'll Be No More...Congratulations On Creating The Best Environment  The Most Professional Staff...And For Creating Some Lovely Memories For My Husband And I...,,,,,,
,408,No Added Comments To Make.,,,,,,
,412,Thank Your Staff For Making Our Stay So Enjoyable. It Is Appreciated.,,,,,,
,414,It Shall Be Such A Great Loss For The City Of Aberdeen When This Establishment Closes.Stuart Has Been A Stalwart Of The Hotel Industry And Always Lead By Example.,,,,,,
,417,My Only Comment Is That My Husband And I Will Be Very Sad To See The Hotel Close It's Doors Later This Year. We Will Be Staying At Least Once More Before This Happens And We Already Have A Booking For The Weekend 12Th/13Th April.,,,,,,
,419,No,,,,,,
,425,The Inaccurate Bill Did Not Spoil The Overall Experience ,,,,,,
,428,Good Luck To All The Staff  You Are A Credit To The Hotel.,,,,,,
,429,Don't Sell,,,,,,
,436,Only To Say We Are So Disappointed That The Hotel Is To Close  It Is The Only Place In Aberdeen To Give That Wow! Factor .When You Enter The Reception And The Fire Is Always Burning As Well As The Lounge It Just Feels So Homely With That Touch Of Luxury Knowing You Are Going To Be So Well Looked After  We Shall Miss Is It So Much.,,,,,,
,437,Some Noise During Night Although This Did Not Disturb Too Much,,,,,,
,439,Don't Close In November!,,,,,,
,440,None,,,,,,
,445,Lovely Hotel  Great Staff  Excellent Food ,,,,,,
,446,Thank You ! ,,,,,,
,447,Excellent,,,,,,
,448,I Wish All The Team And Management All The Very Best For The Future What Ever That May Be.,,,,,,
,451,Keep Up The Good Work  - And Don't Sell The Property. ,,,,,,

,20,Ask Guest If They Specifically Need A Paper Receipt On Checkout - Most Do Not  Or This Could Be Shown On Screen At Reception Area With Further Email Of The Document Should Guest Require E.G. Vat Purposes.,,,,,,
,31,I Think You Appear To Be A Very Green Hotel,,,,,,
,32,Can't Think Of Anything.,,,,,,
,58,I Believe Towels Were Exchanged Daily?   You Could Give Guests The Option To Reuse Towels (And Bedsheets If Changed Daily Too).,,,,,,
,73,No,,,,,,
,76,No,,,,,,
,82,No Suggestions At This Time.,,,,,,
,92,Change The Fire Place In The Lobby To Gas Instead Of Using Wood To Reduce The Number Of Trees Being Cut Down,,,,,,
,94,Please Don't Wash / Change The Towels When The Guest Has Hung Them Up To Be Re-Used The Next Day - Not Necessary  But You May Want To Introduce An Option That The Guest May Leave Them In The Bathtub/On The Floor If Requing Changing Out If Some Guests Prefer... And Deffinately It's Not Necessary To Replace All Towels - Both Used And Not Used Each Morning... Thank You,,,,,,
,96,No,,,,,,
,104,No Obvious Ideas,,,,,,
,106,No,,,,,,
,113,Fewer Towels Possibly Depending On How Long People Stay At The Hotel. We Stayed For One Night And There Were Many Towels  More Than We Were Going To Use.,,,,,,
,132,Although I Hung Up My Towel ( And Was Willing To Reuse It Again)  It Was Replaced Every Time!,,,,,,
,134,Your Pillows Are Massive  We All Only Needed 1 Pillow And Threw The Other To The Side Along With The Decorative Ones.  I Assume These Will All Be Washed  Unused.  Perhaps You Could Leave A Sign To Say Extra Pillow In Wardrobe Or Alternative  If They Are Used  Wash Them  If Not-Leave Alone!  I Also Noticed A Sheet Beneath My Duvet Cover  More Unnecessary Washing Of Items As I Also Cast This Aside  As Most People Do  Another Washed Item  Unused.  This Would Cut Down On Washing/Detergent/Time.  We Did Have A Major Amount Of Towels Also  Between The 2 Rooms.  Many Unused And 5 Of Us Had A Shower  4 'Girls' With Hair!  Perhaps Some Can Be Left In Wardrobes Again?  It Is Lovely To Be Pampered With Massive Pillows  Towels In Abundance  But I Think A Vast Majority Of People Would Understand  Or Not Even Notice A Subtle Change In Volume??,,,,,,
,146,No,,,,,,
,147,Continue Your Use Of Local Suppliers And Services..,,,,,,
,148,Talk To Myself Ref Approval To The International Recognised Environmental Standard Iso 14001  As This Was The Purpose Of Business Trip To Aberdeen. I.E. To Audit/Approve A Local Company To The Environmental Standard.  Please Give Me A Call - 07788 183248 If You Wish To Discuss Further.,,,,,,
,154,You Are Doing A Lovely Job. I Wish We Had Had More Time There.,,,,,,
,155,As Our Room  And Our Friends' Room Was Overheated  The Addition Of Room Thermostats That Guests Can Set Themselves Must Be Good For The Environment. Goodness Knows How Much Expensively Heated Hot Air Went Out Of Our Windows During Our Stay.,,,,,,
,157,Nothing,,,,,,
,164,None.,,,,,,
,165,Glad You're Concerned With This.,,,,,,
,168,Taxis/Shuttle Arrangements  Would Reduce Private Car Use,,,,,,
,169,Not That I Can See. I Presume You Are Seeking To Be Sensible With Energy Usage - And E.G. That The Building Is Suitably Insulated. You Seem To Be Using Low Energy Light Bulbs - But Watch Out That Does Not Make Rooms Too Gloomy! I Would Also Be Careful Not To Overdo This With Notes To Guests Etc About Saving The Planet.  In The End Minimising Environmental Impacts Of Energy Usgae Is A Matter For National Action. If The Uk Government Replaced Coal With Natural Gas In Electricity Generation - And This Pattern Was Followed By Other Countries Around The Globe - Then We Would See A Consdierable And Sustainable Fall In Co2 Emmissions. But Be Careful - I Am Not An Unbiased Commentator On These Issues!,,,,,,
,171,Additional Information On The Suite Atmosphere Control. We Did Not Adjust The Controls And Woke During The Night And Were Quite Warm.  ( The Underfloor Heating Is Still Wonderful ) The Shower Was Wonderful And Has Good Water Pressure But An Automatic Control To Reduce The Flow When Not Standing Under The Shower Head Would Save Water.,,,,,,
,175,We Think You Do A Good Job.,,,,,,
,181,In My Observation You Are Doing What You Can Without Creating An Inconvenience For Your Guests.,,,,,,
,188,Sell Rather Than Admonish Your Guests On Your Green Goals,,,,,,
,189,Not A Clue!!!,,,,,,
,195,Can't Think Of Any,,,,,,
,196,Towels Were Changed Daily And More Frrequently When Used.  We Would Be Happy To Re-Use Towels.  A System To Enable This Practice Would Reduce Laundry Impact.,,,,,,
,201,No New Ideas But I Thought It Good That You Had Shower And Hair Products Which Could Be Refilled And Therefore Minimized Waste From The Usual Small Bottles.,,,,,,
,210,Notices About Towel Rail Use And Heating Use  And The Changing Of Towels.,,,,,,
,220,No,,,,,,
,223,You Appear To Be Doing Everything You Can. No Further Suggestions,,,,,,

,239,No,,,,,,
,241,None.,,,,,,
,247,Cannot Assist On This One.,,,,,,
,249,Seems You Are Doing All The Right Things! I Suppose  Since You Ask -- You Could Even Offer To E.Mail The Account/Receipt Rather Than A Paper Copy? Mind You - E.Mails Can Be Intercepted And That Might Not Be Such A Good Idea? It Seemed To My Darling That You Changed The Bedsheets? We Were There For Two Nights. We Would Have Been Very Happy Without Such A Change If You Had Given Us The Choice.,,,,,,
,250,No,,,,,,
,251,Natural Light Is Always The Plus To Any Environment! Not Just Open Planning Within A Hotel  But Considering Where We Are Here In The Ne At 52N  So That We Can Site Things To Maximise Light  In Particular In The Summer  But Also In Winter  When Light Is So Precious  We Can Maximise It Use By What Is There  Letting It Penetrate Or Reflect Onto The Building Wherever Possible! Solar Power Of Course! It's Free!,,,,,,
,263,Do Not Sell This Wonderful Asset To A Property Speculator. It Is Lovely As It Is.,,,,,,
